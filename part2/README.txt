# Question 1
The source code can be found in SourceCode/Question1/.

## Links to Third-party Libraries
Note: The code to install the libraries can be found in SourceCode/task3-1/domain_specific_dataset_analysis.ipynb (first few cells). So, you don't need to download them individually.

- torch (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- nltk (https://www.nltk.org/install.html)
	- NLTK packages used:
		- stopwords
- numpy (https://numpy.org/install/)
- matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
- sklearn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

## How to Setup and Use Our System
Open and run SourceCode/Question1/LanguageModel.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/install.html) or Google Collaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/).

## Explanations of Sample Outputs
The sample outputs can be found in the output cells in SourceCode/Question1/LanguageModel.ipynb. The output files (including graphs, trained models and generated text) can be found in SourceCode/Question1/Output.ipynb. There is one folder for the model with tied weights (tie_weight/) and the model without tied weights (no_tie_weight/).

# Question 2
The source code can be found in SourceCode/Question2/.

## Links to Third-party Libraries
- torch (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- numpy (https://numpy.org/install/)
- matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)

## How to Setup and Use Our System
Open and run SourceCode/Question2/Q2-NER.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/install.html) or Google Collaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/).

## Explanations of Sample Outputs
The outputs are found in the SourceCode/Question2/output folder. The trained models are found in the SourceCode/Question2/models folder.

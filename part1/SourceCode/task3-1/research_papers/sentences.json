pupils from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds; and those from environments of poverty, abuse, or neglect (Education Trust, 2005).", "It is also clear that poor learning outcomes are often the product of diverse learner character- istics present when children enter school and relatively weak instructional interventions that struggling students encoun- ter in school (Greenwood, Maheady, & Delquadri, 2002).", "These early learning challenges often transform into more substantive problems such as grade retention, dropping out of school, increased discipline issues, and placement in spe- cial and remedial education programs\u2014outcomes that further limit student access to higher education, contribute to increased unemployment, and diminish individuals\u2019 abilities to contribute to society (Heal, Khoju, & Rusch, 1997).", "At the heart of this immense instructional challenge are Corresponding Author: Larry Maheady, SUNY Fredonia, Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Fredonia, NY 14063 (e-mail: maheady@fredonia.edu).", "72 Intervention in School and Clinic 46(2) hardworking classroom teachers who try to accommodate a rapidly diversifying student population, using an ever- expanding and often inconsiderate curriculum, and doing so often under conditions of dwindling instructional support (McLeskey, Rosenberg, & Westling, 2010).", "These classroom teachers do not need the will or desire to help all of their students to succeed; they already possess that.", "What they need are the tools for doing so.", "They need more powerful academic and behavioral interventions that can improve the performance of all students (i.e., high-, average-, and low- achieving), that can be applied on a proactive and classwide basis, and that can be sustained under existing levels of instructional support and assistance.", "Classwide peer tutoring (CWPT) is one of those potentially powerful instructional tools.", "Practice Description Classwide peer tutoring refers to a class of instructional strategies in which students are taught by peers who are trained and supervised by the classroom teacher (Green- wood et al., 2002).", "The oldest and most widely researched classwide tutoring model was developed at Juniper Gar- dens Children\u2019s Project in Kansas City, Kansas, almost 30 years ago.", "The program is currently available in manual form under the commercial title of Together We Can (Greenwood, Delquadri, & Carta, 1997).", "The Juniper Gar- dens\u2019 CWPT program emerged from collaborations among educational researchers and a classroom teacher who was trying to successfully integrate children with learning dis- abilities (LD) into her general education setting (Del- quadri, Greenwood, Stretton, & Hall, 1983).", "Importantly, the following criteria were established during initial CWPT development: The program would (a) not create extra work for the teacher, (b) benefit all children in the class, (c) use materials and resources found in existing instructional programs, (d) supplement rather than supplant current instruction, and (e) be conducted within existing instruc- tional time periods (Delquadri et al., 1983).", "It is these particular attributes that may make CWPT an appealing instructional option for classroom teachers.", "The resulting CWPT program allowed teachers to simul- taneously engage all of their students in reading, math, and spelling activities for about 30 minutes per day in each subject area.", "The program was applicable across first- through sixth- grade classrooms and was used from 3 to 5 days per week.", "Over the past 25 years, other similar classwide tutoring models have emerged: 1. peer-assisted learning strategies (PALS; Fuchs, Fuchs, Mathes, & Simmons, 1996), 2.", "The Ohio State START Tutoring Program (Heron, Heward, Cooke, & Hill, 1983), 3. classwide student tutoring teams (CSTT; Harper & 4. reciprocal peer tutoring (RPT; Fantuzzo & Ginsburg- Maheady, 1999), and Block, 1998).", "These programs expand the utility and flexibility of peer tutoring methods.", "The Juniper Gardens\u2019 model, however, is the focus of this article.", "The Juniper Gardens\u2019 CWPT program has four primary components: (a) weekly competing teams; (b) highly struc- tured, reciprocal tutoring procedures; (c) daily point earning, public posting, and contingent rewards; and (d) direct practice in functional instructional activities.", "CWPT was developed as an alternative practice activity that can be used in place of independent work time.", "It should not be done with new material but rather used with content that was taught previ- ously through direct instruction.", "CWPT has been used effec- tively to improve both basic academic skills (e.g., reading, writing, math, spelling fluency) and students\u2019 acquisition and retention of important content knowledge.", "When using CWPT, teachers\u2019 roles change from primary deliverers of instruction to facilitators and monitors of peer-teaching activities.", "A Sample CWPT Spelling Session Each week, teachers form two competing teams by having pupils select colored pieces of paper (e.g., red or blue) from a covered box.", "The number of students in class determines how many pieces of paper are placed in the box (e.g., 24 stu- dents = 12 red and 12 blue pieces).", "The teacher then puts students with the same colored paper into tutoring pairs (i.e., 6 red and 6 blue pairs).", "CWPT does not provide explicit directions regarding tutor assignment other than initially placing students who are most likely to work well together into pairs and monitoring ongoing performance to ensure that everyone is making adequate progress each week.", "If all students are performing well, then team membership and partners stay the same for the rest of the week.", "Each subse- quent week, students reach into the box and are assigned to different teams and partners.", "Throughout the year, pupils typically move from team to team and have an opportunity to work with every peer.", "Within each pair, tutoring roles are reciprocal.", "Students serve as both tutors and tutees during each session and follow a highly structured tutoring procedure.", "After pupils retrieve their tutoring materials (i.e., weekly spelling list, blank paper, and a deck of numbered cards), the teacher sets a timer for approximately 10 minutes.", "For the first 10 minutes, one pupil in each pair serves as tutor.", "Tutors present each item on previ- ously constructed curriculum materials (e.g., weekly spelling lists) and provide immediate positive and constructive feed- back (i.e., verbal and points) contingent on tutee responses.", "Maheady and Gard 73 Table 1.", "Essential Components for Implementing Classwide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) Required materials Teacher procedures Pupil procedures a.", "Team point charts posted a.", "Teacher introduces and instructs i.

"Tutees then correct their errors by writing the word correctly three times.", "If errors were corrected appropriately, tutors award 1 point.", "If tutees fail to correct their errors by either refusing or making mis- takes during the correction phase, then no points are given for that item.", "Students complete as many items as possible before the time period elapses.", "They are told that the more items they complete correctly, the more points they will earn for themselves and their respective teams.", "When the timer goes off, students reverse roles and follow the same tutoring procedures for an equivalent amount of time.", "While pupils are engaged in appropriate tutoring behav- iors, teachers move about the classroom and award bonus points to maintain high levels of implementation accuracy.", "Teachers award bonus points to tutors, for example, for (a) maintaining a brisk pace; (b) providing clear, immediate, and concise feedback; (c) using the error correction proce- dures appropriately; and (d) providing unsolicited support- ive comments.", "Similarly, tutees earn bonus points by working quickly and accurately, correcting their errors immediately and without comment, and producing high- quality responses.", "Teachers typically award up to 10 bonus points per student by writing on the top of pupils\u2019 practice sheets in a different colored pen each day (to prevent cheat- ing) and commenting on what was done appropriately.", "Teachers also try to balance the number of bonus points assigned to each team.", "After pupils have served in both roles, they add the number of points earned, including bonus points, and write their respective totals on their papers.", "Individual student points, as well as daily and cumulative team totals, are then displayed publicly on a laminated scoreboard in the front of the class- room.", "CWPT procedures typically remain in effect from 3 to 4 days per week.", "On Fridays, pupils are evaluated indi- vidually using existing assessment procedures (e.g., weekly spelling tests).", "Pupils are told that they can earn 5 points for themselves and their respective teams for each word they spell correctly on the test.", "Point earnings from weekly spelling tests are then added to cumulative point totals for each team to determine a weekly winning team.", "Team-of-the-week certificates are presented and signed by each member of the winning team.", "Certificates are then posted on the outside wall of each classroom or within the room itself.", "Each week, new competing teams are formed, thereby increasing the probability that each student will participate on a winning team, while simultaneously minimizing the possibility that cliques will develop.", "See Table 1 for a summary of the essential components for imple- menting CWPT.", "Practitioner Narrative, by Jaime Gard I was initially unfamiliar with the Juniper Gardens\u2019 CWPT program.", "I heard about it in a graduate education class I took while also teaching a remedial education class in mathematics in a local school district.", "All students in this class were identi- fied as being at risk for failure based upon poor performance on high-stakes, state-level testing and districtwide math flu- ency assessments.", "They were not particularly motivated by math and often engaged in off-task and disruptive classroom behaviors.", "At the start of the year, students often said that they \u201chated math\u201d or were \u201ctoo stupid to do math.\u201d CWPT 74 Intervention in School and Clinic 46(2) sounded like a promising alternative to motivate students and improve their math computational skills.", "I implemented CWPT with 8 fifth-grade remedial students in a small, culturally and linguistically diverse, urban elemen- tary school during the 2008\u20132009 school year.", "The group consisted of five girls and three boys who were 10 years old at the time.", "Five students were Hispanic, two were Caucasian, and one was African American.", "Of the five Hispanic students, two were classified as English language learners (ELLs).", "Two of the students had IEPs [Individualized Education Pro- grams] for documented learning disabilities.", "One student received accommodations under a [Section] 504 plan due to a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).", "Five of the eight students also qualified for free or reduced meals.", "In 2007\u20132008, six students received scores of 2 on the fourth-grade New York State math exam, and two others earned scores of 1 (minimum passing grade was 3).", "The remedial math classes were designed to supplement regular math instruction and improve student performance on high stakes and districtwide assessments.", "The eight stu- dents received math instruction from me in small groups during 60-minute instructional blocks each day.", "These ser- vices were provided by me \u201cpushing into\u201d the general educa- tion classroom and working with my small group of students.", "In addition to the 60-minute instructional block, students received 30 minutes of services in a \u201cpull out\u201d setting 4 days a week.", "CWPT was done during the 30-minute pull-out ses- sions.", "The district-adopted core math curriculum, Investiga- tions in Number, Data, and Space (TERC, 2008), was used for all instruction.", "Although the district-adopted curriculum appeared to help in some math areas, it was not particularly useful in improv- ing multiplication and division fluency.", "The goal, therefore, was to use CWPT to improve my students\u2019 computational fluency in these areas.", "This goal was important for a few reasons.", "First, basic multiplication and division fluency is critical to improved performance in upper level math courses where students are expected to apply their computational skills to solve problems.", "Second, the school district uses mathematics fluency measures to monitor pupil progress and determine who needs supplemental instruction.", "Students with the lowest benchmark fluency scores (measured in digits correct per minute) are categorized as needing intensive intervention, and students whose scores are not as low but who do not meet grade-level benchmarks are identified as being in need of strategic intervention.", "All of my eight reme- dial students demonstrated a need for intensive intervention at the start of the school year.", "Additionally, development of math fluency was included among two students\u2019 IEP goals for the year.", "From October through December, students used CWPT in multiplication, while September served as an initial base- line period.", "During February into June, students used CWPT in division, with January serving as a second baseline period.", "Students were trained initially to use CWPT during three 30-minute sessions.", "I described the procedures, selected two students to demonstrate them, and then had all students role- play the procedures while I moved around the classroom and provided positive and corrective feedback.", "Students quickly learned to move to their partners, take out the necessary materials, and practice their roles as both tutors and tutees.", "I used a 20-item checklist of all CWPT procedures to make sure that they were using it correctly.", "When pupils were using CWPT with at least 90% accuracy, we began using it formally with multiplication facts.", "Classwide peer tutoring was used in a similar way as the spelling example.", "Each week, new teams were formed by having pupils select colored pieces of paper from a covered box.", "During each session, students served as both tutors and tutees for 10 minutes each.", "Given that students were randomly assigned to teams each week and were generally working below grade expectations in their math fluency, individual performance levels were not a major consideration when forming teams.", "Instead of using weekly spelling lists, how- ever, pupils used flashcards displaying multiplication and division problems up to 12 \u00d7 12 and 144/12, with correct solutions on the back.", "Tutees were required to read each problem and provide the solution orally as well as write the problem and solve it on paper.", "Tutors provided positive and corrective feedback and points as described earlier (i.e., 2 points for correct solutions and 1 point if errors were corrected appropriately).", "I also awarded bonus points for prosocial behavior and correct use of tutoring procedures.", "At the end of each CWPT session, teams totaled their points and recorded them on a class graph.", "On Thursday afternoon, the team with the most points earned a team-of-the-week certificate.", "Students then completed their weekly math fluency assessments each Friday.", "These data were graphed for the entire group and indi- vidual pupils to monitor student progress.", "Amazingly, CWPT implementation proceeded in a very orderly manner.", "That is, half of the students, designated \u201cstayers,\u201d remained at their desks while their partners (\u201cmovers\u201d) moved next to them.", "Pupils complied well with our posted tutoring rules (i.e., move quickly and quietly, talk only during tutoring sessions, talk only to your tutoring part- ners) and appeared very excited to play the tutoring game.", "Rule following [compliance], therefore, was very high.", "It was important, however, to move through the classroom while tutoring was going on.", "This allowed me to award bonus points for good tutoring behavior while also minimizing the likelihood of cheating or point inflation.", "To further minimize the possibility of cheating, I randomly selected one pupil\u2019s paper from each team and rescored it to see if all errors were corrected, an appropriate number of points were assigned, and the point total on top of the paper matched the number awarded.", "If these conditions were met, then I gave 50 bonus points to that team.", "If scoring differences emerged, then I simply corrected the paper, inserted the appropriate total Maheady and Gard 75 on top, and did not award bonus points for that particular team.", "It is important to note that there were no instances of overt cheating or flagrant point inflation during the study.", "The use of CWPT produced immediate and noticeable improvements in all students\u2019 multiplication fluency.", "On average, the class increased their digits correct per minute by 11 digits from October to December on the district-adopted CBM assessment.", "This resulted in all students being reclas- sified as in need of strategic rather than intensive intervention.", "Closer inspection revealed that both the highest- and lowest- performing students showed comparable improvements (i.e., 11 digits for highest achiever and 10 digits for lowest performer).", "Students also improved their classroom behavior and understanding of math tasks.", "They participated much more often in class discussions and showed more confidence when solving challenging multiplication problems.", "Moreover, the complaining about math and off-task behaviors dropped considerably.", "Similar outcomes were noted when CWPT was used with division facts.", "Following a 20-minute retraining session, students used CWPT with division problems.", "Once again, all eight students displayed noticeable improvements by moving from intensive to strategic intervention classifica- tion.", "In-class performance also continued to be much better than when CWPT was not in effect.", "A few other outcomes were noteworthy.", "First, when stu- dents initially used CWPT, they responded rather slowly and only accumulated about 20 to 40 points per session.", "As the year progressed, however, they worked more quickly and typically earned in excess of 80 points per session.", "This meant that they were doing more work in the same amount of time, which is very important if they are to reduce the gap between themselves and normally achieving peers.", "Second, four of eight students received passing scores on the New York State high-stakes math assessment, whereas another improved her score from a 1 to 2.", "While all students did not meet the desired benchmark score of 3, more than half improved their perfor- mance on the state test.", "In the past, very few if any students showed similar improvements.", "Third, when CWPT was dis- continued for approximately 3 weeks in January, pupil flu- ency rates declined and complaining increased again.", "Once CWPT was resumed, all students\u2019 fluency rates rose once again.", "Perhaps most importantly, students showed remarkable changes in their attitudes toward math when using CWPT.", "They made remarks such as, \u201cI can do math now,\u201d and \u201cI used to be bad at math but now I\u2019m good.\u201d They tried more challenging math applications and even increased their use of prosocial comments toward each other.", "They became more supportive of one another and worked extra hard to help classmates who were struggling.", "Students were very proud of their improvements and even made their own line graphs to show their progress.", "Overall, I found CWPT to be rather easy and inexpensive to use.", "I was able to use existing curriculum materials in the form of flashcards, and pupils were assessed using district- adopted evaluation procedures (digits correct per minute).", "Sessions were scheduled to replace independent seatwork, my pupils enjoyed playing the \u201ctutoring game,\u201d and it fostered more positive peer interactions.", "I made only a few minor changes in Juniper Gardens\u2019 procedures.", "First, students were allowed to create their own line graphs to monitor their flu- ency progress.", "This is not normally a part of the CWPT pro- gram, but it seemed to really motivate the students and provided an opportunity to \u201cshow off\u201d for parents and peers.", "Second, there was no weekly individual test for students to earn additional points.", "Rather, daily CWPT points were added into cumulative totals, and winning teams were designated each Thursday based solely on practice session points.", "Ini- tially, I had tried to award 5 additional points for each digit correct on the Friday assessments, but this became quite time-consuming.", "Finally, initial training in the proper use of CWPT was very important, as were teacher monitoring and bonus points, to ensure students used the procedures cor- rectly.", "A brief retraining session was also needed after the holiday break.", "However, once students learned the proce- dures, they carried them out without teacher assistance even when substitutes were teaching.", "Theory Juniper Gardens\u2019 CWPT has its theoretical foundations in the effective instruction (Brophy & Good, 1986; Rosenshine, 1979), eco-behavior analysis (e.g., Greenwood, Delquadri, Stanley, Terry, & Hall, 1985), and, to a lesser extent, social learning (e.g., Slavin, 1995) literatures.", "Effective instruction theorists emphasize the importance of time and active student responding as important predictors of student learning and performance.", "They argue that classroom teachers really do make a significant difference in student learning (an unpopu- lar belief at that time) and that some teachers and instructional practices are more effective than others in improving pupil achievement.", "These theorists argue further that (a) as one increased active learning time and maintained high levels of pupil success (e.g., >80%), pupil achievement would increase irrespective of cultural, linguistic, and/or socioeconomic variables; and (b) the systematic arrangement of instructional variables could remediate and potentially prevent learning failure (Brophy & Good, 1986; Rosenshine, 1979).", "CWPT essentially harnesses these instructional variables into a game format that actively engages all pupils simultaneously, provides immediate positive and corrective feedback, and offers contingent rewards for improved academic performance.", "Eco-behavioral analysis emerged as a subarea in the field of applied behavior analysis that emphasizes the importance of contextual factors\u2014such as classroom physical arrange- ments, instructional materials, and teacher behavior\u2014and 76 Intervention in School and Clinic 46(2) their interactions with student behavior (Greenwood, Carta, & Atwater, 1990).", "Until this time, behavior analysts had focused most attention on the important relationships between student behavior and environmental consequences (e.g., reinforcement, punishment, extinction).", "Yet, emerging observational research suggested that many children failed due to insufficient \u201copportunities to respond\u201d provided in the curriculum and by teacher lessons (Greenwood et al., 1985).", "These researchers demonstrated, for example, that some students who were presumably failing because of learn- ing disabilities were actually spending very little time (e.g., less than 6 minutes per day) actively responding (i.e., reading, writing, and discussing) in class.", "Although some of their learning difficulties may have stemmed from processing difficulties, providing such few response opportunities made it highly unlikely that pupils would improve academically.", "The key to CWPT\u2019s effectiveness is that it increases all students\u2019 opportunities to respond actively in class and pro- vides motivation in the form of between-team competition, point earning, and contingent rewards.", "Moreover, the use of a reciprocal tutoring format permits all students to practice academic tasks (e.g., reading orally, spelling, doing math computations) under conditions of constant monitoring, immediate error correction, and positive consequences for correct responding (Veerkamp, Kamps, & Cooper, 2007).", "With roots also in the social learning literature (Slavin, 1995), CWPT models are not value-free; rather, they empha- size equality of opportunity, mutual assistance, shared goals, interdependency, and group cohesion (Harper & Maheady, 2007).", "Slavin (1995) noted further that at least four major theoretical perspectives (i.e., motivational, social cohesion, cognitive, and developmental) speak to the beneficial effects of peer-teaching strategies on student learning.", "Motivational theorists argue, for example, that group goals and reward structures provide incentives for pupils to help one another and thereby maximize their own success.", "Social cohesion theorists, conversely, suggest that students help each other more readily in peer teaching situations because they care more about one another (i.e., more group cohesion) and want other team members to succeed.", "In contrast, cognitive researchers suggest that the verbal and nonverbal interactions among pupils themselves enhance students\u2019 mental process- ing skills and increase their academic achievement.", "By teach- ing others, students gain a deeper understanding of the content itself.", "Finally, developmental theorists argue that collabora- tive activities among children promote growth because indi- viduals work within one another\u2019s proximal zones of development and model collaborative group behaviors slightly above their own.", "Research Evidence Buzhardt, Greenwood, Abbott, and Tapia (2007) noted that more than 35 empirical studies have been conducted to support CWPT\u2019s effectiveness.", "These studies have included both single-case and between-group experimental designs; have been conducted by independent researchers in multiple sites around the country; and have produced positive aca- demic and behavioral effects across a variety of content areas (e.g., reading, math, spelling, social studies, science, health, physical education, modern languages), developmen- tal levels (e.g., elementary, middle, high school), and edu- cational settings (e.g., general, remedial, special education classrooms).", "Research findings indicated that CWPT (a) significantly improved student academic performance on both curriculum-specific and standardized measures of achievement, (b) reduced disruptive behavior (Mitchem, Young, West, & Benyo, 2001), and (c) enhanced interpersonal interactions among students from different cultural and lin- guistic backgrounds (e.g., Madrid, Canas, & Ortega-Medina, 2007) as well as between children with disabilities and their normally developing peers (e.g., Sideridis et al., 1997).", "The most compelling empirical support for CWPT, however, came from a 12-year experimental longitudinal study (Green- wood, Delquadri, & Hall, 1989).", "Here, researchers compared groups of at-risk and nonrisk students who did and did not receive CWPT.", "They found that CWPT (a) increased students\u2019 active engagement during instruction in Grades 1 to 3; (b) improved student achievement at Grades 2, 3, 4, and 6; (c) reduced the number of CWPT students in need of special education services by Grade 7; and (d) decreased the number of students who dropped out of school by the end of Grade 11 (Greenwood et al., 2002).", "More recently, CWPT research has been extended to include more secondary-age learners (Bowman-Perrott, 2009; Veerkamp et al., 2007) and to examine different forms of CWPT (i.e., cooperative versus competitive teams; Madrid et al., 2007).", "To date, there have been relatively few CWPT applications in secondary classes.", "Veerkamp et al.", "(2007) dem- onstrated that utilizing CWPT with an adapted lottery rein- forcement system improved the academic performance of three urban general education classes in which novels were used as the curriculum.", "Positive effects for CWPT at the secondary level were also seen in a study by Bowman-Perrott (2009).", "Here, the classroom teacher used CWPT in two alternative high school biology classes to teach vocabulary and factual science content to students with emotional and behavior dis- orders.", "In addition to improved academic performance and noticeable decreases in students\u2019 off-task and disruptive behav- iors, Bowman-Perrott noted that CWPT produced (a) more praise among pupils who typically had difficulty with positive social interactions, (b) increased levels of cooperation and better acceptance of adult feedback, and (c) generalized use of positive social behavior beyond the tutoring sessions.", "Madrid et al.", "(2007) examined the impact of an adapted version of CWPT on the spelling performance of 16 bilingual fourth-grade students.", "Drawing upon cultural theory that suggested that Hispanic children are more cooperative than Maheady and Gard 77 their Caucasian peers, Madrid created a \u201ccooperative\u201d form of CWPT and compared pupil performance to standard (i.e., between-team competition) CWPT and teacher-led instruc- tion.", "In the cooperative CWPT condition, teams with more tutoring points each day were asked to share their points with other team members.", "Whereas both versions of CWPT pro- duced better academic outcomes than teacher-led instruction, improvements were consistently higher under the cooperative CWPT format.", "This brief review of the CWPT research literature is intended to be illustrative rather than comprehensive; yet, it is possible to derive some general strengths and limitations.", "Regarding strengths, one must be impressed with both the number and consistency of CWPT findings.", "As noted, more than 35 empirical studies have been conducted on CWPT.", "The majority of these studies used single-case research designs that were implemented rigorously.", "Most studies, for example, targeted important academic and behavioral out- comes; measured the reliability with which outcome data were collected; documented that CWPT was used with a high degree of accuracy; and assessed the social acceptability of the intervention for teachers, pupils, and administrators.", "It is also noteworthy that similar outcomes were obtained across multiple research sites, in diverse content areas, and across a broad range of students and settings.", "The fact that so many different researchers working in so many different areas with so many different students got similar results speaks to the instructional power of CWPT.", "Obviously, there are also some noteworthy limitations in the existing database.", "First, more randomized control trials (i.e., between-group experiments) are needed to strengthen CWPT\u2019s external validity, or the extent to which findings can be generalized to other students, teachers, and settings.", "It would be interesting to conduct such investigations within the context of \u201cscaling up\u201d studies similar to that conducted by Buzhardt et al.", "(2007).", "Whereas there have been numerous smaller scale demonstrations of CWPT\u2019s effectiveness, it is important to examine the extent to which the intervention can be imple- mented on a buildingwide and districtwide basis.", "A third limi- tation is that CWPT has been used almost exclusively to develop basic academic skills and increase the acquisition and retention of factual knowledge.", "Applications with higher order academic outcomes would extend CWPT\u2019s utility.", "Finally, more long-term investigations that examine broader instruc- tional outcomes (e.g., performance on high-stakes assessments, progress through school) would be welcomed.", "In conclusion, CWPT is supported by a number of theo- retical perspectives (e.g., effective instruction, eco-behavior analysis, social learning) and a rich research base indicating its effectiveness for a variety of students in different educa- tional environments.", "In addition to describing how CWPT is used generally, also included are authentic teacher experiences based on real-world implementation of CWPT.", "It proved to be a powerful instructional strategy for improving the math fluency of students who had struggled for years in this area.", "The program was easy to implement, required few additional materials or time, and was very enjoyable for students.", "Declaration of Conflicting Interest The author(s) declared no conflicts of interest with respect to the authorship

implementation integrity greater or less between Year 1 and Year 2 (the latter in largely different classes with largely different teachers)?", "(3) To what extent were general classroom context indicators associated with the quality of implementation of individual technique, both within the observa- tional schedule?", "The last question stemmed from a desire to explore whether the individual tech- nique was best learned directly from specific training by the teacher, or indirectly by percolation from the overall classroom ethos with a good deal of pupil initiative and peer observation in

for each variable would be approximately three.", "The variables observed related directly to aspects of organisation that had formed part of the continuous professional development for teachers, and as such had face large-scale measures of reliability or validity validity.", "However, no independent were available.", "Observation of the quality of technique of the individual pair was focused on 11 variables which were recorded almost entirely as frequency counts (see Table 2).", "The expected result would be: about two for Reading, Checking, Pause for Think- Aloud and Making It Real, about four to six for Listening, Questioning and Praise, and about one and a half for Summarising and Generalising.", "These factors were aspects of the technique and as such had high face validity.",

vocabulary inter- vention included explicit instruction, multiple exposures to target words, and activities leading to deep processing of target word definitions.", "The embedded instruction condi- tion included providing participants with simple definitions of target words when those words appeared in the story.", "A sentence was then read a second time, and the target word was replaced with the definition.", "In the incidental exposure condition, neither target words nor their definitions were taught directly, but they were simply read when they appeared in the story.", "Results indicated that the extended instructional condition demonstrated greater target word learning than the other two conditions.", "The advantage of direct vocabulary instruction was also seen for students with disabilities.", "Jitendra, Edwards, Sacks, and Jacobson (2004) conducted a review of inter- vention studies that focused on vocabulary acquisition for students with learning disabilities.", "Based on their review, the authors suggested that when the purpose of vocabulary instruction is to introduce novel words and their definitions, practitioners should use instructional strategies that directly teach vocabulary.", "Some of the direct methods of instruction included use of mnemonic devices, direct instruction, activity- based methods, and computer-assisted instruction.", "Design- ing effective direct instruction of target vocabulary means ensuring the inclusion of instructional design principles, such as conspicuous strategies.", "Use of conspicuous strate- gies to teach vocabulary includes direct presentation of word definitions, modeling, and use of full and clear expla- nations of target vocabulary words (Coyne, Kame\u2019enui, & Carnine, 2007).", "Although direct teaching of vocabulary to students is important, it may be very challenging for the general edu- cation teacher to target this instruction and efficiently provide instruction across students with very different levels of vocabulary.", "One way to supplement incidental learning with targeted direct teaching and practice is through peer tutoring.", "Peer tutoring provides increased practice opportunities and immediate feedback to tutees.", "Rohrbeck, Ginsburg-Block, Fantuzzo, and Miller (2003) conducted a meta-analysis review of group comparison studies investigating the effects peer-assisted learning interventions within elementary school settings.", "Results indicated an effect size of .59 across 81 studies.", "Overall, based on the findings of the meta-analysis, the authors concluded that strong evidence exists for the effectiveness of peer-assisted learning interventions, especially with vulnerable students (e.g., minority students attending urban schools).", "There are few studies investigating the effects of peer tutoring on vocabulary gains.", "One study by Hughes and Fredrick (2006) used a multiple probes across behaviors design to investigate the effects of classwide reciprocal peer tutoring procedures combined with constant time delay on the vocabulary acquisition of sixth-grade students with learning disabilities.", "The researchers also examined the vocabulary acquisition of 16 students without learning dis- abilities who also participated in the intervention.", "Even though the peer tutoring was reciprocal, dyads had to be carefully planned so that a student with stronger academic skills was always paired with a student with weaker skills.", "The stronger student always assumed the role of tutor first during each session.", "All of the students with learning dis- abilities demonstrated mastery on two sets of vocabulary words (5 words per set).", "Two of the 3 students demonstrated mastery on a third set of words, and these students were able to maintain mastery for all 15 target words for at least 7 weeks following intervention.", "For the students without learning disabilities, high rates of mastery were demon- strated and maintained for at least 7 weeks.", "Reciprocal peer tutoring has several advantages (e.g., the items address the needs of both students, there is no stratification of roles) but may be difficult to arrange in such a way that students provide sufficient support to each other to learn the content.", "In the majority of studies con- ducted using peer tutoring as an intervention, students had to be carefully paired because the tutor needed to be able to provide correct modeling and appropriate feedback to the tutee.", "A few studies have been conducted to address the challenge of providing the essential information to a nai\u0308ve tutor, allowing for correct modeling and feedback (Butler, 1999; Heward, Heron, & Cooke, 1982; Van Norman & Wood, 2008).", "Heward

investigating the effectiveness of an intervention designed to target vocabu- lary acquisition and further examining the use of audio prompting as a support to nai\u0308ve tutors within a recip- rocal

of peer tutoring with audio prompting to multiple exposures of target words in passages on the number of vocabulary words correctly placed in context and (b) student opinions regarding treatment acceptability of the intervention.", "Method Participants Participants were eight students who had been identified by the classroom teacher as struggling in reading and demonstrated below-average performance on classroom assessments.", "Students included four girls and four boys, ages 9 to 11 years old.", "Of the eight students, one was identi- fied as having a specific learning disability in reading only; two were identified as having specific learning disabilities in reading and writing; one was identified as having spe- cific learning disabilities in reading, writing, and math; and one was identified as having a mild intellectual disability.", "The remaining three students were identified by the class- room teacher as needing support in the area of reading.", "All students received core, general education reading instruc- tion in the same fourth-grade inclusion classroom cotaught by a general education teacher and a special education teacher (fourth author).", "Students were teamed together in tutoring pairs based on academic and behavioral characteristics.", "For example, a student with attention difficulties was paired with a student who could keep the tutoring pair

disabilities represented 9.8% of the school population.", "Training, pretests, posttests, and completion of social validity questionnaires took place in a private office within the school.", "Core reading instruction took place within a fourth-grade general education classroom.", "Peer tutoring was conducted outside the classroom in the hallway for two pairs, and two pairs worked in a separate classroom used by teachers providing supplemental instruction.", "These settings were chosen because, as is true in many overpopulated schools, small-group instruction often takes place in areas outside of the classroom.", "Peer tutoring took place prior to the beginning of the academic school day.", "While the students participating in the study completed the intervention procedures, the other stu- dents in the classroom completed nonacademic morning activities to prepare for the day (e.g., unpacking book bags, sharpening pencils, recording homework assignments).", "Researchers The first and fourth authors implemented the study proce- dures at the school.", "At the time of the study, they were doctoral students in special education at a university in the southeastern United States.", "The first author was employed as a school psychologist, working full-time at the school where the study was conducted.", "The fourth author was employed as the special education teacher in

for use over the course of the study.", "Pretests were printed on paper and consisted of a word bank at the top of the page containing 20 story words plus 4 distracter, nonstory words and 20 fill-in-the-blank sentences.", "An example of a fill-in-the-blank sentence from the pretest is, \u201cShe always kept her desk ______ so that she could find everything she needed during class.\u201d The correct answer, 348 Remedial and Special Education 32(4) \u201ctidy,\u201d would be in the word bank.", "The 20 story words were selected from each Open Court lesson that would be taught during the next week.", "To avoid introducing a confounding variable, the 20 story words did not include any that were identified for explicit vocabulary instruction in Open Court materials.", "Twelve target words were selected from the story words missed on the pretests.", "These 12 words were identi- fied as target words, with 6 randomly assigned to the incidental learning condition and 6 words assigned to the peer tutoring condition.", "Posttests.", "Posttests followed the same format as the pretests (i.e., word bank plus distracters, fill-in-the-blank sentences).", "Posttests included 12 target words in the word bank along with 3 distractors and 12 fill-in-the-blank sentences.", "VoicePods.", "VoicePods (Attainment Company Inc., 2006) were used to facilitate peer tutoring and were purchased for approximately $60.00 each.", "The VoicePod is a portable digital recording and playback system that includes multi- ple, reusable cards.", "Each card is covered with a clear plastic sleeve that can be lifted to insert a paper square displaying text.", "In addition, each card has an identification/activation strip across the bottom, and when that strip is inserted into the pod, it accesses a recording of up to 10 s that can be coordinated with the visual prompt on the card.", "The record- ings are activated by the push of a button.", "The VoicePod was selected because it was transportable, easily adapted, and cost efficient.", "Eight VoicePod cards were used for each target word.", "The text for each card was printed from a computer and then put into each sleeve.", "The text for the eight cards included the following information for each vocabulary word (a) the vocab- ulary word, (b) the definition or synonym of the vocabulary word, (c) a sentence using the vocabulary word, (d) an iden- tical sentence using the definition or synonym in place of the vocabulary word, (e) a different sentence using the vocabu- lary word, (f) an identical sentence using the definition or synonym in place of the vocabulary word, (g) two sentences (labeled \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d) containing blanks for one word, and (h) the correct sentence (a or b) from the previous card con- taining the vocabulary word.", "Measures Dependent variable.", "The dependent variable was the number of target vocabulary words correctly selected for sentences on the posttests.", "The number of words correctly selected from the incidental condition was compared to the number of words correctly selected from the incidental plus peer tutoring condi- tion.", "Scores were entered into a database that was used to construct a graphical representation of the data.", "Interscorer reliability.", "A second observer scored 40% of the posttests administered to each child.", "An agreement was counted if both the experimenter and the second observer marked the same item as correct or the same item as incor- rect.", "A disagreement was counted if the second observer\u2019s markings differed from those of the experimenter.", "Inter- scorer reliability was calculated by dividing the number of agreements by the number of agreements plus disagree- ments and multiplying by 100.", "Reliability of scoring across student pairs was 100%.", "Experimental Design A simultaneous treatments design (Tawney & Gast, 1984) was used to compare the effects of incidental learning of vocabulary words through classroom reading instruction to a combination of incidental learning supplemented with peer tutoring.", "In a simultaneous treatments design, the two conditions are presented concurrently; however, the tasks for each condition are discrete (e.g., different vocabulary words).", "If there is a clear separation in the data paths from the probes in each condition, confidence increases that one condition had a greater effect than the other.", "In the present study, vocabulary learned through incidental learning from classroom reading activities was graphed and compared to incidental learning of vocabulary plus peer tutoring with audio prompting.", "Procedures Pretesting and posttesting.", "A pretest was administered prior to each new instructional reading lesson, and posttests were administered at the conclusion of lessons related to each story, or approximately every 5 days.", "Pretests and posttests were administered in the same way.", "Students were given the test, and the experimenter read aloud each word in the word bank.", "The experimenter then read aloud each fill- in-the-blank sentence.", "Words and sentences were repeated at the students\u2019 request.", "As each sentence was read, the stu- dents wrote the numeral corresponding to the word in the word bank they thought best completed the sentence.", "Tests were read aloud to standardize administration procedures and to ensure that deficits in decoding were not preventing the accurate measurement of vocabulary knowledge.", "Incidental learning.", "The incidental learning condition included student exposure to target words during core read- ing instruction from Open Court Reading (Bereiter et al., 2000).", "Each Open Court lesson (Bereiter et al., 2000) was presented during five 40-minute whole-group sessions.", "The general and special education teachers conducted the ses- sions.", "Students were given repeated opportunities to come in contact with target words (i.e., read aloud, read indepen- dently) ranging from 2 to 14 times (M = 7.8) across the five sessions (i.e., per lesson).", "For example, timber was a target word from Pretest 6, and students had eight

session con- ducted by both researchers.", "Tutoring pairs remained constant throughout the study.", "Specifically, students were taught appropriate tutoring behaviors as well as how to give feed- back to each other.", "All students received step-by-step instructions for both roles (tutor and tutee) because each stu- dent spent an equal amount of time in each role.", "Students first watched a demonstration of the procedures conducted by the researchers and then were given an opportunity to practice the tutoring procedure with a researcher.", "The tutoring pairs then continued to practice the tutoring procedures until they could independently complete all steps within the roles of both tutor and tutee.", "Practice continued until mastery (i.e., 100% on treatment fidelity checklist) was reached.", "During the first four tutoring sessions, the experimenters observed the students and gave feedback and correction when needed.", "A booster training session was provided to one tutoring pair that consistently left out one of the tutoring steps.", "Peer tutoring.", "Peer tutoring included all of the steps of the incidental learning condition with the addition of reciprocal peer tutoring.", "VoicePods (Attainment Company Inc., 2006) were used to facilitate peer tutoring.", "Each pair of students was provided one VoicePod and six sets of eight cards as described earlier in the Materials section.", "Tutors used a model-lead-test, feedback strategy (i.e., demonstration, pair practice, independent tutee practice, feedback) to present the words and definitions to the tutees.", "At any time, if the tutee\u2019s response was correct, the tutor provided praise (e.g., \u201cfantastic,\u201d \u201cgreat job\u201d).", "If the tutee was incorrect, the tutor said, \u201clisten again,\u201d and the steps were repeated.", "Tutoring pairs participated in four tutoring sessions per week during which they practiced all six sets of vocabulary words.", "When procedural fidelity data were collected, tutoring sessions were timed.", "Sessions typically lasted 14 to 17 minutes and were not directly monitored unless researchers were col- lecting procedural fidelity data.", "Table

"When correct, the students were able to gain sufficient facility with the target words that they were able to place them in novel contexts.", "In addition, the word bank consisted of 15 choices in contrast to studies that use maze procedures with only 3 choices, diminishing the likelihood that guessing accounted for correct selections.", "The tutoring procedures used in this study were explicit (i.e., students were given the definition) and included mul- tiple opportunities to hear and practice saying the definition as well as apply the word to context, a level of practice dif- ficult to

(Coyne et al., 2007; Jitendra et al., 2004), especially for at-risk students who are less likely to learn new word meanings through incidental exposure (Coyne et al., 2004; Robbins & Ehri, 1994).", "The results of this study support previous research on the effectiveness of peer tutoring (Rohrbeck et al., 2003) and the use of peer tutoring to teach word meanings (Hughes & Fredrick, 2006).", "Teachers are challenged to find ways of reaching the diverse needs of students in ways that are effi- cient and feasible with available resources.", "The gains made with the procedures used in the study are meaningful con- sidering the tutoring sessions were a short, supplemental activity that did not require teacher monitoring.", "This study demonstrated a tutoring strategy that worked within the typical constraints placed on classroom teachers (e.g., no additional personnel, minimal budget).", "By using a peer tutoring procedure, teachers are able to extend targeted instruction to more students.", "In addition, academic gains were realized for both partners, adding to literature on reciprocal peer tutoring (e.g., Hughes & Fredrick, 2006; Mastropieri et al., 2001; Van Norman & Wood, 2008).", "In addition, research has demonstrated the effectiveness of peer or parent tutoring with low-tech audio prompting to support a nai\u0308ve tutor and improve limited-English-proficient

technology support in tutoring to another device, the VoicePod.", "Limitations and Future Research One limitation of this study related to participant absentee- ism.", "Several times throughout the intervention, a participant was absent.", "However, this posed a problem for only one tutoring pair on one set of words because they were not able to participate in a minimum of three tutoring sessions nec- essary to practice all of the words on the posttest representing the tutoring condition.", "A second limitation is that the posttests required students to make a selection-type response (i.e., matching the vocab- ulary word to an appropriate sentence) rather than a recall-type response (writing the vocabulary word in the blank space of an appropriate sentence).", "If the goal of vocabulary instruction is to increase expressive use of the target word, a different measure would be important.", "A more conservative measure would be to eliminate the word bank and use a cloze procedure in which students supply the target word to fill in a blank within a context-rich sen- tence.", "Although this measure has many scoring challenges (e.g., interpreting student spelling, more lengthy testing, variability induced by student recall), it might demonstrate a greater difference between explicit instruction through peer tutoring and incidental exposure.", "In the present study, one of the classroom teachers noted that some of the participants began using learned vocabu- lary words from tutoring in expressive writing assignments.", "A measure that could capture students\u2019 expressive use of vocabulary would also strengthen future research.", "Future studies could examine various easy-to-use tech- nology supports (e.g., computer slideshow software; Wood et al., 2007) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of peer tutoring.", "Moving to computer-based support has the advantage of easy development, easy storage, detailed graphics, and very clear audio prompts.", "Studies that dem- onstrate the effectiveness of peer tutoring using various technologies is advantageous because the constraints of classroom settings vary.", "For example, the VoicePod is highly transportable, so in classrooms where there is lim- ited access to computers or if tutoring pairs need to work outside the classroom, this technology would be beneficial.", "As new technologies emerge, researchers should continue to explore these as support mechanisms for tutors.", "This study included fourth graders identified as strug- gling readers or having high-incidence disabilities.", "More research across a range of student ages, abilities, and content Mackiewicz et al.", "353 areas (e.g., phonemic awareness, writing skills, math prob- lem solving) is needed.", "Butler (1999) found that peer tutoring was an effective strategy for teaching sight words to students with mild to moderate disabilities, and Kamps, Barbetta, Leonard, and Delquadri (1994) found peer tutor- ing to be an effective strategy for students with autism.", "Peer tutoring-related research has also been conducted with stu- dents with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities.", "Peer tutors varied from students placed in advanced classes (Collins, Branson, & Hall, 1995) to students with mild intel- lectual disabilities (Agran, Fodor-Davis, Moore, & Martella, 1992).", "Future research can investigate the benefits of peer tutoring with audio prompting for students with moderate intellectual disabilities and determine if this method pro- vides the needed support for tutoring pairs to successfully teach each other without needing a tutor who already knows the material.", "Implications for Practice Peer tutoring with audio prompting has advantages for use in educational settings.", "First, peer tutoring can supplement teacher-led instruction and provide students with repeated practice on new content.", "A teacher could set up peer tutor- ing stations, and students could work at the stations while not participating in whole-class or small-group instruction.", "During tutoring, students can make several active, curriculum- related responses in a short amount of time (Heward, 1994), thus receiving the practice needed to master new skills.", "Second, an audio prompting device allows tutors to give immediate and accurate feedback to tutees even if the tutors are nai\u0308ve to the material (Van Norman & Wood, 2008; Wood et al., 2007).", "Even though prerecorded audio prompts and feedback are embedded into the materials, the tutor\u2019s presence is still necessary.", "The tutor\u2019s presence and feed- back can ensure that the tutee will respond to each task, unlike an independent activity in which the student might passively look at or skip through the materials.", "Peer tutoring has enhanced academic achievement for struggling students (Rohrbeck et al., 2003).", "This study sup- ports and extends previous studies that combined technology and peer tutoring (Cooke et al., 2009; Van Norman & Wood, 2008) and shows that peer tutoring with audio prompting can be a valuable supplement to incidental exposure to vocabulary through reading.",

nitive regulation.", "The present study examines the impact of reciprocal peer tutoring (RPT) on university students\u2019 metacognitive regulation.", "Unlike most other research, it does not focus exclu- sively on a particular regulation skill (e.g.", "monitoring), but takes an integrative perspective when assessing students\u2019 metacognitive regulation.", "It more specifically investigates changes in students\u2019 metacognitive orientation, planning, monitoring, and evaluation after participation in RPT.", "By enhancing our understanding of the differential impact of RPT on students\u2019 adoption of regulation skills, the present study offers direct cues to optimally foster students\u2019 regulation through RPT.", "Theoretical framework Metacognitive regulation Metacognition refers to both the awareness and active control students have over their cognitive activities when engaged in learning or academic problem-solving (Brown 1987; Pintrich 2004).", "The first component, metacognitive knowledge, concerns insights of stu- dents about themselves as learners, insight into learning strategies, and insight into the usefulness of these strategies within specific learning conditions (Pintrich 2004; Zim- merman and Schunk 2011).", "The second component, metacognitive regulation, refers to self-regulatory skills and strategies adopted by students to actively control and coordinate their learning and performance (Greene and Azevedo 2009; Meijer et al.", "2006).", "The focus of the present study is on this second component of metacognition.", "We distinguish ori- enting, planning, monitoring, and evaluating as key regulation skills (Brown 1987; Veenman et al.", "1997), which unfold over weakly sequenced and recursive problem-solving phases (Greene and Azevedo 2009; Winne and Hadwin 1998).", "When orienting, students engage in task analysis to get acquainted with learning objectives or task demands (Pintrich 2004).", "This can result in awareness of task perceptions or prior knowledge activation (Meijer et al.", "2006; Winne and Hadwin 1998).", "Planning encompasses selecting and sequencing problem-solving strategies, allocating resources, and developing action plans (Greene and Azevedo 2009; Meijer et al.", "2006); either at the onset or during task execution (e.g.", "after a subtask).", "Monitoring involves the online quality control of problem-solving, aimed at identifying inconsistencies and optimising task execution (Meijer et al.", "2006; Moos and Azevedo 2009).", "Comprehension monitoring refers to control activities focusing on the correctness of one\u2019s understanding (Pintrich 2004; Veenman et al.", "1997), whereas monitoring of progress focuses on the adequateness of problem-solving strategies or the quality of students\u2019 progress (Greene and Azevedo 2009; Moos and Azevedo 2009).", "Finally, evaluation involves learners\u2019 self-judgement upon completion of problem-solving (Veenman et al.", "2005).", "This can be directed at both learning outcomes and the learning process (Meijer et al.", "2006).", "Low-level versus deep-level metacognitive regulation The present study distinguishes low-level and deep-level metacognitive regulation, intro- ducing a more in-depth operationalisation.", "Low-level orientation is solely directed at exploring task demands, whereas deep-level orientation aims at processing task demands and activating prior knowledge (Veenman et al.", "2005).", "Low-level planning implies the 123 High Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486 471 development of a single problem-solving plan, whereas deep-level planning involves selecting a plan after considering various problem-solving alternatives (Meijer et al.", "2006; Veenman et al.", "1997).", "When students check their progress or the comprehensiveness of their understanding, they engage in low-level monitoring.", "Reflective comments on the quality of their perceived progress or elaborative, thought-provoking reflections imply deep-level monitoring (Moos and Azevedo 2009).", "Correspondingly, low-level evaluation involves checking and commenting on either learning outcomes or process factors, whereas deep-level evaluation implies reflective judgements on both (Veenman et al.", "2005).", "Optimising metacognitive regulation through peer tutoring Fostering metacognitive regulation requires direct observation of explicitly modelled metacognitive behaviour, along with explanations about regulation skills (Schunk and Zimmerman 2007; Volet et al.", "2009).", "Students should further be challenged to internalise the modelled behaviour at the individual level, by practising and subsequently reflecting upon a variety of self-regulatory strategies.", "Additionally, learners should be encouraged to discuss and control their learning, refining their metacognitive regulation (Schunk and Zimmerman 2007).", "Current research centres on modelling by peers during collaborative learning (Volet et al.", "2009).", "During collaborative learning, students discuss meaning and compare their thinking with peers, requiring both regulation of their own cognition and control of how peers learn (Volet et al.", "2009).", "Despite growing consensus on the meta- cognitive learning opportunities during collaborative learning, empirical evidence on its differential influence on students\u2019 adoption of specific regulation skills is limited.", "The present study aims to enhance our understanding of the metacognitive potential of col- laborative learning, by studying the specific impact of reciprocal peer tutoring on uni- versity students\u2019 use of orientation, planning, monitoring, and evaluation.", "Peer tutoring is characterised by active academic helping and supporting between peers in small groups or student pairs (Falchikov 2001; Topping 1996).", "One peer, the tutor, is expected to take a direct pedagogical responsibility by creating learning opportunities through questioning, clarifying, and scaffolding (Chi et al.", "2001).", "The students being cognitively challenged by this peer tutor are called tutees.", "Reciprocal peer tutoring (RPT) is characterised by the structured exchange of the tutor role among peers in the PT groups/ pairs (Topping 1996).", "Although the available research illustrates that peer tutoring chal- lenges students\u2019 metacognitive regulation and particularly promotes their adoption of monitoring (e.g.", "King 1997; Roscoe and Chi 2008), possible effects on other regulation skills are underexposed.", "Aim of the study and research hypotheses The present study aims to study the changes in university students\u2019 adoption of meta- cognitive regulation skills after participation in RPT.", "Since literature provides evidence for metacognitive learning opportunities within collaborative learning, we hypothesise that RPT will have a positive impact on students\u2019 use of metacognitive regulation skills (hypothesis 1).", "During tutoring, conceptual discussions can take place at different levels of social interaction: the individual, dyadic, and group level (Volet et al.", "2009).", "Conse- quently, students experience the need to metacognitively regulate their own, each other\u2019s, or the group\u2019s cognition, increasing chances for metacognitive engagement.", "Because more 123 472 High Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486 regulatory control often results in the use of profound metacognitive strategies (Chin and Brown 2000; Greene and Azevedo 2009), we additionally hypothesise that RPT will promote students\u2019 involvement in deep-level metacognitive regulation (hypothesis 2).", "Method Design A quasi-experimental pretest\u2013posttest design was adopted, involving an experimental and two control groups.", "Experimental students participated in the RPT intervention during a complete semester.", "Both at the start (October) and the end (December) of the semester, the regulation skills of individual participants (n = 97) were assessed.", "Participants and setting The study was conducted in a naturalistic university setting.", "The experimental group (EG) consisted of the complete population of 64 first-year students, Educational Sciences, who already obtained a professional bachelor degree (12.5 % males and 87.5 % females).1 This gender distribution is representative for the Educational Sciences students population in Flanders (Belgium).", "Unlike other studies (e.g.", "Cheng and Ku 2009; Duran and Monereo 2005), the present study did not aim to compare RPT with a different type of student- activating learning (e.g.", "fixed peer tutoring, self-explaining).", "Therefore, we preferred not to assign students of the Educational Sciences programme with a professional bachelor degree to either an experimental or control treatment, due to ethical reasons.", "Such a design would imply students being deprived from the benefits of peer-assisted learning, inherent to RPT.", "Alternatively, we involved two control groups.", "The first (CG1) consisted of 24 freshmen in the Educational Sciences programme (12.5 % males and 87.5 % females).", "Despite differences in participants\u2019 age and prior experience in higher education, these students are enrolled in the same curriculum as EG students.", "This curriculum aims at introducing students into the basic theoretical frameworks of Educational Sciences and consists of general social sciences courses, specialised pedagogical courses, and method- ology courses.", "The second control group (CG2) consisted of 22 first-year students in the Social Welfare Studies programme of the same faculty, who also attained a professional bachelor degree (14.3 % males and 85.7 % females).", "Although these students are enrolled in a somewhat different curriculum, their background and prior experience in higher education is comparable to EG students.", "CG2 students\u2019 curriculum aims at introducing students into the theoretical frameworks of Social Welfare Studies and consists of general pedagogical courses, specialised courses on Social Welfare Studies, and methodology courses.", "The didactical approach of these courses is comparable to the curriculum of EG and CG1 students: a dominance of theoretical lectures is alternated with group work, which focuses on writing a theoretical paper with a small group of students.", "During the research period, students from both control groups attended regular curriculum activities as part of their academic training.", "They were not involved in tutoring, neither in any comparable 1 Although all 64 RPT students participated in the pretest, not all of them attended the posttest assessment.", "Additionally, the tape recordings of some RPT students demonstrated technical problems.", "Therefore, the data of 13 EG students were excluded from the analysis.", "123 Intervention RPT assignments Training High Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486 473 collaborative learning approach, encompassing systematic conceptual discussions among students in a face-to-face setting.", "interaction and EG students were randomly assigned to eleven RPT groups.", "The RPT programme was a formal component of the 5-credit course \u2018\u2018Instructional Sciences\u2019\u2019 (of which the theoretical lectures were part of both EG and CG1 students\u2019 curriculum).", "Informed consent was obtained from all participants in the study.", "The RPT intervention consisted of eight successive face-to-face sessions (each taking 2 h), in which students tutored each other in small and stable groups of six.", "The tutor role was changed at each session.", "As a manipulation check, all RPT groups were observed weekly, to control whether students enacted their roles adequately.", "During each session, students worked on authentic, open-ended group assignments (De Backer et al.", "2012).", "Each assignment comprised of an outline of learning objectives to guide peers\u2019 discussions to central course-related topics; a subtask aimed at getting familiar with the theme-specific terminology; and a subtask in which students applied theoretical notions to realistic instructional cases.", "All EG students participated in a compulsory tutor training 1 week before the onset of the RPT intervention, focussing on tutor responsibilities and generic tutoring skills (i.e.", "establishing a safe learning climate, managing peer interactions, questioning, explaining, scaffolding, and providing feedback) (Chi et al.", "2001; King 1997).", "The training used videotaped examples of good and bad practices, which were discussed in depth, role plays in which students experienced multiple tutor responsibilities and received feedback on their tutoring approach, and the in-depth analysis of authentic case studies focusing on specific tutor competences.", "The outlines of the training were presented in a manual pro- vided to all EG students.", "Tutor guide Interim support To prepare themselves for the tutor role, tutoring students received a session-specific \u2018\u2018tutor guide\u2019\u2019 1 week in advance.", "This offered additional information about the theoretical learning content to focus upon in the RPT session and assured a difference in tutors\u2019 and tutees\u2019 domain-specific knowledge (Topping 1996).", "Although the theoretical content of the guide differed across sessions, its structure and design were identical throughout the RPT intervention.", "In addition to offering theoretical knowledge, the guide exemplified a step- wise problem-solving approach (De Backer et al.", "2012).", "An interim supervision session and two-weekly feedback sessions were organised, to provide tutor support (Falchikov 2001).", "The supervision was set up in small groups of 123 474 High Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486 twelve students and directed by a university staff member, who encouraged students to reflect on the adequacy of their tutor/tutee behaviour.", "Additionally, the staff member provided group-specific feedback once every 2 weeks.", "Instruments Task Assessment of students\u2019 metacognitive regulation was based on think-aloud protocol analysis.", "At the start and the end of the research, all participants individually performed an academic task that was videotaped.", "Participants were instructed to solve the task and to verbalise their problem-solving, resulting in verbal protocols (Greene et al.", "2011).", "The individual think-aloud task comprised of a theoretical text and a real-life case relevant to the course \u2018\u2018Instructional Sciences\u2019\u2019 (i.e.", "topic \u2018\u2018evaluation\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018social inequity in education\u2019\u2019 at pretest and posttest, respectively).", "Students solved thought-provoking questions about the text.", "In case students stopped verbalising during task performance, they were prompted by the assessor to continue thinking aloud.", "Apart from a difference in the central topic, all aspects of the think-aloud task and the assessment procedure were identical at pretest and posttest.", "Both tasks provided a challenging yet comprehensible text, comprised of multiple parts, and had to be executed during the mild time constraint of 30 min (Greene et al.", "2011).", "Coding instrument To analyse students\u2019 verbal protocols, we developed a literature-based coding instrument, representing a multi-layered model of metacognitive regulation (De Backer et al.", "2012).", "Orientation, planning, monitoring, and evaluation are adopted as the main coding cate- gories and further specified with sub-coding categories (i.e.", "task analysis, content orien- tation, planning in advance, interim planning, comprehension monitoring, monitoring of progress, evaluation of learning outcomes, and evaluation of the learning process).", "Additionally, a dimension on the low-/deep-level approach is included.", "Coding strategy The verbal protocols of all students were transcribed verbatim and coded by two inde- pendent and trained coders.", "They double coded 25 % of the protocols to determine interrater reliability.", "Cohen\u2019s kappa (j = 0.78) indicates high overall interrater reliability and good agreement beyond chance for the four main coding categories (jorientation = 0.89, jplanning = 0.86, jmonitoring = 0.82, and jevaluation = 0.89).", "The coding procedure followed subsequent phases and focused exclusively on students\u2019 verbalised behaviour.", "Each verbal protocol was initially segmented according to changes in the verbalisation focus, which formed the boundaries of substantial \u2018\u2018episodes\u2019\u2019 (Chi et al.", "2001).", "An episode is con- ceptualised as a brief segment of the overall verbal protocol that was centred around one particular action.", "After segmentation, each episode received a general code, indicating whether it concerned a metacognitive, task-executive, or off-task episode.", "Second, meta- cognitive episodes were selected for more detailed \u2018\u2018statement coding\u2019\u2019 (Roscoe and Chi 2008).", "A statement refers to a single thematically consistent verbalisation of a single 123 High Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486 475 metacognitive action.", "Next, the identified metacognitive statements were coded by means of the developed coding instrument.", "Every statement received a general code (indicating the regulation skill it addressed) and a more differentiated code (referring to the concre- tised regulation strategies situated in the subcategories of the coding instrument).", "Addi- tionally, the approach (low level /deep level) to the identified metacognitive statements was coded.", "Table 1 exemplifies the coding strategy.", "Data analysis First, the frequency of occurrence of all regulation skills and strategies, and of low-/deep- level approaches, was calculated for each protocol per participant.", "The frequency of occurrence of regulation skills and approaches in individual students\u2019 protocols was aggregated for each research condition.", "These frequencies per condition were used for analysis purposes.", "Second, pre-analysis investigations were conducted to check both the assumption of normally distributed data (i.e.", "by means of Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov tests) and the assumption of homogeneity of variance (i.e.", "by means of Levene\u2019s tests).", "Since the results revealed that neither assumption was violated, parametric analyses (i.e.", "t tests) were performed to examine the significance of differences in the adoption of metacognitive regulation between conditions and measurement occasions.", "Third, independent samples t tests were conducted (i.e.", "comparing EG with CG1, EG with CG2, and CG1 with CG2, respectively) to assure that the metacognitive regulation of students in the three conditions was comparable at pretest.", "Fourth, the frequency of occurrence of regulation skills and approaches at pretest and posttest was compared by means of paired samples t tests, to study the impact of RPT on students\u2019 use of metacognitive skills (hypothesis 1) and on their deep-level regulation approach (hypothesis 2).", "Significant differences in students\u2019 metacognitive regulation at pretest and posttest were tested for each condition separately (see Tables 3, 4, 5).", "Cohen\u2019s d is reported as a measure of effect size of significant differences which were identified in students\u2019 adoption of regulation skills and a deep-level regulation approach.", "The significance level was 0.05 for all analyses.", "Results Descriptive analysis on students\u2019 metacognitive regulation Table 2 demonstrates a dominant involvement of all students in metacognitive monitoring, both at pretest and posttest, whereas their adoption of orientation, planning, and evaluation is rather limited, especially at pretest.", "Results moreover reveal a clear pretest-to-posttest change towards more frequent use for the majority of metacognitive strategies by EG students.", "For some metacognitive behaviour, this trend is markedly smaller in both control groups (e.g.", "comprehension monitoring, evaluation of learning outcomes), while for other metacognitive strategies this positive evolution cannot be discerned at all (e.g.", "orientation, monitoring of progress).", "In contrast, the planning behaviour of students appears to evolve similarly for all research groups.", "Results further reveal students\u2019 limited attention to evaluation of the learning process, deep-level monitoring of progress, deep-level planning, and taking into account task perceptions.", "This is observed at pretest and posttest, in all conditions.2 2 Metacognitive regulation strategies with very low frequency of occurrence (\\1 % in Table 2)

and orientation, compared to traditional teaching approaches.", "A sig- nificant impact on students\u2019 planning behaviour could, however, not be distinguished, not for EG students neither for the control conditions.", "This might be due to the design of the think-aloud task, for the latter partially determines the outcomes of protocol analysis (Greene et al.", "2011).", "Since students were expected to solve three thought-provoking questions on a well-structured academic task, the opportunities to plan were probably scarce.", "Additionally, students might not have felt the need to sequence problem-solving steps within the available time framework.", "It should further be noted that the developed coding instrument might not have been sensitive enough to capture students\u2019 planning appropriately.", "Future research should aim to conceptualise metacognitive planning in a more specific way in order to optimise its assessment.", "RPT appeared to have a critical impact on students\u2019 application of comprehension monitoring.", "During RPT, students were challenged to approach the learning content crit- ically and to negotiate its meaning, resulting in self-questioning (Roscoe and Chi 2008).", "It seems plausible to assume that a semester-long experience in this cognitively challenging RPT environment prompted students to internalise this comprehension monitoring behaviour.", "It should be noted, however, that control students also checked their under- standing more often at posttest.", "Consequently, students\u2019 increased involvement in com- prehension monitoring might be partially attributed to their experienced need for self- regulation in higher education (Nota et al.", "2004).", "During their first semester at university, all students were presumably faced with the demands for elaborative thinking and self- control of one\u2019s understanding, resulting in the adoption of monitoring strategies.", "Nev- ertheless, our findings demonstrated that EG students showed a significant larger adoption of monitoring strategies as compared to students in control conditions, implying an added value of RPT.", "Our findings further revealed increased monitoring of progress and more evaluative comments on learning outcomes for EG students.", "In contrast, both control groups did increase their metacognitive reflection and evaluation, not during the course of not problem-solving (i.e.", "monitoring their progress), neither upon completing it (i.e.", "metacognitive evaluation).", "These findings suggest that RPT is a promising approach when aiming to advance students\u2019 evaluative reflections.", "It can be assumed that the key elements of PT (i.e.", "asking and answering thought-provoking questions, providing knowledge-building explanations, scaffolding, giving feedback.)", "directly fostered stu- dents\u2019 self-reflections and evaluative insights (Chi et al.", "2001; Roscoe and Chi 2008).", "Additionally, the design of the RPT learning materials might have promoted students\u2019 evaluative engagements, for the assignments and weekly tutor guides systematically outlined learning objectives, which might have served as an evaluative tool (Zimmer- man and Schunk 2011).", "Given EG students\u2019 increased adoption of certain metacognitive regulation strategies, we recommend higher education instructors to implement RPT when aiming to promote university students\u2019 metacognitive regulation.", "The results more specifically revealed that training students to tutor each other stimulates them to start monitoring their learning more frequently.", "Additionally, the present study suggests that well-structured and goal-oriented group assignments have potential to elicit particular evaluation strategies (albeit less pronounced compared to evoking monitoring acts).", "Consequently, organising RPT requires educators to carefully design learning materials which can encourage students in regulating their learning.", "123 High Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486 483 Impact of RPT on students\u2019 deep-level regulation approach Notwithstanding students\u2019 dominant use of low-level regulation, at pretest and posttest, our findings revealed significant effects of RPT on students\u2019 deep-level metacognitive regu- lation.", "Given that none of the control groups demonstrated significant pretest-to-posttest changes towards a deep-level regulation approach for none of the key regulation skills, the above-mentioned result implies that RPT is more beneficiary to enhance students\u2019 engagement in deep-level regulation, compared to traditional teaching approaches.", "Our findings more specifically demonstrated that EG students outperformed control students in the adoption of deep-level comprehension monitoring.", "Since tutors were trained to promote tutees\u2019 profound reflective thinking by asking critical questions, providing cognitive scaffolds, and giving knowledge-building explanations, it could be assumed that RPT participants observed and eventually internalised these strategies, modelled by their tutors.", "EG students additionally revealed an increased use of deep-level task analysis, profound monitoring of progress, and deep-level evaluation of learning outcomes.", "It should be noted, however, the frequency of occurrence of these deep-level regulation strategies remained low.", "Students\u2019 rather limited involvement in deep-level regulation might be explained by both the need for explicit metacognitive prompts and more extensive opportunities to practise regulation skills (Schunk and Zimmerman 2007).", "Since orienta- tion and evaluation can only be employed before and upon completion of task execution, respectively, their frequency of occurrence might have been too limited for students to evolve towards frequent deep-level orientation and evaluation.", "that Based on our results, we advise higher education instructors to implement long-lasting RPT interventions, allowing students the time they need to evolve towards more frequent practice with different deep-level regulation strategies.", "This practice could increase the chances of students starting to internalise a deep-level approach when regulating their learning.", "Additionally, it might be advisable to include explicit scaffolds in the RPT learning materials, which can directly prompt students\u2019 deep-level regulation during all phases of problem-solving.", "Such scaffolds might particularly be relevant for evoking orientation, evaluation, and planning, given that these regulation skills remained rather low-level in the current RPT intervention, which was characterised by open-ended RPT assignments, not directing students\u2019 regulation.", "Prompting students\u2019 deep-level regulation approach in future research could enhance their regulative engagement in this respect, allowing students to refine and spontaneously adopt a deep-level approach when applying diverse regulation skills.", "Limitations and recommendations for future research Since the present study was conducted in a naturalistic university setting, it was, due to ethical reasons, preferable not to randomly assign students from the same class group to either the experimental or control condition.", "Although two control groups were involved, these were not completely comparable due to differences in participants\u2019 background or their university curriculum.", "Consequently, caution is needed when interpreting the sig- nificant changes in students\u2019 metacognitive regulation.", "Alternative explanations for EG students\u2019 increased regulation can be found in both students\u2019 cognitive gains and the emphasis on self-regulation in the course \u2018\u2018Instructional Sciences\u2019\u2019.", "Empirical research demonstrated that students\u2019 metacognitive regulation is correlated to their cognitive actions and performance (Greene and Azevedo 2009; Zimmerman and Schunk 2011).", "Students with higher levels of general and domain-specific knowledge are expected to demonstrate a 123 484 High Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486 larger involvement in regulation, often resulting in better performance.", "Moreover, high levels of knowledge and academic experience are assumed to positively influence the quality of learners\u2019 metacognitive skills (Chin and Brown 2000).", "This study was set up in relation to the course \u2018\u2018Instructional Sciences\u2019\u2019 introducing students in theories about learning and instruction, including self-regulation.", "The particular course context might have enhanced EG students\u2019 problem-solving awareness, resulting in a theory-driven execution of the think-aloud task.", "It should be noted, however, that metacognitive gains based on students\u2019 knowledge of \u2018\u2018Instructional Sciences\u2019\u2019 could equally be expected from CG1 students, since the course was also a formal part of their curriculum.", "Nevertheless, EG students\u2019 increased regulation at posttest was not reflected in the regulation behaviour of CG1 students.", "Furthermore, the assessment of students\u2019 metacognitive regulation was exclusively based on their verbalised problem-solving.", "It can be assumed, however, that students do not always explicitly articulate their thinking and regulation (Meijer et al.", "2006), implying that the identification of metacognitive utterances in the think-aloud protocols might not have been exhaustive.", "Another limitation of think-aloud protocol analysis concerns the risk of reactivity (Greene et al.", "2011), since asking students to verbalise can

"Recent studies discuss for instance the need for guidance and structure (Bonk et al., 2004; Johnson & Johnson, 1996; Laurillard, 1998), scaffolding (McLoughlin & Marshall, 2000; Mercer & Wegerif, 1999; Rickard, 2004), or facilitation (Clouston, 2005) as mutually dependent factors facilitating meaningful online discourse.", "Based on a number of both theoretical and empirical arguments, it can be argued that tutors can play a beneficial role in this context.", "As to the importance of structured activity in online collaboration, it should be taken into account that although interactive media are seen as giving much greater freedom of control to the user, this self-control can lead to difficulties in organising the input of information, in structuring the discussion, and in developing a per- sonal overview, resulting in lower levels of knowledge construction (Schellens & Valcke, 2005).", "In this respect, some authors point at a critical precondition to consider the learner\u2019s need to discern structure in the messages (Laurillard, 1998).", "Johnson and Johnson (1996) for example underscore that, whether the cooperative setting makes use of technology or not, structuring the activity is essential for academic success.", "Moreover, Cohen (1994) stresses that tutors can play a compensating role in low-level interactions, since the structuring interven- tions of tutors can raise the level of the discourse and can ensure that disengaged students get reconnected.", "A second and related critical factor to foster productive interactions in collaborative settings is the explicit student need for assistance.", "The need for guidance and online support in CSCL settings is comparable to the need of classroom support in face-to-face settings (Lazonder, Wilhelm, & Ootes, 2003).", "Bonk et al.", "(2004) state that the guidance and moderating skills of the instructor are vital for online team success.", "Falchikov (2001) refers to the importance of

(Vygotsky, 1978), can be considered as a central concept.", "Scaffolding is provided to learners by a more capable expert, teacher, or peer helping the learners to perform a task they would normally

similar role position of peers supporting one another as compared to staff support entails beneficial effects on motivation (Neville, 1999).", "Building on the empirical base regarding the importance

spelling ability greatly depend on knowledge of word structure at the level of morphemes.", "In spite of authoritative support spanning more than two decades for teaching mor- phemes or morphographs, there has been little empirical support for the possible benefits of morphograph instruc- tion for learners with or without disabilities (Dixon, 1991).", "Wysocki and Jenkins (1987) investigated the extent to which morphological generalization could account for increases in vocabulary size.", "The study tested students\u2019 ability to use morphological and contextual information to determine the meaning of unknown words.", "Results showed that students were able to make use of knowledge of word structure to infer the meaning of the unknown words.", "In a similar study, Carlisle (2000) analyzed the effects of mor- phological awareness on word reading and reading compre- hension with a group of third and fifth graders.", "Results showed that awareness of structure and meanings of derived words were significantly related to the ability to define mor- phologically complex words.", "Despite these promising results, more research needs to address the potential benefits of mor- phograph instruction on vocabulary acquisition and gener- alization compared to traditional approaches to vocabulary instruction (e.g., whole word).", "In addition to considerations regarding the strategy for teaching new vocabulary, the National Reading Panel (2000) suggested that decisions regarding task presentation (e.g., learning strategies, context, computer technology) need to be made.", "Explicit instruction of roots and affixes could be done through presentation and creation of oral and written exam- ples in context (Moats, 2000).", "Carnine, Silbert, Kame\u2019enui, and Tarver (2004) recommended directly teaching the most commonly used morphemes (e.g., co, pre, able).", "According to an analysis by Moats (2000), if students receive direct instruction in the meanings of the most commonly used pre- fixes, identification of base words when common suffixes are removed, and the spelling changes associated with the addition of inflections beginning with vowels, they can suc- cessfully analyze 250 new printed words per year through morphological analysis.", "One efficient learning strategy that increases task engage- ment and the number of opportunities for practice is recip- rocal peer tutoring (Heron, Villareal, Yao, Christianson, & Heron, 2006; Maheady, Mallette, & Harper, 2006).", "Peer tutoring is an evidence-based strategy that increases active student engagement and provides multiple opportunities to practice academic content with immediate delivery of cor- rective feedback (Heron et al., 2006; Maheady et al., 2006).", "One limitation of peer tutoring is that the tutor needs to have available the correct response to provide accurate feedback.", "This can be difficult when working with a population with limited reading skills.", "One solution is to make correct responses available through audio feedback (Van Norman & Wood, 2008).", "This changes the role of the tutor to con- current learner, provider of social reinforcers, and audience, which may help the learner to attempt responses before using audio feedback.", "Using computers for this purpose is efficient and advan- tageous.", "Computer-assisted instruction is an individualized approach that can reach students at all levels (Kolich, 1991).", "Some studies suggest that computer-assisted vocabulary instruction shows positive learning gains over traditional methods (Davidson, Elcock, & Noyes, 1996; Heise, Papelewis, & Tanner, 1991; Heller, Sturner, Funk, & Feezor, 1993; Reinking & Rickman, 1990).", "The purpose of this study was to add morphograph instruction to current and recommended practices for teaching vocabulary and to determine its effects on the acquisition and generalization of vocabulary.", "The research questions for this study were as follows: 1.", "To what extent does teaching the meaning of mor- phographs result in higher acquisition of vocabu- lary than when students are taught word meaning without attention to morphographs?", "2.", "To what extent does teaching the meaning of mor- phographs result in greater acquisition of novel words with those morphographs than when students are taught without attention

materials, a desktop personal computer, and a laptop computer.", "A video camera was used to record tutoring sessions and probes.", "For the tutoring sessions, only one pair of students was in the resource classroom at a time.", "For the pretests and probes, all eight students were in the resource classroom at one time.", "Measures Pretests.", "The experimenter (second author) created 48-item pretests given at the beginning of the study and following every two tutoring sessions.", "An item contained a sentence with a blank for which a vocabulary word would be selected to complete the sentence.", "Each sentence was composed so there was sufficient context to predict the missing vocabulary word, if familiar to the student.", "In addition, each item contained the correct vocabulary word and three distractors, all with mor- phographs, that would be a focus of the next two sessions.", "The experimenter mixed the position of the correct vocabulary selection across items.", "Of the 48 pretest items, 8 contained less complex sentence structures and easier, nontargeted vocabu- lary words that included the same morphographs.", "These items were interspersed within the pretest to decrease frustration level and ensure some success for the students.", "After assessing the pretest scores for each student, the experimenter discarded a maximum of 2 words per morphograph (8 total from the 40 words) that were known by the majority of the students to ensure that words already known by the students would not be used for instruction or generalization.", "The remaining 8 words per morphograph (32 total) were used in the subsequent set of two tutorial sessions and and in the probe.", "Probes.", "Probes tested both vocabulary acquisition and vocabulary generalization and had the same format as the pretests (i.e., multiple-choice sentences, each with four pos- sible answers).", "As explained previously, each probe used the 32 words composed of four morphographs from the pretest.", "With an equal distribution of words across the four mor- phographs, each morphograph was represented on the probe with 2 taught words and 6 generalization words.", "In addition to items representing the 32 words, nontargeted vocabulary words and sentences were interspersed within the probe, bringing the total to 40.", "The students could attain a total of 4 correct responses for each condition (8 total) on the taught words and 12 correct responses for each condition (24 total) on the generalization words.", "The nontargeted items were not included in scores.", "Dependent variables.", "Two dependent variables were mea- sured in this study: acquisition of vocabulary and general- ization of vocabulary.", "Acquisition of vocabulary was defined as the number of directly taught words, in each condition, that were correctly selected as answers on a multiple choice probe.", "Generalization of vocabulary was defined as the per- centage of novel words, in each condition, that included a morphograph common to the directly taught words.", "A max- imum of two known words per morphograph could be dis- carded for each participant after the pretest.", "Based on pretest results, some students correctly selected more than two items per morphograph, causing the number of items possible for acquisition and generalization to change on a participant-by- participant basis for the probe.", "Therefore, the optimal num- ber of words learned varied by participant when determining cumulative totals.", "When measuring generalization, percent- ages were used to account for the variability in possible words.", "Item-by-item recording was used to measure the number of correct responses of both learned and generalized words on probes given after every two sessions.", "Answers were scored as correct if the participant circled the answer choice or wrote the letter of the answer choice that appropriately fit the fill- in-the-blank sentence.", "If the wrong answer choice was cir- cled or recorded, the item was counted as incorrect.", "Interscorer reliability.", "Because the probes were written products, copies of all unscored probes were made so the secondary data collector could independently score answers as correct and incorrect.", "A second scorer used an answer key to evaluate the accuracy of students\u2019 responses on probes.", "Interscorer reliability was measured by comparing the exper- imenter\u2019s scores and the secondary rater\u2019s scores on an item- by-item basis.", "Answers that were incorrect were marked with an X, and answers that were correct were marked with a C. Interscorer reliability was calculated by counting the number of agreements, dividing by the number of agree- ments plus disagreements, and multiplying by 100.", "Inter- scorer reliability was measured for 30% of the probes; agreement was 100%.", "42 Remedial and Special Education 33(1) Social validity.", "Social validity data were collected to measure the outcome of the study from the students\u2019 perspectives.", "Social validity questionnaires concerning the usefulness of whole-word instruction and/or morphograph instruction were used at the end of the study.", "Experimental Design The experimental design was a simultaneous treatments design (Tawney & Gast, 1984) to analyze the comparative effects of whole-word vocabulary instruction and morpho- graphic instruction on students\u2019 vocabulary acquisition and generalization.", "Because the focus of the study was on the acquisition of new vocabulary through the generalization of morphographs, those data were graphed to allow for visual comparison of the effects of two conditions\u2014teaching of whole words and teaching of words with explicit instruction of the morphograph and word.", "Visual analysis of the graphed data was used to compare treatments.", "The basic feature of this design is the fast alternation of two different interven- tions or treatment conditions with an individual learner or group of learners.", "Specifically, the interventions in this type of design are alternated and counterbalanced within sessions, meaning that students are exposed to both morphograph and whole-word conditions within one session.", "In a simultaneous treatments design, a functional relationship becomes compel- ling when there is clear separation between the data paths representing measures of the two dependent variables.", "The data for the acquisition of vocabulary are presented in a cumulative graph.", "Because the number of directly taught words was limited to four per condition per probe, a cumula- tive graph allows for a visual comparison of trajectories, not evident in a session-by-session representation.", "Procedures General procedures.", "The experimenter created PowerPoint slides that contained each session\u2019s content (e.g., instruc- tions, words, example sentences, clickable icons for audio recordings of the sentences).", "Figures 1 and 2 show example slides used for peer tutoring for the whole-word and mor- phograph conditions, respectively.", "The study lasted 14 weeks and included tutor training sessions, tutoring sessions, and pretest and probe sessions.", "Tutoring sessions took place 2 days per week and lasted approximately 7 min for each pair.", "Following the experi- menter\u2019s direction to begin, the pairs began tutoring.", "Although each session was recorded via videotape, the experimenter closely monitored each pair to ensure proper procedures were followed.", "After every two peer tutoring sessions, a probe was conducted to evaluate the extent to which students had learned the vocabulary words and gen- eralization (untaught) vocabulary words.", "Prior to the start Figure 1.", "Example slides for computer-assisted peer tutoring during the whole-word condition of the next set of tutoring sessions, another pretest was used to select unknown words for the next two sessions.", "The majority of words used in this study came from lists in workbooks by Draze (2005a, 2005b) and Vurnakes (1998).", "The word lists were organized by prefixes, suffixes, and word roots.", "Of the approximately 400 words used in this study, one fourth of these words were directly taught in the tutorial program, with the remaining words used as gener- alization words during probes.", "The words were assigned to tutoring pairs so that two pairs of students learned half of the words through morphograph instruction whereas the other two pairs of students learned those words with only whole- word instruction.", "The reverse took place for the other half of the words.", "Tutor training.", "The experimenter trained all students on the steps of reciprocal peer tutoring (tutoring and feedback) during three 15-min training sessions prior to data collec- tion.", "All students received step-by-step instructions for the role of tutor and tutee.", "Specifically, the students were taught appropriate tutoring behaviors (e.g., speaking clearly) as Wood et al.", "43 Probing.", "After every second tutoring session, a probe was conducted on all 8 words that the students learned (as both tutor and tutee) as well as the 24 generalization words.", "The procedures used in pretesting students were repeated for each probe.", "Of the probes, 40% were recorded for reliabil- ity measures.", "All probes lasted approximately 30 min.", "Conditions The tutoring program was set up so that each student acted as tutor and tutee for a total of four words each session.", "For each pair, one student in the pair was selected to consistently start the session in the tutor role.", "In every session, two words with prefixes and two words with roots were introduced.", "One prefix and one word root were assigned to each condition, representing four morphographs in all.", "The condition iden- tified to start the session alternated each session and within each session the two conditions alternated as well.", "For exam- ple, one tutoring pair began a session with the first word part being taught using the whole-word condition and the second word being taught using the morphograph condition.", "The following session, the tutoring program would begin with the morphograph condition followed by the whole-word condition.", "Whole-word condition.", "The whole-word condition intro- duced an unknown vocabulary word, asked the student to predict the meaning based on the context of a sentence, and then provided the correct definition for the student to repeat.", "Figure 1 shows example slides for computer-assisted peer tutoring during the whole-word condition.", "Morphograph condition.", "The morphograph condition introduced the meaning of the morphograph and asked the student to repeat the morphograph and its meaning.", "The student was then given a word containing that same mor- phograph and was asked to use knowledge of the morpho- graph (word part) and the context to predict the meaning of the word in a sentence.", "The correct definition was then pro- vided for the student to repeat.", "Figure 2 shows example slides for computer-assisted peer tutoring during the mor- phograph condition.", "Procedural reliability.", "A second observer used a checklist of the procedural steps to obtain reliability.", "Procedural reli- ability was calculated as the percentage of steps completed correctly across 30% of the sessions.", "The mean procedural reliability across sessions was 95%.", "Results Acquisition of Vocabulary The cumulative number of words acquired for each partici- pant is shown in Figures 3 and 4.",

for tutee) in the PowerPoint slides.", "Tutors were taught to click icons to activate audio recordings of text read aloud and to advance the slides.", "Data collection began when tutoring pairs demonstrated correct tutoring behaviors and made no procedural errors during the training session.", "Pretesting.", "The experimenter met with the four tutoring pairs in the resource classroom.", "Prior to beginning the pre- tests, the experimenter instructed the students to underline any words or word parts they thought they knew and to circle the letter of the best answer choice for each

Conditional cash transfer; Peer-tutoring; Remedial education JEL classification: O11, I21 I.", "INTRODUCTION G overnment and nongovernment agencies are increasingly using condi- tional cash transfer

may request a high-performing student to help another under-performing student in the same classroom.", "These teachers are typically neither trained in the method nor have the time or incentive to provide extra supervision\u2014a problem more serious in underdeveloped rural areas.", "The tutors and tutees are left to sort things out by themselves, which is obviously not easy.", "Because of these limita- tions, peer-assisted learning remains at a rudimentary level in China.", "The experiences of the industrialized countries suggest that successful peer- assisted learning is a very skill-intensive and time-consuming teaching method (Topping 2000).", "Trained teachers need to play a central role.", "Tutoring protocols need to be carefully designed.", "Regular tutoring sessions

is to test the effectiveness of a peer-tutoring program specifically designed for developing countries.", "If students respond to economic incentives as adults do, a properly designed labor contract for peer tutors may boost their effort level and improve tutoring efficiency in the absence of extra teacher interventions.", "This motivated us to add an incentive contract on top of a stream- lined peer-tutoring program.", "Tutors (strong students) in our one-to-one tutoring programs were eligible to compete for a prize in a tournament.", "Both the chance of getting the prize and its size were conditional on the test score improvement of the tutee (weak student) who was paired with the tutor.", "To simulate the realities in developing countries, we required neither structured peer interactions nor teacher monitoring.", "To test our idea, we ran a field experiment in two migrant children primary schools in Shanghai, China.", "Such schools educate millions of poor migrant chil- dren (see Section II).", "With the prize of an official certificate the program showed improvements in the grades of under-performing children by 0.615 standard devia- tions over a semester.", "Adding a monetary reward (labeled a scholarship in our program) to the prize made the impact larger and more robust.", "Even though there is evidence of heterogeneity in program effects, in most program

entitlement similar to local citizenship), primary education is now almost free.", "However, migrants without hukou have to pay a very high fee to enter the local public schools.", "Most migrants cannot afford it, creating a huge demand for paid education services provided by migrant children schools, regardless of their quality.", "Because students are geographically very mobile, cur- riculum in these schools typically follows standard national guidelines.", "In China, the primary school curriculum is highly centralized.", "The Ministry of Education makes sure that textbooks are more or less similar across the nation, and pro- vides rigid guidelines regarding every aspect of the curriculum, including sub- jects offered, or even how each individual lecture should be taught.", "The teachers are expected to closely follow these guidelines.", "Migrant children schools also offer standard subjects such as math, Chinese, English, physical education, music, etc.", "Just like other Chinese schools, they put a lot more emphasis on math, Chinese, and English, because these will eventually be tested in the pres- tigious national college entrance exam.", "Students typically spend the whole day in class, and go home only in late afternoon.", "Local governments not only refuse to lower the discriminating barrier so that migrant children can enter the local public schools, but also try to control or even eliminate migrant children schools.", "The motive is probably control over perma- nent migration.", "In 2006 the Beijing city government began a campaign to shut down over 200 migrant children schools.", "The Shanghai city government followed suit, and set a goal of eliminating all migrant children schools that did not meet the high standards set by the local government by 2010.", "However, because the local governments have no plan to educate all migrant children with their own resources, it is impossible to completely root out these schools.", "When a school is closed down by the government, it usually reopens in another location with a different name.", "Financial constraints and adverse government policy seriously crippled the development of migrant children schools.", "Despite the fact that these schools are located in China\u2019s richest cities, they resemble schools in poor rural areas that lag behind the urban public schools by several decades.", "Given the political realities, it is almost impossible to improve education quality in these migrant schools through more traditional methods.", "We are therefore left with very few options.", "Improving peer-assisted learning is one of them.", "In our study the local government (i.e., the Shanghai local government) had established School A only one year before our experiment.", "The government sent a formal teacher from a local public school to serve as the headmaster; this was the \u00a9 2012 The Author The Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies 338 the developing economies only staff member on a regular government payroll.2 School B, a more typical migrant children school, was several years old and a private school owned by its headmaster.", "Because of the difference in ownership, School A had better and self-owned facilities, possibly better school administration, and possibly higher teacher morale.", "The most important benefit, however, was government recognition.", "Note that migrant schools are often closed by the government at will.", "Since School A was recognized by the local government, it was free from such arbitrary treatment.", "The teachers and students in these two schools were otherwise quite similar.", "The students were all migrant children.", "There were 419 students in School A (excluding grade 1) in 2007.", "The average number of students per class was 47.", "There were 692 students in School B (also excluding grade 1) in 2007.", "The average number of stu- dents per class was 53.", "The class size in both schools was quite big.", "Student tuition and fees (about RMB500 or US$60 a semester) were the main source of funding in each school.", "There was no government funding of any sort in either school.", "The conditions in migrant children schools make it impossible to implement a traditional peer-tutoring program.", "For example, tutor\u2013tutee study sessions\u2014 typical in traditional tutoring programs\u2014are not feasible since migrant children schools have limited available space.", "Also, students have a full-day schedule.", "And it is neither safe to keep students after school nor possible to do so, since everyone wants to go home to dinner after a long school day.", "Students may live far apart from each other in a large city like Shanghai.", "This is also the reason we did not want to randomly assign tutor and tutee (see Section III).", "We were hoping that students living close to each other would team up and have more interaction after school, but there was no way for us to require them to do so in such a large city.", "Teachers are hired on a contractual basis at a low wage (typically about US$100, or RMB 700\u2013800 per month).", "Job loyalty is therefore very low.", "For example, a salesgirl with a senior high school diploma might come to work as a teacher for a year or two, and then move on to another job unrelated to teaching.", "To save money, student\u2013teacher ratios are typically quite high.", "Asking these teachers to do any- thing beyond their normal teaching duties, such as supervising the tutoring process, is unreasonable.", "Additionally, schools have little incentive to improve teaching.", "They are for-profit businesses with a short expected time horizon.", "They may be closed down by the government at any time simply because the government does not want them to exist.", "Whether the schools provide high-quality teaching is not a concern of the government.", "2 One strategy the government takes is to retain and control a small number of migrant schools after closing down others.", "This is because of strong pressure from the central government, the media, and the international community.", "Then some limited resources may be provided to these selected schools.", "To reduce its payout, the local government would not provide help to the migrant schools without controlling the numbers of such schools.",

one program class in our study.", "At the beginning of the academic semester, we invited an equal number of weak and strong students to participate in our Peer-Tutoring Program.", "Priority was given to those who did worst/best in the final exams in the previous semester.3 Information sessions were organized in each class to introduce the program details to the prospective students.", "These students brought home a formal invitation letter that also listed the program outlines.", "We asked the parents of the invited children to sign and return the invitation letters if they wanted their children to participate.", "Each weak student was matched with a strong student in his or her own class who served as a peer tutor.", "Both had a say in choosing their partner.", "The voluntary matching process was coordinated by our enumerators and the teachers.", "We did not opt for random assignment mainly because we believed that teachers and students could use their private information to improve the quality of matching, which may contribute to better tutoring outcomes.", "We encouraged the tutors and tutees to interact more frequently between classes and at lunchtime but we did not formally require them to do anything during school or after school, nor did we ask the teachers to pay special attention to our programs.", "Our design was intended to reduce external involvement in the project such that its success did not depend on such efforts.", "As we discussed in detail in Section II, more structured peer interaction and teacher monitoring was difficult to implement in our context.", "According to our interviews at the end of the program, informal peer-tutoring did occur.", "For example, the tutors helped the tutees do their problem sets, explained to them things they did not understand well, and so on.", "The key to our experiment was a formal incentive contract (tournament) designed to encourage the tutors\u2019 efforts.", "The output of a tutor\u2019s effort was measured by improvement in the academic performance of his or her partner over the semester.", "The teacher\u2019s behavior and disciplinary environment did not affect the effectiveness of the tournament because they are common shocks to all tutors in the same class (Lazear and Rosen 1981).", "The improvement was defined as the difference between the rank of the total scores of the semester finals immediately before and following the program.", "3 Since ranking of the final was public information in these schools our invitation did not reveal additional information.", "\u00a9 2012 The Author The Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies 340 the developing economies We did not use simple linear contracts, which would have provided teachers with the perverse incentive to inflate tutees\u2019 grades.", "Shastry and Linden (2009) provide one example that teachers in developing countries may inflate student performance to help them get more resources from aid agencies.", "Tournament helped us fix the total amount of resources provided to a particular class (RMB 300 per monetary- program class in our design) so that teachers would have minimal incentives to distort the educational outcome.", "Using a linear contract also requires that different tests are comparable so that students could be paid according to the score differ- ence.", "This is unrealistic in poor countries.", "Note that in China even the most important college entrance exam scores cannot be compared over different years.", "It is probably not a coincidence that the most well-known cash incentive program performed in a poor country used tournament as well (Kremer, Miguel, and Thornton 2009).", "Our experiment provided two types of incentive contract to the peer tutors: the nonmonetary incentive peer-tutoring program (or nonmonetary program) and the monetary incentive peer-tutoring program (or monetary program).", "Students and parents were aware of the types of program they would participate in at the very beginning of the semester.", "Let us first consider the monetary program.", "A typical program class in our experiment had ten peer tutors and ten weak students.", "The top prize of RMB 100 (about one-fifth of a semester\u2019s tuition and fees) was awarded to the tutor whose partner made the largest improvement during the semester.4 Four second prizes of RMB 50 went to the four tutors whose partners made the next four largest improve- ments.", "Five third prizes (small gifts) were awarded to the rest of the tutors.", "An official certificate of award, which clearly stated the achievement and the level of award, accompanied each prize.", "There was also public recognition at each school\u2019s awards assembly held for students and teachers.", "The nonmonetary program was identical, except that monetary rewards were removed.", "We were careful not to provide direct incentives to the tutees because we wanted to clearly identify the consequences of strengthening the tutors\u2019 incen- tives alone.", "It is entirely plausible that allowing the winning tutor to share the prize with her partner (a type of group incentive, which is more difficult to interpret) would improve our program effects and make the financial rewards more equitable, but this would be an entirely different economic problem.", "In another working paper we report very encouraging program effects from a large-scale randomized experiment using the group-incentive scheme to motivate peer-tutoring.", "4 The size of the prize is relatively large.", "In a day trip (which cost RMB 70 per student) organized by School B, 56.2% of the students did not go because of economic reasons.", "\u00a9 2012 The Author The Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute

instruction.", "Thus, \u201cteacher buy-in\u201d may have been different from other contexts where PALS has been used.", "Future researchers examining the efficacy of interventions like PALS may benefit from including variables of teaching style and ori- entation, as well as integration of similar learning principles across other parts of the school day.", "EQAO scores were not related to rate of progress on CBM, but baseline and end-of-year CBM scores were highly corre- lated with EQAO.", "This is likely due to the improvements made in reading fluency across groups and schools (i.e., limited vari- ability in rate of progress), which make it difficult to detect a small to medium effect.", "The effects for baseline and end-of- likely reflect factors year CBM scores, on the other hand, beyond PALS implementation, including other risk factors, such as poverty and significant absences from school.", "These results may also reflect extant concerns in the literature about the utility of CBM testing beyond the beginning reading stage.", "Furthermore, EQAO scores likely tap into numerous other skills involved in reading comprehension, which may explain THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH 175 the null findings.", "The use of cross-curricular reading materials for the EQAO assessments, as well as the testing format, might have produced results akin to ours.", "Specifically, the EQAO test- ing format (i.e., multiple-choice, scantron high-stakes group testing) was likely novel to many of the third-grade students, which may have differentially impacted students across reading achievement levels.", "The empirical literature base on reading fluency is unequiv- ocal: Children with better reading fluency have better outcomes on a number of factors, including improved reading compre- hension (Eason, Sabatini, Goldberg, Bruce, & Cutting, 2013), lower rates of special education placement (Denton et al., 2013), and higher high school graduation rates (Taylor, Pearson, Peterson, & Rodriguez, 2005).", "It is clearly to the bene- fit of students and school systems if student receive early inter- vention to prevent poor reading fluency.", "Based on the results from our analyses, the majority of students across the school board made tremendous gains in their reading fluency, even when there were multiple challenges in the implementation of the intervention.", "Unfortunately due to small cell sizes (seven schools per group), we were not able to clearly assess the effect of challenges to the intervention.", "If one examines just the effect sizes, there is a moderate effect for implementation group.", "This suggests that if we had more schools per group, we may have been able to detect a statistically significant difference.", "Also notably, the CBM strategy that is attached to PALS is effective as a predictor of EQAO performance.", "Schools whose CBM scores reflect students with poorer reading fluency at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year will have the lowest scores on EQAO.", "This may suggest that these students need a more targeted intervention or enhanced serv- ices in order for their reading performance to improve.", "The developers of the PALS program have noted that the lowest performing students in any environment are unlikely to experi- ence excellent improvement following the PALS intervention and will probably need additional assistance (D. Fuchs, Comp- ton, Fuchs, Bryant, & Davis, 2008).", "It is likely that these data reflect this scenario.", "These data also have a good news element: because all students improve at a steadily similar rate within the PALS intervention, it is clear that all students are benefiting from this relatively time- and cost-intensive intervention.", "Regardless of the positive outcomes associated with the PALS intervention, this study was not without limitations.", "First of all, we did not find the significant outcomes that we hypothesized in all cases.", "Part of this is the inherent limitation in using provin- cially mandated testing as an outcome.", "These tests are group- administered and the reading tests actually assess the ability to comprehend content across a number of content domains as well as requiring significant test-taking skills on the part of stu- dents.", "The modest correlations of the EQAO scores over time without significant changes in student populations are indicators of the problems associated with this kind of testing.", "Although our grouping variable may be judged as problematic, we were limited by the available data.", "Yet, data reflecting socioeconomic status of the cachement areas for the schools partially validates our strategy.", "Future researchers may benefit from a more inde- pendently derived grouping variable.", "Last, these results represent the experiences of one school district in Southwestern Ontario (Canada).", "As a result, the results may not generalize to other 176 G. JONES ET AL.", "districts, particularly those that are significantly more rural or with different risk factors for reading failure.", "The use of CBM as an intervention monitoring system has also been criticized by some researchers.", "Although there are a small handful of studies suggesting that CBM should robustly predict performance on group high-stakes testing such as EQAO (e.g., Schmitt, Balles, & Venesky, 2013), this assessment method is not without flaws.", "There are several studies suggest- ing that students who are English-as-a-second-language learn- ers or who are receiving special education services (Reschley, Busch, Betts, Deno, & Long, 2009; Yeo, 2010) may not demon- strate the same highly predictive relations between CBM and high-stakes testing performance.", "A more recent study also reported that the relations between CBM performance and end-of-year testing are attenuated in lower achieving readings (Kilgus, Methe, Maggin, & Tomasula, 2014).", "The emphasis on speeded performance (fluency) in the CBM assessments also did not address comprehension or the ability to apply informa- tion learned through reading.", "Likewise, research in a more behaviorally focused paradigm has criticized CBM for not con- sidering the source of errors during reading and the poor con- trol (nonequivalence) of passage reading difficulty (Ardoin, Roof, Klubnick, & Carfolite, 2008).", "Furthermore, studies that have included measures of reading attitudes as well as CBM data in predicting end-of-year reading achievement have reported significant effects for reading attitudes (e.g., Martinez, Aricak, & Jewell, 2008).", "Thus, although there is significant sup- port for the use of CBM, particular in the context of the PALS program, this strategy has also received significant critical attention.", "In the case of this particular study, there may have been stronger results if lower performing students had also received more instruction to promote oral language develop- ment or more exposure to global knowledge.", "In summary, our results indicate that PALS is an effective intervention, even when delivered in a very different context than in which it was developed.", "Across the school board in which PALS was implemented, students experienced improve- ments in their reading fluency.", "Although the intervention required significant re-allocations of time and human resour- ces, students clearly benefited.", "As school boards consider how to deliver elementary school instruction in light of ongoing concerns about budgeting and Ministry of Education curricula, it is critical that the learning needs of students be considered.", "Acknowledgements The authors wish to thank the reviewers for their helpful comments on the original draft of this manuscript.", "Additionally, Dr. Doug Fuchs at Vanderbilt University provided some very helpful comments several years ago, which informed our analytic plan.", "References Ardoin, S.

facing many challenges.", "On one hand, the student body is itself becoming more diverse in age, expe- rience level, motivation, and learning need (Brown and Kysilka 2002; Carter and McNeill 1998; Odell et al.", "2003); on the other hand, institutions are facing growing resources constrains (Salerno 2005) rapid technological advancements, demographic changes, and a growing demand for accessibility and equity (Whitt et al.", "2008).", "Along this process, colleges and universities have been called upon to address these challenges by focusing more intentionally and systematically on undergraduate programs in terms of student retention and academic outcomes (Arco et al.", "2005; Wolf-wendel et al.", "2009).", "Regarding student retention, despite some difficulties in making comparisons across countries, given the fact that each country defines and calculates such rates in particular ways, there exists some useful information on degree completion rates for the year 2003 (the number of degrees completed per 100 students enrolled).", "The following countries have these completion rates (Davies 2006; Instituto de Evaluacio \u0301n 2009; Van Stolk et al.", "2007): Japan 26%, the United Kingdom 24%, Australia 23%, Denmark 23%, Ireland 21%, France 20%, Korea 18%, Sweden 18%, United States 17%, and Spain 17%.", "In Spain, there are 77 institutions of higher education (50 public and 27 private).", "About 84% of the students access the university through a national exam.", "In the last 20 years, student enrollments have multiplied threefold, and faculty and staff have grown at a similar rate.", "Furthermore, the number of graduates has grown up to 77% during this period of time.", "During the academic year 2008\u20132009, a total of 1,504,276 students were registered in higher education (including 1,358,875 undergraduate students, 49,799 master\u2019s students and 77,249 Ph.D. students).", "The University of Granada (UGR), particularly, is a public university located in the city of Granada, in southern part of Spain.", "It is one of the five largest research universities in the country, offering more than 70% of the academic specializations and official degrees offered in the country (Ministerio de Educacio \u0301n 2009).", "In 2008\u20132009, it had about 56,000 undergraduate and 30,000 postgraduate registered students.", "Studies on the quality of the Spanish higher education show a low productivity level, especially among freshmen students (Consejo de Coordinacio \u0301n Universitaria 2002).", "While the number freshmen students within this system is quite high, the percentage of dropouts reaches 26%; moreover, while 48% of university students do repeat course, at one point or another in their program of study, only 26% of the students finish their studies in due time (Consejo de Coordinacio \u0301n Universitaria 2002; Gutie \u0301rrez 2002; Pozo 2000; Rodr\u0131 \u0301guez 2004).", "In consequence, the average duration of university programs for a great number of students is almost half over the institutionally pre-established time.", "Interestingly enough, in technical programs, 30% of the students repeat the first year, while the percentage of students who take final exams at the end of the course falls below 30% (Consejo de Coordinacio \u0301n Universitaria 2002).", "Among the factors that may contribute to this situation are (a) that lecturing in large classroom halls is the predominant teaching style\u2014a style that does not provide ample opportunities for student participation; (b) that class atten- dance is not required in order to take exams or pass the class; and (c) that professors\u2019 spend office hours mainly doing grade revisions after exams (Consejo de Coordinacio \u0301n Universitaria 2002).", "Other contextual factors affecting students\u2019 engagement and persis- tence during their university studies have to do with the way in which the institution allocates its resources and organizes both services and learning opportunities to encourage students to participate in, and benefit from, Academic and Student Affairs programs (Kuh 1996; Pascarella and Terenzini 2005).", "123 High Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788 775 If, to all this, one adds the great variability in the profiles of students entering the University (Brown and Kysilka 2002; Carter and McNeill 1998; Guardia 2000; Odell et al.", "2003) and the fact that 60% of the drop-outs take place during the first academic year, it is easy to see that something needs to be done in order to reverse the situation (Consejo de Coordinacio \u0301n Universitaria 2002).", "Needless to say, such low levels of retention and per- formance, besides having a high economic and social cost and causing considerable levels of frustration among students and university faculty and administrators, significantly and negatively affect the quality of teaching (Ferna \u0301ndez et al.", "2010).", "This is why so many authors have devoted a great deal of effort to developing models, activities and programs that may prevent academic failure (Bean 1990; Carter and McNeill 1998; Clark 2005; Lee et al.", "2009; Mart\u0131 \u0301n et al.", "2004; Murtaugh et al.", "1999; Pascarella and Terenzini 2005; Pozo 2000; Ryan and Glenn 2003; Rodr\u0131 \u0301guez 2004; Tinto 1993).", "Established theories and constructs long associated with student success (including involvement, engagement, and integration) have effectively guided educational practice for decades; but, most recently, research studies advocate for researchers and policy makers to be critical of the traditional theories of student retention and to pose new questions related to how students participate in college and to which extent current theories account for diverse learners (Wolf-wendel et al.", "2009).", "This is particularly important, considering the growing cultural diversity of the student body and the relatively low effectiveness of the most widely-cited theories for explaining the drop-out phenomenon among college students (Guiffrida 2006).", "Al the local level, the evaluation reports undertaken by the UGR also reflect the need to introduce some useful institutional measures so as to increase student retention and success (Arco-Tirado and Ferna \u0301ndez-Balboa 2003).", "So far, two types of institutional answers have been developed: (a) Academic and Student Affairs programs offering help and support to new students so as to facilitate their integration into the new social and academic envi- ronment and (b) programs designed to increase and enhance the psycho-pedagogical skills of the professoriate.", "The Peer Tutoring Program (PTP) studied in the present study is one of the programs in the first category.", "More concretely, the PTP is a program of psycho- pedagogical intervention based on peer tutoring sessions whereby older, more experienced students (seniors, Master\u2019s) undergo a tutoring training seminar taught by the UGR\u2019s professional staff (Dura \u0301n and Vidal 2004; Topping 1996).", "The PTP draws upon counseling approaches and seeks to enable students to know, understand, and decide how to spend time on task, engage in quality effort, and participate more actively in learning.", "All this seems to foster greater student autonomy and involvement.", "Although such an approach has had a long-standing tradition in secondary schooling (e.g., Dura \u0301n and Vidal 2004; Kuh 2009; Robinson et al.", "2005; Rohrbeck et al.", "2003; Tindall 1995; Topping and Ehly 1998), it has been occasionally applied at the university level for preventive purposes, as well.", "In this vein, several studies and reports (e.g., Benavent and Fossati 1990; Blowers et al.", "2003; Ferna \u0301ndez et al.", "2003; Fresko 1997; Griffin and Griffin 1997; Griffiths et al.", "1995; Higgins 2004; Kuresman 2008; Lake 1999; Mynard and Almarzouqi 2006; Nestel and Kidd 2003; Quintrell and Westwood 1994; Topping 1996; Tuckman 2003; Warwick and Holton 2001; Xu et al.", "2001) show that, by trusting that students are in the best position to identify their own induction needs (Carter and McNeill 1998), these programs tend to achieve high levels of efficacy and efficiency in addressing diverse problems, such as academic failure, cognitive and metacognitive strategies deficit, and difficulties in social integration (Topping 1996, 2005).", "Little is known, however, about the effects of these programs upon the tutors, with the exception of some data on personal satisfaction, which, in general, achieves quite high scores (Topping 1996).", "123 776 High Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788 To both ends, the following hypotheses were established: Hypothesis 1 As a result of the PTP, there will be a statistically significant improvement in the freshmen treatment group\u2019s Grade Point Average (GPA), reflected in the Academic Report, as compared to that of the freshmen control group.", "Hypothesis 2 As a result of the PTP, there will be a statistically significant improvement in the freshmen treatment group\u2019s Performance Rate (PR) (i.e., the coefficient of the number of credits passed divided by the number of credits registered), reflected in the Academic Report, as compared to that of the control group.", "Hypothesis 3 As a result of the PTP, there will be a statistically significant improvement in the freshmen treatment group\u2019s Success Rate (SR) (i.e., the coefficient of the number of credits passed divided by the number of credits examined),

treatment group\u2019s cognitive and metacognitive strategies (measured by the Pozar\u2019s Study habits inventory, 2002), as compared to those of the freshmen control group.", "Hypothesis 5 As a result of the PTP, there will be a statistically significant pre- and post- test difference within the freshmen treatment group\u2019s cognitive and metacognitive strat- egies, as measured by the Pozar\u2019s Study habits inventory (2002).", "Hypothesis 6 As a result of the PTP, there will be a statistically significant difference in the cognitive and metacognitive strategies of the tutors\u2019 group, as measured by Pozar\u2019s Study habits inventory (2002).", "Hypothesis 7 As a result of the PTP, there will be a statistically significant difference in the social skills of the tutors\u2019 group, as measured by Gismero\u2019 Social skills scale (2000).", "Method Participants The sample of this study consisted of 141 students from the UGR.", "They were distributed in two sub-samples: One hundred freshmen and forty-one tutors.", "As for the freshmen, half of them were randomly assigned to the treatment group while the other half conformed the control group.", "Within the treatment group, twenty freshmen studied Civil Engineering, eleven studied Pharmacy, ten studied Economics, and nine studied Chemical Engineering.", "Furthermore, twenty-six were female and twenty-four were male.", "Their average age was of 17.9 years (range = 17\u201319).", "The control group had an equivalent distribution to that of the control group in terms of degree, gender, and age.", "The tutors\u2019 group was composed of students either in last 2 years of their degree program or already in a postgraduate (doc- toral) program.", "Sixteen of them studied Civil Engineering, nine studied Pharmacy, seven studied Economics, and nine studied Chemical Engineering.", "Among them, fifteen were female and twenty-six were male.", "The average age was 23.9 years (range = 21\u201329).", "The Pozar\u2019s Study Habits Inventory (2002), consisting of 90 multiple-choice items, grouped into 5 scales (i.e., contextual conditions of study, study planning, use of study Materials and instruments 123 High Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788 777 materials, learning of study content, and honesty), was completed by the participants.", "The use of this inventory is justified not only because of the need to measure these cognitive and metacognitive strategies or \u2018\u2018study skills\u2019\u2019 (Tuckman 2003) in higher edu- cation students, but also because of the fact that there are no other standardized instruments with its psychometric properties in Spanish.", "Its reliability index (two-halves model) is higher than .91, its internal validity indexes were (a) between .73 and .86, in the correlation coefficient between direct scores in the inventory\u2019s scales and the scores given by pro- fessors, and (b) higher than .72 in the correlation coefficients among the inventory\u2019s scales.", "All participants also completed the Study Habits Inventory (Pozar 2002).", "A Social Skills Scale (Gismero 2000), composed of 33 multiple-choice items, grouped in 6 sub-scales (i.e., self-expression in social situations, defense of own interests as a con- sumer, expression of discomfort and annoyance, ability of saying \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 and cutting off interactions, ability to make requests, and ability to initiate positive interactions with the opposite sex), was also completed by both the freshmen and the tutors.", "This scale is commonly used to evaluate social skills in adolescents and adults due to its high reliability index (Cronbach alpha .89) and the acceptable validity indexes of .53 (in the correlation coefficient between the overall direct punctuation in the scale and the overall self- descriptors) and between -.84 for aggressiveness and .84 for assertiveness (in the corre- lation coefficient with adjectives).", "The Social Skills Scale (2000) was completed by the tutors only.", "The Academic Report was additionally used to calculate the freshmen\u2019s GPA, PR, and SR.", "Designs and procedures The number of hypotheses of this study required diverse methodological designs (see Ato 1995; Campbell and Stanley 1963).", "For hypotheses 1, 2, and 3, a static-group comparison design was used, hypotheses 4 and 5 required a pretest\u2013posttest control group design, whereas hypotheses 6 and 7 called for a one-group pretest\u2013posttest design.", "The sampling selection was based on a non-probabilistic sampling technique called \u2018\u2018purposeful sampling\u2019\u2019 (Mart\u0131 \u0301nez 1995).", "This technique consists of four sampling stages.", "In the first stage (i.e., selecting the field of study), the UGR was chosen as the field of study due to the fact that it was wherein the PTP was located.", "In the second stage (i.e., inviting participation), the deans of the four UGR degree programs with the lower rates of aca- demic success were asked permission to allow the students in their respective colleges to participate in the PTP and, by extension, in the present study.", "In the third stage (i.e., tentative sampling), the investigators gave oral presentations and provided written mate- rials about the purposes, processes, and requirements of the PTP to nine groups of

senior students and 197 freshmen agreed to participate both in the PTP and the study.", "As such, these volunteers (i.e., the tutors and the freshmen) were asked to (a) sign a \u2018\u2018contract agreement\u2019\u2019 (Ferna \u0301ndez et al.", "2003) containing 14 clauses and one agreement section and detailing the rights and obligations of the participants in the PTP; (b) fill out a Self- Evaluation Report (Ferna \u0301ndez et al.", "2003) consisting of 22 open-ended items and 12 multiple-choice items grouped in 3 areas (i.e., demographic information, academic information, and areas-of-interest information); (c) complete the Study Habits Inventory (Pozar 2002); (d) fill out the Social Skills Scale (Gismero 2000); and (e) provide copies of their Academic Report.", "123 778 High Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788 In the fourth stage (i.e., definite sampling), a final selection process was undertaken.", "Of the 45 doctoral and senior students with initially volunteered, 41 were selected as tutors according to the following criteria: (a) having a GPA higher than 1.5 (in a scale from 0 to 4), (b) having an enneatype whose score was higher than 4 points on each one of the scales of the Pozar\u2019s Study habits inventory (2002), (c) scoring 25 points or higher in 4 of the subscales and the overall direct score on Gismero\u2019s Social skills scale (2000), (d) having positive scores on the rest of the areas of the Self-evaluation reports (Ferna \u0301ndez et al.", "2003), (e) attending the four PTP training sessions, and (f) passing the practical PTP training tests.", "Concerning the 197 freshmen who initially volunteered, 110 were finally selected and paired up according to equivalences in three sets of variables (Brooks and DuBois 1995; Corominas 2001; Harackiewicz et al.", "2008; Leppel 2002; Murtaugh et al.", "1999; Pascarella and Terenzini 2005; Pozo 2000; Rodr\u0131 \u0301guez 2004; Tinto 1993; Tuckman 2003; Valle 1996): (a) demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, nationality); (b) academic variables (e.g., degree program, program year, schedule); and (c) other variables associated with academic success or failure (e.g., cognitive and metacognitive strategies, level of commitment).", "The remaining 87 students were discarded due to the lack of an appropriate match.", "Furthermore, 5 of the 55 initial pairs of freshmen were discarded due to the lack of available tutors (of the 41 tutors, nine agreed to tutor two freshmen).", "As such, the final freshmen group was composed of 50 pairs.", "Once the pairs were established, each member of each pair was randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group.", "Parametric and non-parametric analyses did not reveal significant statistical differences between the groups, thus establishing their equivalence.", "Finally, the matching of the freshmen in the treatment group with their respective tutor was done according to simi- larities in the program of study, schedules, and nationality (Ato 1995; Dura \u0301n and Vidal 2004).", "As mentioned above, the tutors had to undergo a four-session seminar (see Dura \u0301n and Vidal 2004; Tindall 1995).", "Session 1 provided an introduction and a justification of the PTP and instructed tutors and tutees in the use of the Program Manual (a tool used to reflect upon the development and the content of the tutoring sessions, as well as on other aspects of the PTP; see Buela and Sa \u0301nchez 2002; Caballo 1993; Gargallo 2000; Kee 2002; Zarcone 2000).", "The usefulness of the use of the Program Manual was ascertained in a previous pilot study (Ferna \u0301ndez et al.", "2003).", "This first session also provided the ground for the devel- opment of the first tutoring session and the evaluation of the freshmen\u2019s needs.", "Session 2 addressed sleeping habits (Zarcone 2000), eating habits (following the recommendations of the Sociedad Espan \u0303ola de Nutricio \u0301n Ba \u0301sica y Aplicada 2004), and intellectual work habits (e.g., self-regulation, goal setting, time management) (Gargallo 2000).", "Session 3 focused on strategies for classroom note-taking and assignment completion) and intellectual work techniques (e.g., strategies for accessing information databases, organizing, and exam preparation) (Gargallo 2000).", "Session 4 tackled basic social skills (Caballo 1993).", "The PTP process for the freshmen consisted of a ninety-minute session, once a week, for 10 weeks spread over the first semester of the academic year.", "The meeting dates, time, and place had been previously concerted between the freshmen and their respective tutor.", "The tutoring method was mainly based on direct instruction and guided discovery.", "In the first session, tutor and tutee were introduced to one another, exchanged contact telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, discussed the implication of the PTP (including their respective rights and obligations), and elaborated an academic plan (including assignments for the tutee).", "In the second session, the tutee\u2019s previous assignments were revised, and the needs of the tutee were evaluated so as to determine areas of intervention.", "As such, healthy 123 High Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788 779 sleeping habits and study habits, conditions and skills (e.g., goal setting, time management, and self-assessment) were addressed, in view of which, new goals and assignments were established.", "In the third session, the previous assignments were analyzed and the academic plan was adjusted (when necessary).", "Moreover, a plan for \u2018\u2018active\u2019\u2019 listening in class was intellectual/study skills and decision-making techniques were designed, additional explained, and new assignments were set.", "The fifth session served to evaluate all that had happened to that point.", "Afterward, the emphasis was put on reinforcing and re-examining the cognitive and metacognitive strategies and the decision-making processes of the tutees.", "Data analysis The data for hypotheses 1 (re: Freshmen\u2019s GPA), 2 (re: Freshmen\u2019s PR), and 3 (re: Freshmen\u2019s SR) were analyzed through the U of Mann-Whiney and value d of Cohen techniques.", "The data for Hypothesis 4 (re: Freshmen\u2019s intergroup cognitive and metacog- nitive strategies) were analyzed through a discriminant function analysis and an ANOVA, since the assumptions for using parametric test were met in both cases (Kolmogorov\u2013 Smirnov to check for normal distribution and the Levene Test to calculate the variance equality for the independent means).", "The data for Hypothesis 5 (re: Freshmen\u2019s intragroup cognitive and metacognitive strategies), 6 (re: Tutors\u2019 cognitive and metacognitive strate-

hypotheses 1, 2, and 3, the respective U of Mann\u2013Whitney analyses for the freshmen treatment group on GPA, PR, and SR did not yield statistically significant differences at the end of the PTP, as compared to the results obtained by the freshmen control group (Table 1).", "As to Hypothesis 4, the results obtained after comparing the means of the freshmen\u2019s treatment and control groups in the post-test showed that the variable \u2018\u2018group\u2019\u2019 (i.e., treatment vs. control) yielded a statistically significant amount of variance (Lamda de Wilks = .83, p \\ .000).", "Using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov, it was ascertained that there was a normal distribution on both the pre-test and the post-test scores on the four Pozar\u2019s Study habits inventory (2002) scales on

Scales on cognitive and metacognitive strategies (Pozar 2002).", "Following, the t-student dependent test showed statistically significant differences between the treatment group\u2019s pre-test and

after obtaining a normal distribution from the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov the pre- and post-test on Social Skills Scale (Gismero 2000) scores on the five sub-scales, the t-student dependent test

cannot be studied using other types of questionnaires (e.g., academic performance and personal satisfaction with their program of study) (Topping 1996).", "More concretely, this study was designed to ascertain the useful- ness of the PTP\u2014a program designed to improve teaching and learning among freshmen and their tutors by focusing on concrete aspects of student development (e.g., independent learning, cognitive and metacognitive strategies, social skills).", "The conclusions of the study are the following: First, the PTP did not have a statistically significant impact on freshmen\u2019s GPA, PR, SR, and, hence, hypotheses 1, 2 and 3 could not be accepted.", "Second, by contrast, as a result of the PTP, there was a statistically significant difference between the freshmen\u2019s treatment and the control groups in some of their cognitive and metacog- nitive strategies (i.e., \u2018\u2018study planning\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018use of study materials\u2019\u2019); and, therefore, Hypothesis 4 can be partially accepted.", "Third, when compared to the pre-tests, the post- tests of the freshmen\u2019s treatment group indicated that the PTP did statistically significantly enhance cognitive and metacognitive strategies (i.e., \u2018\u2018contextual conditions of study\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018study planning\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018use of study

results ought to be interpreted not only considering the probability and statistical significance values (Goldschmid 1976); but, also, and perhaps more importantly, on the basis of the effect size (Coe and Merino 2003; Fr\u0131 \u0301as et al.", "2000; Glass et al.", "1981).", "In fact, the effect size allows one to reach more useful conclusions in relation to the potency of the results (Cohen 1988).", "In this sense, the values of the effect size in the dependent variables for hypotheses 1, 2, and 3 allow one to see that freshmen in the treatment group scored higher than 58% on GPA, PR and SR than their counterparts in the control group.", "Furthermore, bearing in mind Coe and Merino\u2019s (2003) suggestion that an effect size higher that .1 would constitute an already noteworthy improvement, the effect sizes obtained in this study for each of the aforementioned aspects (i.e., .18, .17, and .22, respectively) become quite remarkable, especially when taking into account the size of the effect accumulates over time (see also Glass, et al.", "1981; Keselman et al.", "1998; Ledesma et al.", "2008).", "Considering, furthermore, that PTP also had statistically significant effects on the treatment group\u2019s acquisition of \u2018\u2018cognitive and metacognitive strategies,\u2019\u2019 it could be affirmed that PTP did contribute to enhance academic success (Benavent and Fossati 1990; Ferna \u0301ndez et al.", "2003; Griffin and Griffin 1997; Higgins 2004; Lake 1999; Nestel and Kidd 2003; Topping 1996, 2005; Tuckman 2003; Xu et al.", "2001).", "These results are particularly relevant for Academic and Student Affairs professionals, since they can champion and consistently use this research-based innovative practice to improve critical current indicators of quality in higher education (e.g., course completion rates, success rates, student retention, graduation rates, student satisfaction, student per- sonal and professional development, and citizenship).", "We do also agree with Kuh (2009) that Academic and Student Affairs professionals could also take the lead in monitoring student participation in these and other high-impact educational activities, while working with academic administrators and faculty to find ways to create effective and efficient opportunities for students, especially for those who start college with two or more \u2018\u2018risk\u2019\u2019 factors (e.g., being academically underprepared, being the first in the family to go to college, or coming from low-income backgrounds).", "Moreover, the PTP

graduation.", "The PTP also proves to be useful regarding the recommendations of Goldschmid (1976), Schroeder (2004) and Whitt et al.", "(2008), in the sense that it capitalizes on existing human resources (i.e., students) at low or no cost and without extensive involvement of additional staff.", "Additionally, this study has demonstrated the usefulness of the PTP for the tutors, who, on their part, improved some of their cognitive and metacognitive strategies and social skills.", "In this regard, the present study can be considered to be a pioneering one because, although the data on the tutors stemmed only from a one-group pre-test/post-test design (Ato 1995; Campbell and Stanley 1963), and despite that these data are incidental or unintended outcomes of the study, they did indicate a variety of benefits of the PTP upon these veteran students (e.g., increasing their confidence in communicating and presenting, gaining additional experience in managing people, enhancing their curriculum vitas, improving their ability to manage at work-placement interviews).", "This is particularly relevant in a context where older students orient their careers toward teaching, either within the university (e.g., as teaching assistants, young professors, tutors) or outside of 123 784 High Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788 higher education (e.g., as school teachers, organization managers).", "In addition to com- pensating for some of their shortcomings in their academic and professional preparation (Kuh 2009), the PTP may have also provided them with value recognition and status among their younger peers, as well as contributed to the bettering of both the institutions\u2019 learning culture (Carter and McNeill 1998) and student success.", "Another aspect to consider in regard to the tutors is that their selection was based precisely on their already sophis- ticated level of cognitive and metacognitive strategies and social skills.", "As such, these levels may have produced a \u2018\u2018regression effect\u2019\u2019 in the sample (Campbell and Stanley 1963); notwithstanding this fact, the tutors did show an improvement on their post-test scores in some aspects of both Pozar\u2019s Study Habits Inventory (2002) and Gismero\u2019s Social Skills Scale (2000), a fact that, once again, may point to the usefulness of the PTP for these students.", "In view of this, it is reasonable to suggest that if institutional development is to begin to influence curriculum delivery, it will be necessary to reassess the role of higher education tutors as well as to reappraise the interrelatedness between what, in the past, have been considered to be separate areas (i.e., student guidance and the curriculum itself) (Carter and McNeill 1998).", "In this new scenario, the Academic Affairs and the Student Affairs units will have to draw upon examples of educational practices that include purposeful student- faculty contact; collaboration among faculty and staff; and active and collaborative peer- learning and peer-tutoring strategies in order to enhance their programs and provide appropriate services that engage students not only in the learning process, but also in the exercise of their rights and duties, as indicated in Article 46 of Spain\u2019s Organic Law of Universities (Ministerio de Educacio \u0301n, Cultura y Deporte 2001).", "Under these circumstances, it can be deemed logical to continue researching the pedagogical, psychological and social variables involved in the enhancement of teaching and learning within programs such as the PTP.", "Also, to extend what has been found in the present study, researchers may want to address the complexity of peer-tutoring programs employing more sophisticated experimental designs.", "For instance, researchers could investigate aspects such as the effects of peer-tutoring programs on student motivation, expectations, learning styles (Tinto 1993), or cultural norms (Guiffrida 2006), the effects of these programs over the long term (i.e., beyond one academic year), the particularities of the different learning dynamics students engage in depending on their filed of study or the type of subject matter studied (e.g., compulsory or elective, letters or sciences), and whether there exists a correlation between the improvements of the peer-tutors and those of their tutees, and in what areas.", "Also, to improve the measurement of the higher-level thinking and independent learning that academic tasks at the college level and to strength the learning skills intervention element of future peer-tutoring programs will require more sophisticated instruments\u2014instruments able to capture not only the type of cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies students use as self-regulatory processes (Kitsantas et al.", "2008), but also the complexity of the dynamic interactive systems students operate under (Phan 2010).", "In this regard, we remain committed to the notion of deliberately embedding the PTP within the institutional agenda as an intricate part of the education system so as to leverage significant institutional change concerning student success (Arco et al.", "2005).", "In sum, the overall results of the present study seem particularly relevant given the \u2018\u2018airs of change\u2019\u2019 affecting HE in Europe, where the Bologna Process recommends the devel- opment of certain student skills such as self-reflection, independent learning, and self- assessment (European University Association 2007).", "Terms such as \u2018\u2018student centredness\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018learner autonomy\u2019\u2019 may have little meaning to students entering HE; thus, these terms may need to be made explicit at the start of the study program.", "The emphasis here needs to 123 High Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788 785 placed be on how guidance at an early stage of a college program may foster the devel- opment of student autonomy (Carter and McNeill 1998).", "In this line, the PTP and its corresponding study could be taken as two examples of those \u2018\u2018best practices\u2019\u2019 recom- mended by the Spanish Network of University Quality Assurance Agencies (Red Espan \u0303ola de Agencias de Calidad Universitaria 2009).", "As such, both the PTP and this study could be very useful to Academic Affairs and Student Affairs professionals, as well as other stakeholders involved in warranting quality within the European Higher Education Area (e.g., those in charge of institutional quality issues, Deans and Vice-Chancellors, or institutional auditors such as those in the AUDIT Program set by the Spanish National Evaluation and Quality Insurance Agency).", "Moreover, we understand that the PTP and the present study contribute to the development of the internal systems of warranty quality, since they do clearly respond to one of the criteria set by the European National Quality Assurance (Vicerrectorado para la Garantia de la Calidad 2008).", "Finally, institutions of higher education aiming at building a body of evidence from which to demonstrate their effectiveness and their ability to meet accountability demands in order to obtain scarce resources and facilitate change may benefit considerably from creating, supporting and researching programs like the PTP.", "Acknowledgments

assists reflection on the writing process and improves the quality of texts, whether in first or foreign languages.", "This relates to, but is not part of, the current project.", "Collaborative review, as opposed to individual review, involves a greater degree of revision and changes in the text (Allal, 2000; Lindblom-Yla\u0308nne, Pihlajama\u0308ki, & Kotka, 2006) through viewing the text from another perspective (Yang, 2010).", "Again this relates to, but is not part of, the current project.", "Turning to factors that are part of the current study, Cassany (2002) points out that correcting the text of other students promotes self- regulation, provides opportunities for linguistic reflection and allows the teacher to focus on the writing process.", "Also, writing to communicate with a partner is not the same as writing for the teacher.", "Several authors (Camps, 2003; Cassany, 2002; Milian, 2003) agree that the sense of audience is inherent in peer practices and that writing is a process of social interaction and negotiation of meaning between writer and reader (Nystrand, 1989; Prior, 2006).", "Both of these were incorporated in the training provided for participants in this study.", "From a socio-cultural perspective, providing assistance within the zone of proximal development is a function of the collaboration (Wells, 1999) which underpins the effectiveness of peer review in the learning of L1, since the student who performs the tutor role (and is an expert in L1) should review the peer text and offer adjusted support including text correction to improve its quality.", "This process requires effort to clarify doubts and rework explanations, and is tailored by the tutor, requiring excellent tutor comprehension of the text.", "This supports the idea that in teaching their tutee, the tutor also learns (Cho & Cho, 2010; Cortese, 2005; Roscoe & Chi, 2007).", "On the other hand, the peer review also promotes L2 learning, because students acting as tutees rewrite the text based on the immediate feedback of the tutor, adapted to the tutee\u2019s needs (Min, 2006; Nelson & Schunn, 2009).", "However, not all peer review is equally effective (Gibbs & Simpson, 2004; Gielen, Peeters, Dochy, Onghena, & Struyven, 2010; Nelson & Schunn, 2009).", "Research in this area warns of the difficulties of some students in making objective assessments of their peers (Lindblom- Yla\u0308nne et al., 2006).", "Social aspects between pairs, especially those related to cultural knowledge, can also impede communication (Vinagre, 2005).", "It is therefore necessary to take into account the quality of aid or feedback (Liang, 2010; Nelson & Schunn, 2009).", "A review of studies on the quality of feedback (Topping, 2010) concludes that non-directive feedback is more effective for students with high skills, whereas more elaborate feedback might be suited to students with low abilities.", "Consequently, it highlights the importance of prior training of the tutors (Min, 2006).", "In summary, there is a need on the one hand for greater effort in tutor training to provide support for linguistic reflection, and on the other to analyze the different types of feedback offered and their relation to the improvement of language competence in both languages.", "In the present investigation tutors were trained to note errors and provide suggestive but not directive error correction for the tutee, who then thought about the issue, developed their own response to the problem and corrected the error themself \u2013 hopefully learning by succeeding.", "Peer tutors were to avoid giving the answer or solution directly.", "Instead they offered assistance requiring the active participation of the tutee, such as merely marking the error or more assertively marking the error and giving a clue (by reminding, questioning, explaining or modeling).", "Finally, it was considered important to give encouragement to the partner for their progress and efforts in the proper use of the second language.", "3.", "Objectives and research questions The objective of this research was to analyze whether reciprocal peer

"Second, the study preceding the present study used a control group and demonstrated effectiveness in the intervention group compared to the controls (Duran et al., 2010).", "Finally, in this case we were principally interested in the relationship between pupil outcomes and the nature of the interaction.", "Regarding the interactive process within pairs, we considered three variables: types of errors detected, level of feedback offered and the tutee\u2019s response to the correction of the tutor.", "Considering types of errors detected, errors were categorized according to morphosyntax (articles and conjunctions, punctuation, verbs, gender and number, word order, prepositions, and pronouns), spelling (according to Go\u0301mez, 2002 - letters, initials and syllables) and vocabulary (appropriate use of vocabulary).", "Considering level of feedback offered by the tutor, we used seven categories, each graded from the highest to lowest level: 1) Mark the error, give the correct answer and an explanation, 2) Mark the error and give the correct answer, 3) Mark the error and offer an explanation that helps the tutee to correct the error, 4) Mark the error and offer some hint(s) and prompt(s) to help the tutor to correct the error, 5) Mark the error, 6) Prompt, 7) Ask questions, and 7) Praise effort and improvement.", "Finally, considering the tutee\u2019s response to the

Johnson signed the Higher Education Act to provide funds for low-income families sending their children to college.", "In a speech made by President Johnson related to the passage of this Act, he informed the audience to convey to young people that if they worked hard, college could be a reality (Johnson, 1965).", "While attending higher education institutions may be possible as a result of this Act, success within these institutions may be more challenging for first-generation college students.", "Some of the difficulties not addressed by the Higher Education Act are evident in graduation rates.", "While first-generation college students now represent a larger portion of the undergraduate student population (Engle & Tinto, 2008; Berkner & Choy, 2008), this at-risk group will graduate at a lower rate than their college peers.", "The National Center for Education Statistics estimates that from the number of students enrolled in post-secondary institutions, 27% are dependents of their parents and 58% are independent first-generation college students PREVIEW PEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS 3 (Berkner & Choy, 2008).", "Despite representing a large portion of the undergraduate student population, only 26% will earn Bachelor\u2019s degrees as compared to 68% of their peers whose parents went to college (Chen, 2005; Engle et al., 2006).", "First-generation college students are considered at-risk for degree completion for a number of reasons (Vivian, 2005).", "According to Vivian (2005), first-generation college students \u201cmay be educationally underprepared, have greater financial constraints, and have less social and familial support than other students\u201d (p. 338).", "Because first-generation college students begin their studies with greater academic and social needs as compared to their peers whose parents graduated from college, these needs may prevent them from graduating (Vivian, 2005).", "First-generation college students have been found less academically prepared for their college experiences (Engle et al., 2006; Thayer, 2000).", "First-generation college students often take less challenging high school courses (Thayer, 2000).", "College students who completed advanced high school courses, such as rigorous math courses, increased the likelihood that they would enroll in a baccalaureate college and complete their degree (Chen, 2005; Choy, 2001; Horn & Nunez, 2000); however, many first-generation college students may be less academically prepared for college compared to their peers (Engle et al., 2006; Thayer, 2000).", "Furthermore, first-generation college students often may not attempt to take academic risks or put forth great effort because their level of self-efficacy is lower, compared to non-first-generation college students (Ramos-Sanchez & Nichols, 2007).", "Many first-generation college students are from low-income families, placing them at greater risk for attrition (Corrigan, 2003; Engle et al., 2006).", "First-generation college students often lack the financial resources from their families to sustain their education (Thayer, 2000).", "Therefore, first-generation college students tend to devote more time to working while attending PREVIEW PEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS 4 college.", "The need to maintain income contributes to the challenges they encounter to persist and succeed in higher education (Corrigan, 2003).", "Not only does working more reduce the amount of time available to study, but it also impacts the amount of time first-generation college students have to interact with college peers (Pascerella, Pierson, Wolniak, & Terrenzini, 2004).", "First-generation college students may receive less encouragement from their families to prepare for or to attend college (Pascerella et al., 2004).", "Because parents of first-generation college students did not attend college or have experience with the college system, they are less likely to know how to pay for college expenses (Choy, 2001).", "Moreover, first-generation college students\u2019 parents are often unable to direct their children about how to develop a plan to receive the help that they need within the academic experience, which may result in their children\u2019s lack of cultural capital, which is a form of capital comprised of the skills and knowledge to make the educational experience beneficial and influential (Pascerella et al., 2004).", "In addition, these parents may not know how to direct their children to properly access essential resources on campus, resulting in their lack of social capital.", "According to Thayer (2000), social capital provides supportive resources to make a smooth transition for college students to earn a degree.", "Both social and cultural capital have been found to support the undergraduate student population\u2019s completion of a bachelor\u2019s degree (Pascerella et al., 2004).", "Problem Statement According to Warburton, Bugarin, and Nunez (2001), \u201cFirst-generation students were less likely than their peers whose parents had a bachelor\u2019s degree to be enrolled at their initial institution 3 years later and to stay on the persistence track to a bachelor\u2019s degree\u201d PREVIEW PEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS 5 (p. 45).", "The intent of this study was to learn how academic support from nationally certified peer tutoring programs, specifically CRLA, may benefit this population with their persistence, success, and retention at four year colleges and one community college.", "Some of the difficulty that first-generation college students encounter results from a lack of strong academic preparation when compared to their college peers (Engle et al., 2006).", "Pike and Kuh (2005) found that first-generation college students are less likely to spend time studying or engaging in dialogue with their peers regarding academic work.", "While previous studies have researched peer involvement in college, especially for first-generation college students, as a beneficial way for students to learn how to succeed academically, according to Pascerella et al.", "(2004), there is a gap related to research on the efficacy of the peer tutoring training.", "This study explores three nationally certified peer tutoring programs as forms of support that may enable these students to graduate with a baccalaureate degree because the tutoring programs encourage regular study time and dialogue within peers about academics.", "Research Question The central question guiding this study was: How does participation in a peer tutoring program certified by the College Reading and Learning Association (CRLA) influence the experience of first-generation college students at either the baccalaureate or associate level?", "The sub questions were: \uf0b7 What academic skills and strategies do first-generation college students develop as a result of participation in the peer tutoring program?", "\uf0b7 What types of social benefits are realized by first-generation college students as a result of participation in the peer tutoring program?", "\uf0b7 What components of the peer tutoring program do students perceive as most beneficial?", "\uf0b7 What components of the peer tutoring program do students perceive as least beneficial?", "PREVIEW PEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS 6 Purpose of the Study The purpose of this qualitative multi-case study was to explore the experiences of first- generation college students participating in a nationally certified peer tutoring program.", "The intent of this study was to better understand the benefits, if any, and perceptions of participating undergraduate students.", "The purpose was accomplished through an exploration using interviews, observations, and documents of the peer tutoring program in which they are participating.", "The design enabled the researcher to listen and learn about the participants\u2019 experiences, as well as those of the peer tutors\u2019 and program coordinators\u2019 through interviews.", "Observations of peer tutoring sessions and a review of the tutoring programs\u2019 documents were used as additional data collection methods.", "The result was an in-depth review of each program using within-case and cross-case analysis guided by a system of inductive inquiry to generate patterns of meanings and themes related to peer tutoring at the selected institutions and the experiences of first-generation college students participating in those programs (Merriam, 2009).", "The findings of this study can build upon the scholarly literature related to first-generation college students and inform student services practitioners who provide academic support to first-generation college students.", "Theoretical Framework The theoretical framework for this study was based upon three interrelated student development theories that are foundational to the field.", "The first of those theories related to the seminal research on student retention was by Tinto (1975, 1987).", "The second theory was based on the classic researcher of Astin (1984), whose work was related to the implications of student interactions with their peers.", "The final student development theory framing this study was based on the seven principles for good practice in undergraduate education as identified by Chickering and Gamson (1987).", "PREVIEW PEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS 7 Tinto\u2019s (1987) theory of retention related to the combination of academic and social integration as students become accustomed to and persist in their academic careers at a university.", "Academic integration occurs when students are achieving in their classes, while social integration refers to students developing a sense of belonging and bonding with their peers for both academic and social reasons (Braxton, 2000).", "Both social and academic integration contribute to the success of college students (Tinto, 1987).", "Chickering and Gamson\u2019s (1987) seven principles for good practice in undergraduate school included: (a) encouragement of student-faculty, (b) encouragement of cooperation, (c) encouragement of active learning, (d) prompt feedback, (e) time on task, (f) communication of high expectations, and (g) respect for diverse talents and ways of knowing.", "By combining the social and academic concerns for college students, Chickering and Gamson (1987) identified the important role that academic support service personnel provide for students to be successful in higher education.", "Chickering and Gamson\u2019s (1987) principles for good practice outlined characteristics that a peer tutoring program can incorporate, such as having tutors encourage contact and cooperation among students, promote active learning on campus, and provide prompt feedback on student learning (Boylan, 2002).", "Student development theories provide many student service professionals on campuses with a better foundation to better meet the needs of a growing and diverse student population, such as first-generation college students (Engle & Tinto, 2008).", "These theories can help college administrators understand students\u2019 personal development and academic growth, as well as how students are connected.", "By using these theories to help guide this ongoing study and the analysis of the data, new strategies may be revealed so that college administrators and support service providers can better meet the needs of first-generation college students.", "PREVIEW PEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS 8 Delimitations Tutoring programs were limited to those having national certification from CRLA.", "This decision was based on the work of Maxwell (1990), who wrote about the benefits of peer tutoring programs that adhered to standards and guidelines established by CRLA.", "Higbee (2009) referred to Maxwell, \u201cas a pioneer in the field of learning assistance and developmental education\u201d (p.1).", "Maxwell (1990) stated that, \u201cA well trained tutor can serve a vital role in helping fellow students attain their academic goals\u201d (p. 1); therefore, training topics with peer tutors was one focus of the study.", "Another area of focus was to observe how well peer tutors modeled or demonstrated problem solving strategies to their students.", "Bandura (1997) found that when a person observed someone complete a task through modeling of the task it helped to increase the person\u2019s self- efficacy.", "The decision to focus on selected colleges with nationally accredited programs was purposeful to ensure that comparable sites comprised each case.", "The criteria for the site selection were colleges that had full-time undergraduate students, some whom were first- generation college students.", "These institutions must also have an active and CRLA accredited peer tutoring program.", "To capture the context of the participants\u2019 experiences, the number of participants was limited to a student population that met the criteria set through purposive sampling.", "Participants were limited to those undergraduates who are first-generation college students and participated in the peer tutoring program.", "The participants were limited to students who were pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree.", "PREVIEW PEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS 9 Significance of the Study The significance of this study is its potential benefit to student service practices, delivering peer tutoring to first-generation college students.", "The quality and type of academic support services related to peer tutoring are an important component to ensure the retention and success of the first-generation college students.", "According to Williams and Butler (2010), \u201cIt is critical for college administrators and practitioners to help these students to identify, understand, and develop coping skills to help resolve their unique stressors\u201d (p. 4).", "This study may lead to a better understanding of one of these academic support services, which can advance the knowledge of student service personnel.", "This knowledge can also contribute to a greater understanding of first-generation college students and

long tradition whose beginnings can be traced back to the ancient Greeks (Topping, 1996).", "There are various forms of peer tutoring and different reasons to practice this method, which results in the fact that there is no consistent definition for it in literature.", "On the one hand, for instance, peer tutoring programs were implemented during the Industrial Revolution in England to compensate for the shortage of CROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY 1041 teachers.", "On the other hand, peer tutoring is also used in order to give older children responsibility for younger ones (Fogarty & Wang, 1982).", "Evidently, the widespread practice of supporting low-achieving students through private tutoring can also be considered a form of peer tutoring.", "For our project, we need a modern definition of peer tutoring which considers the full range of aspects taking place during the tutoring process and therefore use Topping (2005): \u201cIt involves people from similar social groupings who are not professional teachers helping each other to learn and learning themselves by so doing\u201d (p. 631).", "This definition already indicates a shift of the research focus from tutees toward tutors.", "To distinguish between peer and cross-age tutoring, we use the following definition according to Gaustad (1993): \u201cPeer tutoring occurs when tutor and tutee are at the same age whereas in cross-age peer tutoring the tutor is older than the tutee\u201d (p. 1).", "Gaustad, however, does not mention how much older the tutors should be and whether the age corresponds to the school grade.", "The study by Robinson (2005) recommends that the age gap between tutors and tutees should not be too large because their interaction is based on friendship which is closer than the relationship between a teacher and a student.", "Sometimes the term peer tutoring is used parallel to the broader term peer-assisted learning for both cross-age and same-age tutoring in literature (Robinson et al., 2005).", "In our study, we use the term cross-age peer tutoring to emphasize that tutors and tutees differ in grade level but belong to similar social groups concerning type of school and social background.", "Research Results About Cross-Age Peer Tutoring Previous (meta-)studies on peer tutoring cover a large scale of different settings, different grades, and different subject matters and investigate either academic, attitudinal, or socioemotional outcomes.", "An early meta- analysis conducted by Cohen et al.", "(1982) compared 65 different studies with different foci using effect sizes.", "They emphasized positive effects concerning students\u2019 achievements, attitudes toward the subject matter, and self-concepts not only for the tutoring students, but for

information given about demographic and interventional parameters such as academic level or gender composition in some of their reviewed studies.", "There is another older study (Fogarty & Wang, 1982)

matters remedial math and computer literacy with elementary-level students as tutees and interme- diate-level students as tutors.", "The authors concluded that the success of cross-age peer tutoring is based on a give-and-take friendship and therefore qualitatively different from that of a teacher\u2013student interaction.", "In his review of literature, Topping (1996) reports on the effectiveness of peer tutoring in further and higher education.", "In a summary about trends in peer learning (Topping, 2005), he emphasizes that results are typically very good if peer tutoring is well organized and implemented with focus on appropriate contexts.", "Then, even in the case of classwide tutoring, both tutors and tutees can improve their achievement.", "An independent approach to

mentioned above give some implications for tutoring programs concerning age level, duration, or target group.", "In addition to that, though tutoring programs were originally understood to support the tutees\u2019 achievement, they have even more positive effects on the tutors\u2019 learning outcomes, which is emphasized by several studies (Fogarty & Wang, 1982; Robinson et al., 2005; Topping, 1996).", "Robinson et al.", "(2005) discussed some more useful implications for the development of tutoring programs: Peer-assisted learning is a useful method to enhance both achievement in mathematics and attitudinal outcomes and need not be limited to high-achieving students as tutors.", "A combination of the roles of both tutor and tutee should be strongly considered.", "Concerning the tutor\u2013tutee combination, the age gap should be modest to maximize the benefit for both groups.", "Single-sex tutoring dyads should also be considered.", "Fogarty and Wang (1982) emphasized the necessity of prior tutor training because of the tutors\u2019 limited instructional repertoire in the case of new contents.", "Conceptual Change and Students\u2019 Conceptions A unique situation is encountered with science education research and teaching: The students already have preinstructional conceptions in their minds, which originate from everyday life and language often labeled as students\u2019 conceptions (Duit, 2009; Wandersee, Mintzes, & Novak, 1994).", "They are partly contradictory to scientific conceptions and thus have to be fundamentally restructured during the learning process.", "This conceptual change has great influence on the way science is supposed to be taught.", "Conceptual change is not facilitated by just making students aware of their preinstructional conceptions, for they are usually very stable (Duit, Treagust, & Widodo, 2008).", "The best known approach to conceptual change is from Strike and Posner (1992) who claim four conditions that to facilitate this change: students\u2019 need to be fulfilled in order dissatisfaction with their prior concepts and a replacement conception which is intelligible, plausible, and fruitful (Duit & Treagust, 2003).", "1044 KORNER & HOPF Therefore, it is necessary to create appropriate learning settings which support conceptual change in order to enable students to actively construct knowledge within the scope of the constructivist learning theory (Reusser, 2001).", "In their research about peer collaboration in physics Howe et al.", "(1995) report that peer tutoring facilitates conceptual change in the context of heating and cooling and can therefore be seen as an appropriate environment setting in the sense of Reusser (see above).", "RESEARCH QUESTIONS During the past few decades, a lot of research has been done on peer tutoring and other methods of cooperative learning (Treagust, 2007) with regard to various topics and different age groups.", "Although there are several studies about peer tutoring, there is one question that has not been sufficiently answered by recent research: Is this method also effective in the context of teaching physics?", "The answer to this question is not obvious because instruction in physics requires specific features in order to facilitate conceptual change on the basis of a constructivist learning theory.", "The abovementioned (meta-)studies deal with many different subjects, such as mathematics, reading, or computer literacy.", "Science topics are hardly covered explicitly in any study except that of Howe et al.", "(1995).", "Duit et al.", "(2008) propose that, based on a multi-perspective conceptual change approach, self-guided learning strategies support constructivist-oriented learning in science in a more suitable way than the traditional teacher-oriented instructional practice.", "This can be seen as an argument for the effectiveness of cross-age peer tutoring in the context of physics.", "Therefore, this study examines the achievement in the tested contexts in order to draw possible conclusions for the effectiveness of cross-age peer tutoring.", "However, caution should be exercised because tutees might possibly adopt their tutor\u2019s misconceptions.", "Consequently, these misconceptions might be even more ingrained.", "Furthermore, there are few studies which examine secondary-level students in the context of peer-assisted learning.", "Robinson\u2019s meta-study (Robinson et al., 2005), as well as Rohrbeck\u2019s meta-study (Rohrbeck, et al., 2003), describe predominantly U.S. minority and at-risk students.", "Additionally, Rohrbeck claims that peer-tutoring interventions were more effective with younger elementary school students.", "Therefore, it is left open whether this method is appropriate in the European cultural context as well as for secondary-level students.", "One of the implications made in Robinson\u2019s study was to take into account that tutoring programs have CROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY 1045 positive academic outcomes for tutors as well.", "Accordingly, not only the tutees\u2019, but also the tutors\u2019, achievement has became one of our research goals.", "The present study focuses on electricity because, according to the Austrian curricula, this topic is relevant for all of the participating classes.", "Also, students\u2019 preconceptions in electricity are well-known (Stork & Wiesner, 1981) and research on conceptual change teaches us to focus on specific conceptions.", "Thus, this study was guided by the following research questions: Research Question 1: What Is the Achievement in Electricity for Secondary- Level Students According to Cross-Age Peer Tutoring?", "This investigation aims to find evidence whether or not cross-age peer tutoring is an appropriate method for teaching electricity to secondary- level students who are rarely covered by previous studies.", "The tested hypothesis is that an achievement in electricity can be observed for all secondary-level students within the context of electricity.", "Research Question 2: Is There an Increased Achievement in Electricity for Tutors?", "Older studies have reported that there is a considerable benefit not only tor tutees but also for those students who act as tutors (Cohen et al., 1982; Fogarty & Wang, 1982; Topping,

Description of the Sample This study was conducted in Austrian schools in and around Vienna within the context of a larger project on Cross-Age Peer Tutoring in Physics (CAPT).", "For the whole project, the age of the children and students ranged from 5 years (kindergarten) up to 17 years (upper secondary level).", "According to the research questions, in this study, we confined ourselves to students aged 11 to 14 years, which corresponds with grades 5 to 8.", "This restriction results in a total sample size of n=172 students investigated.", "The questionnaires used were optimized for this specific age group.", "The grade level for the tutors was 6 to 8 (ages 12 to 14) and that of the tutees was 2 to 7 (ages 8 to 13) resulting in an average age gap of 2.82 years and a standard deviation of 1.99.", "In two cases, the age gap was 0 years (same-age tutoring, but different types of schools), and in one case, when tutees were in kindergarten, it was 6 years.", "According to Robinson et al.", "(2005) and Fogarty & Wang (1982), the age gap between tutors and tutees should not be too large, which is the case in most situations.", "Beyond that, hardly anything is found in previous studies about the influence of the age gap.", "A gap of 0 years, which means same- age tutoring, at most reduces the observed effect sizes (Hattie, 2009) but does not bias the analyses in any other way.1 Due to organizational reasons, it was not possible to draw a more homogenous sample.", "Therefore, the circumstances of the project made it necessary to conduct a field study.", "The analyses of the pretests showed that, based on this sample, it was still possible to answer the research questions because these tests did not CROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY 1047 vary significantly over all participating classes.", "The focus on lower- secondary-level students was chosen because the sample size of upper secondary-level students was too small.", "The most important criterion that participating classes had to meet was that cross-age peer tutoring could be accomplished without too much organizational effort.", "Thus, four schools were selected in which different types of schools were located within the same building.", "Besides this criterion, the four schools were chosen in order to get the most representative sample possible.", "School 1 is a private school in the center of Vienna, attended by hardly any students with migration background; the second one is a public school, located also in the center of Vienna, with classes of up to 90 % students with migration background, according to the definition of OECD (Breit, 2009).", "The third one is a private school as well, but is located at the periphery of the city.", "The participating teachers of all three schools were involved in the training of the preservice teachers.", "The fourth school is situated in a more rural environment, 20 km outside of Vienna.", "All in all, there were seven urban classes and six rural classes.", "However, we tried to include different types of schools with different sociocultural backgrounds.", "The reader can claim that the sample is biased because of the overrepresentation of private schools, but we would like to mention that, in Austria, all schools follow the same curriculum and all teachers, in private as well as in public schools, are equally paid by the community.", "Most of the classes chosen for this study belonged to a type of compulsory school which qualifies their students for a job rather than for higher education such as colleges and universities.", "Therefore, the attending students\u2019 abilities in science, mathematics, and reading are significantly below the mean for this age group (OECD, 2010).", "Although there is evidence found in literature, as reported above, that cross-age peer tutoring works in various situations, it might be different and more difficult when trying to induce conceptual change.", "If it is possible that cross-age peer tutoring enhances the achievement and thus initiates a conceptual change in the tested low-achieving population, it is likely to work even better for different populations of higher-achieving students.", "All students tested and monitored, as well as their parents, had given their informed written consent.", "Subject Matter Following Zinn (2009), we based the interventions on fixed learning contents.", "According to literature (Duit & Rho\u0308neck, 1998; Shipstone, 1984), we selected basic topics within the context of electricity.", "The 1048 KORNER & HOPF

as if I was teaching someone who didn\u2019t know anything.", "(T10) [Normal revision] would be more largely based on memorizing facts and regurgitating them.", "(T6) Hence, preparation to teach may enable active learning (Benware and Deci 1984) and strategies based upon knowledge-building and transformation rather than just recall (Topping 1998; Roscoe and Chi 2007), something confirmed by examination of wiki transcripts.", "The following strategies were associated with \u201cnormal\u201d revision, includ- ing memorisation of content, identification of key words, simplification and comple- tion of past papers.", "By contrast, tutors reported that preparing to tutor involved diagrams, simplification of concepts, fun, interest, visualisation of ideas, identification of the main points, progression of ideas, building ideas from fundamentals and avoid- ance of confusing terms.", "These descriptors were used to help support and structure interviews and paired discussions.", "Tutors recognised the need to seek out books to help focus on key points and essential information: I looked in the GCSE revision book, like for stuff they need to know, and then I started to think about how I could change it and put it in a way that would be easy to remember.", "(T6) I looked in my AS revision guide and notes, I have a CGP revision guide and just went through trying to take out the key points.", "(T9) Using books at the tutees\u2019 level helped tutors reorganise the lesson material into a format more easily understood.", "This helped tutors to revisit more fundamental concepts; for example: It reminded me of the stuff that we did in the beginning ... things I had forgotten.", "You know.", "The simple stuff.", "(T6) I just looked at the simpler information and it helped me to understand some of the other stuff, like the stuff later on.", "(T5) Engaging with the ideas from the tutee\u2019s perspective also appeared to inform the design and preparation of resources to be used during tutoring: I think it helps to see the information in the way that they need to know it; it helped to make the questions.", "(T10) In this case the tutor is referring to questions to discuss with tutees, and the need to interpret information in a different way to devise questions, a process which could lead to a \u201creorganisation\u201d of their own understanding (Webb 1982;

shortage of detailed analyses regarding how this knowledge often conflicts with learner percep- tions, textual/artifactual resources, and other sources of information about the language.", "One way to articulate these differences is through analyzing particular peer tutoring cases and how knowledge is enacted therein.", "In this article I combine a case study approach with a close discourse

interact with more competent speakers of a target language, enabled learners to \u201cestablish a legitimate positioning for themselves\u201d within the target culture (p. 106).", "Drawing further upon the notion of legitimate peripheral partici- pation, Young and Miller (2004, p. 521) discussed how one English language learner\u2013tutor cohort evolved with respect to their participation in \u201crevi- sion talk,\u201d with the learner gaining greater owner- ship of both the interaction and the revision pro- cess.", "East et al., (2012) discovered that students of Spanish in New Zealand reacted much more positively to the language and the classroom set- ting when they were able to participate in online reciprocal peer tutoring with English language learners in Colombia.", "Further psychological ben- efits of peer tutoring include findings by Gisbert and Font (2008), who demonstrated that English language learners showed improvements in self- concept and self-esteem with respect to their abil- ities in English after interactions with peer tutors.", "Logistical benefits to peer tutoring were also dis- covered; Huong (2007) noted how the presence of a more knowledgeable peer paved the way for briefer task negotiation, allowing learners to focus more on the content of the lesson.", "Despite these benefits, other researchers have the peer tutoring context often argued that leads to imbalanced exchanges, leaving little opportunity for learner interaction.", "For example, Trimbur (1987) showed that peer tutors talked twice as much as learners and asked more closed questions, in this way restricting learner involve- ment.", "Thonus (2004), in a review of peer tutoring studies, noted that most findings pointed to peer tutors using longer turn lengths, an increased use of directives, and a \u2018take charge\u2019 approach relative to the learner.", "Jones et al.", "(2006), in a comparison of online versus face-to-face peer tutoring, found that an online context was more egalitarian and addressed more global issues for the very reasons raised by Trimbur (1987) and Thonus (2004).", "Finally, Waring (2005) showed that peer tutoring settings could create a \u201cpattern The Modern Language Journal 100 (2016) of resistance\u201d due to differing identity claims and competing notions of expertise (p. 141).", "It appears, therefore, that although peer tu- toring offers the potential for increasing learner participation, the problems described previously can inhibit these benefits.", "One possible reason for issues such as peer tutor dominance is a lack of training; even though training has been deemed essential for the incorporation of ap- propriate tutoring behaviors (Fuchs et al., 1994; Thurston et al., 2009), peer tutor training varies widely among institutions and language depart- ments.", "For example, although the peer tutor in the current study received written materials to as- sist with oral participation exercises, she had re- ceived no explicit training on how to use these ma- terials.", "A lack of training often leads peer tutors to adopt a less interactive approach, utilizing strate- gies such as closed questions and longer times at talk (Thurston et al., 2009).", "In further examining the disadvantages of peer tutoring raised by prior studies, what stands out is an overarching concern with perceived peer tu- tor expertise, indicated by what researchers have termed a more \u2018teacherly\u2019 or \u2018take charge\u2019 atti- tude.", "Thonus (2004) outlined how learners ex- pect tutors to behave as \u201chigher status interlocu- tors\u201d (p. 235), while both Henning (2001) and Thonus (2002) noted the disconnect between the perception of a tutor as more \u201cpeer-like\u201d and per- ceived tutorial success.", "Peer tutors come from a variety of different sociolinguistic backgrounds, yet their position as tutors often leads to an as- sumption that they are experts in all of the vari- eties and registers of the language taught in the classroom.", "Yet, to date, little has been done to unpack the reasons underlying this perception of peer tutors as unreserved experts.", "One of these reasons could be the categoriza- tion of peer tutors before they even engage in interactions with learners.", "Supervisors and re- searchers alike frequently group peer tutors into essentialized categories such as \u2018native speaker,\u2019 despite the problematic nature of this catego- rization (e.g., Ferna\u0301ndez\u2013Dobao, 2012; Thonus, 2004; Thorne, 2003).", "Creese, Blackledge, and Takhi (2014) noted that the \u2018native speaker\u2019 la- bel \u201cautomatically endows one with a high level of competence in all domains of one\u2019s first lan- guage\u201d (p. 938).", "Yet critiques of the native speaker label abound in second language acquisition (SLA) literature, ranging from its inability to take into account multilingual interaction (Cook, 1999; Firth & Wagner, 1997; Llurda, 2009), to its glossing over of the complex interplay between language skills and allegiance to a particular Michele Back culture (Leung, Harris, & Rampton, 1997).", "More- over, the term \u2018native speaker\u2019 is rarely defined in these studies, and it is up to the reader to deter- mine what, precisely, these interlocutors can and cannot do with the language.", "Even when native speakers are described in more detail in the peer tutoring literature, they are still positioned unreservedly as experts in the variety and register of the language being taught, with no attempt to distinguish between the types of knowledge they might possess and how that might affect their negotiations with learners (for an important exception, see Weigle & Nelson, 2004).", "This type of positioning not only fails to account for the differences in knowledge that im- pact the process of negotiating meaning, but also ignores the personal histories, symbols, and com- plexities that each speaker of a language brings to any given interaction.", "As Thorne and Heller- mann (2015) asserted, \u201cheterogeneity of exper- tise is a commonplace dimension of the human experience\u201d (p. 282), a fact that is not readily ac- knowledged in most research on peer tutoring.", "Rather than using static categories such as \u2018na- tive speaker,\u2019 many scholars have suggested recon- ceiving this notion as a context-sensitive, interac- tional achievement (Doerr, 2009; Egbert, 2004; Firth & Wagner, 1997; Kubota, 2009; Piller, 2002) that views language as symbolic and contextual (Kramsch, 2009; Song & Kellogg, 2011).", "This out- look supports the use of a case study approach in order to examine in detail the particular episodes in which an expert or native speaker identity may or may not be constructed, as well as the symbols and contexts realized in each interaction.", "Fur- thermore, this approach parallels ethnomethod- ological and linguistic anthropological notions of knowledge and expertise, incorporating impor- tant elements such as interaction, ideology, and socialization.", "An outline of these notions follows in the next section.", "EPISTEMICS, EXPERTISE, AND PEER TUTORING INTERACTION Unlike the essentialized portrayals of knowl- edge in much of the research on peer tutor- ing, ethnomethodological approaches to epis- temics highlight its highly interactional nature, noting that territories of information claimed by interlocutors can overlap and shift depend- ing on context and area of knowledge (Kamio, 1997).", "These territories are often negotiated through mediation, a dialogically constructed, socio-interactional achievement in which inter- actants work together to resolve troubles of un- 511 derstanding (Pekarek Doehler, 2002; Poehner, 2008).", "This type of work may also incorporate what Thorne (2003) and others have termed \u201cme- diational artifacts,\u201d such as written texts or Inter- net search engines (p. 39).", "Heritage (2012) highlighted the interactional nature of epistemics by differentiating between epistemic status (the relative access to these terri- tories by interlocutors) and epistemic stance (how this access to knowledge is expressed moment to moment), noting that epistemic status \u201ccan be al- tered from moment to moment as a result of spe- cific interactional contributions\u201d (p. 4).", "These ex- pressions may include linguistic resources such as boosters (\u201ccertainly\u201d) and hedges (\u201cmaybe\u201d), which serve to confirm and downplay, respec- tively, a speaker\u2019s epistemic status.", "As mentioned previously, other resources for mediating knowl- edge may be artifactual, such as the incorporation of technology or texts; or embodied, including hand gestures, gaze direction, or shaking one\u2019s head (Belhiah, 2009; Sert & Walsh, 2013).", "The notion of epistemic status highlights how expressions of stance can index not only the knowledge in question, but also the \u201crights to possess and articulate it\u201d (Heritage, 2012, p. 5).", "The hierarchical and ideological aspects of epis- temics are further outlined from a linguistic an- thropological perspective in Summerson Carr\u2019s (2010) discussion of expertise.", "Summerson Carr saw expertise as \u201cinherently interactional,\u201d not unlike the notion of epistemics (p. 18).", "Indi- viduals in positions of expertise often acquire what Matoesian (1999) and Summerson Carr (2010) termed \u201cmastery of verbal performance,\u201d including the use of language \u201cto index and therefore instantiate already existing inner states of knowledge\u201d (p. 19).", "This performance in- cludes the mastery of certain verbal registers, as well as nonverbal signs, through an extensive process of socialization, evaluation, and institu- tionalization.", "Socialization practices that transmit expertise can include role-playing exercises, sim- ilar to those found in Motivational Interview- ing (Summerson Carr, 2010) or among ma- gicians\u2019 apprentices (Jones & Shweder, 2003), or the observation\u2013internalization\u2013imitation se- quence used with Mexicano woodcarvers\u2019 ap- prentices (Briggs, 1986), preservice teachers, and other apprenticeship relationships.", "However, as I have mentioned previously, many peer tutors have not been trained in tutoring methods; nor, as speakers of a particular language variety, have they necessarily been socialized into the expression of other varieties.", "Because of this, peer tutors frequently lack the master or 512 these repertoires, as well expert registers of as knowledge about how to transmit them to students.", "Thus, their own requests for informa- tion during a peer tutoring session cannot be treated as teacher-centered \u2018known answer\u2019 or display questions.", "In fact, a tutor\u2019s request for information may be viewed as evidence of what Heritage (2013) termed K\u2212 (knowledge minus) relative to the peer learner, and could be poten- tially face-threatening for the tutor.", "Given that expertise is \u201calways subject to public evaluation\u201d (Summerson Carr, 2010, p. 21), the negotiation of a peer tutor\u2019s epistemic status of K+ requires ongoing co-construction of this status by both the tutor and the learner.", "The interactional and ideological nature of the- ories on epistemics and expertise paves the way for a context-focused approach to interactions re- garding peer tutor knowledge.", "In the analysis of the data to follow, I focus on epistemic search se- quences (ESSs) for lexical items.", "As described in Jakonen & Morton (2015), ESSs are collective res- olutions of knowledge gaps.", "I limit my analysis to lexical items because they are usually more eas- ily resolved (e.g., with a translation or circum- locution) compared to morphological or syntac- tic items, which often result in more extensive and explicit grammatical explanations.", "For this reason, lexical ESSs unknown to the tutor could present more of a challenge to a tutor\u2019s epistemic status, due to their inability to answer as quickly as to a known lexical item.", "Here, I present a brief example of a lexical ESS that was successfully resolved by the peer tu- tor.", "(See the Appendix for transcription conven- tions.)", "EXCERPT 1:

addressed by Lorena.", "Instead, Lorena used an explanation (\u201cventajas es algo bueno\u201d), an The Modern Language Journal 100 (2016) English translation (\u201cplus\u201d \u201cthe pros\u201d),

distinguish between resolved, un- resolved, and semi-resolved ESSs.", "The distinction of resolved versus unresolved parallels Jakonen and Morton\u2019s (2015) response types in ESSs, in which resolved sequences are interactions in which a \u201cknowing\u201d response is accepted, and unresolved sequences are interactions with an \u201cunknowing\u201d response, or in which the search is not taken up.", "To this framework I add a third category, semi- resolved, which indicates that a knowing response has been accepted, but that there is some doubt on the part of the tutor regarding its accuracy, as evidenced by the use of mitigations.", "The examination of the three ESSs to follow uses a close discourse analysis to outline, turn by turn, how these ESSs were negotiated in inter- action, as well as how participants aligned to tu- tor and learner constructions of expertise.", "Before this, I provide additional contextual information on the participants and the peer tutoring setting.", "SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS The data from this study come from a larger data set of peer tutoring sessions from the Span- ish department of a mid-sized public university in southern California.", "At the time of the study, approximately 30% of the undergraduate stu- dents at the university identified as Hispanic or Latino.", "Many of these students decided to ma- jor in Spanish, or had close contacts with other Spanish majors.", "Given this rich group of poten- tial tutors, and given a lack of resources for de- veloping a language laboratory, the department created a peer tutoring program for beginning Spanish speakers to practice their oral commu- nication skills with what the department labeled \u2018native\u2019 Spanish speakers, generally self-identified Hispanic/Latino junior or senior year students.", "The application process to become a peer tutor was fairly informal; interested students would talk to the department\u2019s language program coordina- tor, who would assess their language skills and as- sign them to time slots during the quarter.", "Peer tutors earned independent study credits for their participation.", "Participation in this program was mandatory for students in the first through sixth quarters of Spanish language courses, which constituted the first 2 years of Spanish at the university.", "As part of their oral practice grade, each student was least one peer required to sign up for at Michele Back tutoring session per week.", "An excerpt from the de- partment\u2019s Spanish 1\u20136 syllabus further outlines the requirements and restrictions: Oral Practice: You may sign up for oral practice.", "This will be conducted by native speakers.", "This time is not to be used for written homework, assignments or composi- tions.", "Do not ask the tutors for help with these assignments, as it will be considered unauthorized collaboration.", "(my emphases, Spanish 1\u20136 syllabus, April 2011) Peer tutors were provided with written mate- rials for scaffolding oral practice sessions with the students.", "These materials included conver- sation questions, pronunciation exercises, and short readings.", "Generally, peer tutoring sessions for the lower levels (Spanish 1\u20133) adhered strictly to the oral practice materials.", "However, sessions for Spanish 4\u20136 were more open; many students solicited tutor assistance in practicing oral presen- tations for class, even though this was explicitly forbidden in the syllabus.", "Peer tutors would also often lead the conversation in different directions from the practice materials, depending upon the proficiency of the learner.", "With the assistance of several undergraduate student researchers, I collected video and audio data from 43 peer tutoring sessions held during the spring quarter of 2011.", "These sessions were approximately 45 minutes in length, and were composed of as few as one and as many as five learners interacting with one peer tutor.", "In or- der to obtain better audio of the sessions, I sup- plemented the video with a digital voice recorder placed on the tutoring table.", "After recording, an- other group of undergraduate students and my- self transcribed the audio and video data using conversation analysis (CA) transcription conven- tions (see the Appendix for a list of these conven- tions).", "This close discourse analysis included a fo- cus on discursive features of alignment, such as overlaps, intonation, and laughter, in addition to the content of the interactions.", "Video data were also transcribed and analyzed for multimodal ex- pressions of alignment, including gesture, gaze, and the incorporation of artifacts such as cell phones and written oral practice materials.", "The data for this study involve one peer tutor, Lorena, and her peer learners, Rhonda and Al- ice.", "Lorena was a senior and a Spanish major.", "Al- though Lorena did not explicitly take up the iden- tity category of native speaker, in her interactions with learners, including this cohort, she did pro- vide a great deal of information about her back- ground, such as the fact that her mother was from Mexico and her father was from Texas, but also spoke Spanish.", "She also frequently used the first 513 person plural pronoun, \u201cwe,\u201d when referring to Mexicans.", "This background information suggests an orientation to a heritage identity, if not that of native speaker; that is, Lorena\u2019s comments on her family members and her own identity closely ref- erenced the fact that Spanish was at least one of her home languages.", "As I began to examine the peer tutoring videos, I observed that Lorena\u2019s time at talk was quite high relative to other peer tutors.", "Lorena would often tell long, detailed stories about her child- hood, her friends, and her husband that were at best tangentially related to the conversation top- ics in the oral practice materials.", "These stories left little time for peer learners to interact and paral- leled previous findings regarding peer tutor dom- inance.", "Yet despite this dominance, the learners initiated a great deal more ESSs with Lorena com- pared to other peer tutor\u2013learner cohorts.", "This may have been because Lorena, unlike many of the other peer tutors, had a consistent tutoring schedule that allowed her to see the same groups of learners for several sessions over the course of the quarter.", "These repeated meetings played a role in establishing familiarity and a more trusting environment, which would have allowed learners to feel more at ease in initiating ESSs.", "One of Lorena\u2019s cohorts included Alice, an Asian-American student who was taking Spanish 5; and Rhonda, an African-American senior who, like Lorena, was a Spanish major.", "Lorena, Al- ice, and Rhonda met at least five times over the course of the spring quarter; each of these five sessions was recorded.", "While Alice was clearly a peer learner in these sessions, Rhonda\u2019s role was less clear.", "Although Rhonda was one of the un- dergraduate researchers tasked with video record- ing the tutoring sessions, she would often sit at the table when Lorena was tutoring and partic- ipate in the sessions, rather than simply turning on the camera and leaving.", "Rhonda later told me her goal in participating was to practice her Span- ish.", "It was also evident that she was friends with Lorena, as they both would reference conversa- tions and events that had occurred outside of the tutoring sessions.", "The unique nature of this particular peer tu- toring cohort, with each participant possessing varied identity categories of friend, learner, and expert, motivated my interest in closely analyz- ing how they negotiated knowledge among them- selves.", "As I show in the following section, par- ticipants drew upon these identity categories, as well as a variety of resources and histories, in order to resolve the lexical item and negotiate their respective epistemic stances.", "I selected three 514 The Modern Language Journal 100 (2016) types of ESSs for a close discourse analysis: one resolved ESS for the word militares [military]; one unresolved ESS for the word carbo\u0301n [coal]; and one semi-resolved ESS for mellizos [fraternal twins].", "The first two examples come from the first recorded session, filmed at the beginning of the quarter, while the third example comes from the fourth recorded session, filmed at week six of the quarter.", "CO-CONSTRUCTING KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE: THREE

from Lorena as Rhonda continued to search for the word.", "Lorena may not have offered immediate assistance because there was not enough context available to provide a suggested word.", "Another possibility was that, due to Rhonda\u2019s status as a Spanish major and a friend, Lorena constructed Rhonda\u2019s epistemic stance as a co-knower, rather than a learner.", "When Rhonda produced an erro- neous utterance, \u201c*militario,\u201d (7), Lorena\u2019s gaze shifted upward as she began her own search.", "Her repetition of \u201cson\u201d (they are), use of the filler \u201cum\u201d and

co-construction, In this excerpt we see how Rhonda and Lorena co-constructed an acceptable lexical item to provide a rationale for Rhonda\u2019s assessment of her parents as strict.", "Lorena, despite her pre- scribed role as peer tutor, positioned Rhonda as an equal possessor of knowledge in this search by turning her gaze to Rhonda and allowing her to complete her turn over several seconds of silence.", "Later, by providing a possible word that Michele Back she immediately evaluated as unsatisfactory with her comment, \u201cthat sounds negative,\u201d Lorena referenced the symbolic knowledge she had of the term \u201cmilitante,\u201d which is normally used to describe revolutionaries and activists.", "Her ac- ceptance of Rhonda\u2019s suggestion, \u201cmilitares,\u201d was punctuated by an outstretched, pointing gesture, a nod, and an affirmative \u201cmhm?\u201d Despite not having provided the correct word, Lorena played an active part in the co-construction of this search sequence by ceding her turn to allow Rhonda ample search time, incorporating her personal knowledge of \u201cmilitantes,\u201d and the use of her outstretched hand and nod to signal correctness of the term \u201cmilitares.\u201d Throughout this ESS, Alice did not participate, remaining silent until the topic had changed.", "However, Alice did initiate a lexical ESS a few min- utes after this particular sequence.", "Prompted by a second conversation question regarding myths and legends, Alice began to recount the story of Santa Claus and his delivery of coal to misbehav- ing boys and girls as an example of a myth.", "As she continued, she became stuck on the Spanish equivalent of the lexical item \u201ccoal.\u201d Due to the length of this excerpt I divide both it and the anal- ysis

positioning of Rhonda\u2019s epistemic status as equal 515 to her own.", "Although Alice also attempted to collaborate in resolving the ESS, as evidenced by her gaze upward (8) and the statement, \u201cI used this word too,\u201d Lorena did not take up this at- tempt at collaboration with any sort of verbal or embodied acknowledgement.", "Instead, Lorena moved her gaze upward (rather than toward Al- ice) and referenced her own cultural knowledge in an attempt to find the correct word (\u201cokay, when we have a barbecue .", ".", ".\u201d).", "In subsequent turns (not transcribed here

mobile phones.", "Alice and Lorena both visibly initiated searches on their phones (Rhonda was off camera and so it is unknown whether she was also searching).", "After several seconds of searching, Alice offered another suggestion for \u201ccoal\u201d: 23 Alice: trosss- o carbo\u0301n?", "coal?", "24 Lorena: 25 Alice: 26 Lorena: 27 Alice: 28 Lorena: ((Lorena\u2019s gaze to Alice)) car- carBON

and a noise of frustration (\u201cagh\u201d).", "Alice repeated the word in a collocation \u201cbolso de carbo\u0301n\u201d [bag of coal], which Lorena again did not take up, com- menting instead upon the relative speed of Alice\u2019s phone compared to hers.", "In a few more turns the conversation had shifted to other topics and the Spanish lexical item for \u201ccoal\u201d was never resolved.", "In this exchange Lorena\u2019s epistemic stance fluctuated from claiming a lack of knowledge, to drawing upon her own personal history in order to facilitate the ESS, to positioning herself as more knowledgeable than her designated peer learner by rejecting a suggested lexical item.", "Lorena\u2019s 516 initial downgrading of her own knowledge did not disengage her from her status as expert; in- deed, knowing participants often downgrade the epistemics of their responses (Jakonen & Morton, 2015).", "At the same time, Lorena\u2019s incorporation of her cultural knowledge of barbecue-related terms in Spanish served to mediate her epistemic stance as knower.", "This stance was co-constructed by Alice and, possibly, Rhonda; despite the fact that Alice found \u201ccarbo\u0301n\u201d on a neutral search engine (and despite the fact that carbo\u0301n is, in fact, the Spanish equivalent for coal), Lorena\u2019s own doubt as expert led to a lack of resolution of the ESS.", "As Summerson Carr (2010) noted, one ele- ment of expertise is the assumption that oth- ers are less knowledgeable.", "In the discussion on \u201ccoal,\u201d Lorena negotiated her expert role and cultural knowledge to position herself as doubtful about Alice\u2019s own claims to knowledge, even though these claims were assisted by an artifactual, outside source.", "Alice accepted this evaluation and even co-constructed doubt with Lorena with an upraised tone at her suggestion of \u201ccarbo\u0301n?\u201d (23) and by not pressing the issue fur- ther once Lorena\u2019s own phone failed to turn up the desired word.", "Thus, despite an inability to make her own claim to knowledge of the correct Spanish word, Lorena\u2019s gestures, claims to cul- tural knowledge, and rejection of Alice\u2019s sugges- tion, combined with Alice\u2019s alignment to these ac- tions, allowed her to maintain an epistemic status of expert within the cohort.", "We could also say that Rhonda, although off camera, also showed align- ment with her lack of participation and silences, which implied agreement with Lorena\u2019s rejection of \u201ccarbo\u0301n.\u201d In the final excerpt we see Lorena\u2019s contin- ued construction of an expert identity during a vocabulary activity.", "While reading from a list of words relevant to an assignment from Alice\u2019s class, Lorena came upon the word mellizos [fraternal twins].", "What followed was a brief monologue on the term, in which she again attempted to engage Rhonda in a lexical search: EXCERPT 4: \u201cMellizos\u201d 2 1 Lorena: mellizos, mellizos!", "i\u2019ve NEVER heard mellizos ((gaze on text)) for twins.", "i\u2019ve heard, um (.)", "<there\u2019s another one.> (3.5) ((gaze back to paper)) GEMELOS.", "(1.0) cuates, a:and ((gaze to

mellizos.> In this monologue Lorena first expressed sur- prise at the term \u201cmellizos,\u201d then used a negative booster (\u201cnever\u201d) to emphasize her not having heard the term.", "In 2\u20134, she volunteered the lex- ical items that she had heard for \u201ctwins,\u201d which included the Mexican Spanish \u201ccuates\u201d for fra- ternal twins (from the Na\u0301huatl word coatl) and \u201cgemelos,\u201d or identical twins.", "During this mono- logue Lorena turned her gaze to Rhonda twice, perhaps hoping to co-construct and then con- firm the lexical item \u201cgemelos,\u201d similar to how \u201cmil- itares\u201d was achieved.", "However, Rhonda did not take up this invitation\u2014or, at least, her reaction was inaudible\u2014and Lorena produced the item on her own after a few seconds.", "Note again that Alice, as the designated peer learner in this se- quence, and despite the fact that she had been involved in discussing the text in prior turns, was not drawn into the negotiation for the word \u201cgeme- los,\u201d nor did she offer suggestions.", "Lorena\u2019s com- ment, \u201cthose are the ones I\u2019ve heard,\u201d paired with a pointing gesture outwards, again incorporated her historic and symbolic knowledge into her epis- temic stance.", "Similar to Excerpt 3, by claiming what she did know, Lorena was able to downplay her lack of comprehension of lexical items she did not know, thus continuing to negotiate a supe- rior epistemic stance.", "Moreover, by indexing this historic, cultural, and symbolic knowledge as be- longing not only to her, but to a collective com- munity, Lorena effectively \u2018devoiced\u2019 this knowl- edge and rendered it as expertise (Summerson Carr, 2010, p. 25).", "Again, the lack of verbal or em- bodied contribution from either Rhonda or Alice served to align them to the perception of the word \u201cmellizos\u201d as something unheard of or unusual.", "In these excerpts we note a complex array of overlapping resources, from symbolic to arti- factual to embodied, to co-construct knowledge and expertise.", "Though Lorena engaged actively with the other two participants, each was con- structed differently with respect to their epistemic stance.", "At the same time, Rhonda and Alice ap- peared to construct Lorena unreservedly as the expert during these sequences, even when Lorena attempted to draw Rhonda into various ESSs, or when artifactual resources conflicted with Lorena\u2019s assessments.", "These disconnects carry Michele Back some important implications regarding the con- sequences of perceived expertise and the implica- tions for language learning, peer tutoring, and in- terlocutor epistemics.", "I discuss these issues in the next section.", "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Although Summerson Carr (2010) has stated that it is mostly up to the would-be expert to successfully enact expertise, incorporating no- tions of epistemic stance and status allows us to see how knowledge and expertise are instead co- constructed in interaction.", "In the peer tutoring cohort examined here, Lorena did establish an interpretive frame of expert through the incorpo- ration of personal history, devoicing, and various embodied strategies, all of which indexed her right to know.", "Working through her own lexical gaps, Lorena was able to successfully negotiate the overlapping epistemic domains of artifactual resources, such as the text and an Internet search with her own domain of knowledge, affirming those resources that she knew and discarding or ignoring those that she did not know.", "Both Rhonda and Alice demonstrated alignment with Lorena\u2019s epistemic stance by allowing Lorena to hold the floor during most negotiations of ESSs and giving her the final say on lexical searches.", "These findings support previous findings by Thonus (2004) and Bell & Elledge (2008) re- garding peer tutor dominance and perceptions of tutors as higher\u2013status interlocutors.", "However, Lorena also employed several at- tempts at collaboration with Rhonda in order to negotiate certain lexical items.", "Although this led to the successful resolution of one word, \u201cmil- itares,\u201d Rhonda did not take up subsequent col- laborations.", "This could be because Rhonda, as evidenced by her own goals to practice Span- ish, had determined her epistemic status as a sort of \u2018expert novice,\u2019 somewhere on the con- tinuum between Alice\u2019s novice learner identity and Lorena\u2019s expert status.", "Lorena\u2019s attempts to construct Rhonda as a co-expert conflicted with Rhonda\u2019s own perception of her status, leading to a lack of collaboration on ESSs.", "Rhonda\u2019s efforts to resolve \u201cmilitares\u201d may have been due to the fact that she initiated the search for that lexical item.", "When the search was initiated by either Alice or Lorena, as in the cases of \u201ccarbo\u0301n\u201d and \u201cmellizos,\u201d Rhonda perhaps felt that she would overstep her liminal role of expert novice if she contributed.", "This failed collaboration again points to the con- textual nature of negotiating expertise, and sug- gests that perceptions of tutors as higher status 517 interlocutors contain strong ideologies of hierar- chy and, in the case of language tutoring, essen- tialized conceptions of so-called \u2019native speakers.\u2019 In other words, Lorena\u2019s position as peer tutor, combined with references to her personal history as a speaker of Spanish, may have led Rhonda and Alice to limit their engagement during res- olutions of ESSs.", "These findings highlight not only the context- sensitive nature of epistemic stance and status, but also of target language knowledge itself.", "Lorena\u2019s multiple references to her personal history and what she had \u2018heard\u2019 or witnessed in her past point to the symbolic, ideological, and context-specific nature of linguistic and cultural knowledge.", "As Song and Kellogg (2011) stated, \u201c[f]oreign language word meanings appear to be palimpsests of different layers of meaning: iconic, indexical, and, ultimately, symbolic and signifying\u201d (p. 589).", "As demonstrated by Lorena\u2019s monologue on the word \u201cmellizos,\u201d there are potentially multiple versions of certain lexical items, particularly in a global language such as Spanish.", "Although these palimpsests were slightly disturbed by the appearance of a new word or meaning, resulting in the multiple ESSs discussed in this article, Lorena favored her own historical knowledge of these words over artifactual sources in order to construct her epistemic stance as knower.", "Lorena\u2019s favoring of \u201ccuates\u201d over \u201cmel- lizos\u201d is potentially enriching knowledge for her learners, but also speaks to the need for more articulation between classroom and peer tutoring sessions regarding which variety of Spanish is being taught.", "A more comprehensive training program for peer tutors that addresses language varieties taught in the classroom would help to ad- dress these and other trouble sequences in peer tutoring interactions by aligning bodies of knowl- edge between the two environments.", "Moreover, the trouble sequences analyzed here suggest that both peer tutors and classroom teachers would benefit learners by providing them with strategies for negotiating words with multiple equivalents in Spanish, especially given that most learners fre- quently anticipate a one-to-one correspondence between one language and another.", "Additional implications of this case study for peer tutoring in additional languages include rec- ognizing the socialized processes of mediating expertise and epistemic status.", "This study high- lighted how Lorena\u2019s learners readily adopted and maintained the norms of expert\u2013novice in- teraction, even when Lorena solicited help.", "More- over, Lorena\u2019s rejection of Alice\u2019s few contribu- tions also reinforced an expert\u2013novice dichotomy, 518 even when artifactual knowledge (e.g., the Google search results, the vocabulary reading) conflicted with Lorena\u2019s assertions.", "This dichotomy could be disrupted by training tutors in cooperative learn- ing methods, in which they actively adopt a role of facilitator rather than language expert, thus open- ing the door to more opportunities to negotiate meaning on an equal level with their learners.", "An- other possible disruption to this dichotomy would be to have more than one tutor in peer tutor- ing sessions, which could provide an extra source of knowledge for negotiating grammatical, prag- matic, cultural, and lexical items.", "This latter sug- gestion could also work as a training method for peer tutors, pairing one peer tutor with a more experienced one so that the novice tutor may ob- serve, internalize, and imitate cooperative learn- ing methods and ways of articulating expertise.", "Finally, the interactions in this study highlight the ideological nature of expertise, as each par- ticipant displayed her own assumptions regarding Lorena\u2019s right to know, either through a reluc- tance to participate as co-knower (Rhonda) or an acceptance, evidenced by silences, of ESSs where alternative possibilities were discovered (Alice).", "Through these hesitations, Rhonda and Alice co- constructed Lorena, a self-identified speaker of Spanish as a home language, as the default expert.", "These co-constructions parallel previous findings on assumptions regarding native speaker abilities, which may in turn be rooted in ideologies of racial and ethnic essentialism.", "Because these ideologies were not explicitly oriented to in the interactions, we cannot say with certainty that Rhonda and Al- ice\u2019s perceptions of Lorena as an expert were in any way related to perceptions of her ethnic iden- tity.", "Nevertheless, it is an important potential con- nection for future research, which could expand upon recent studies on how race and language abilities are often conflated (e.g., Flores & Rosa, 2015).", "Challenging assumptions that are rooted in\u2014at the very least\u2014essentialist conceptions of interlocutor expertise could lead to more egali- tarian and productive negotiations of meaning, as well as peer tutors who are more savvy and skilled at both communicating their own expertise and recognizing the expertise of others.", "LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH Throughout this study I have emphasized the interactional nature of knowledge contextual, and expertise as a response to the essentialized perceptions of knowledge in previous studies on peer tutoring.", "Given that this is a case study, it is not my intention to generalize these findings to The Modern Language Journal 100 (2016) other peer tutoring settings, even to those within my own, larger data set.", "However, it is my hope that this study will motivate others to further ex- plore how knowledge is enacted and negotiated among peer tutoring cohorts, in this way contin- uing to outline the complex overlays of history, ideology, and socialization practices that charac- terize the knowledge of any given language.", "Peer tutoring in additional language learning offers a unique environment for exposure to these overlays; however, the perception of peer tutors as a homogeneous group of \u2018experts\u2019 limits our understanding of epistemic complexity, just as perceptions of \u2018one\u2019 target language and culture restrict our ability to negotiate the global reality of linguistic and cultural heterogeneity.", "With this study I hope to begin a dialogue on how we can take advantage of the rich linguistic and cultural complexity of peer tutors, while at the same time discussing how training might give them the necessary tools to negotiate this complexity in meaningful and egalitarian ways.", "It is quite clear from this study and others that the current trend of leaving peer tutoring to the so-called \u2018experts\u2019 reduces its benefit for learners and tutors alike.", "Last, it is hoped that further research will also delve deeper into the whys of homogenous per- ceptions of linguistic expertise, including an anal- ysis of how identity categories such as race and ethnicity relate to this perception, as well as the myths that continue to surround the native and nonnative speaker.", "Similar to the benefits of dif- ferentiating instruction for language learners, by recognizing the differences in knowledge that in- terlocutors bring to interactions, we can learn to accommodate these differences, while still appre- ciating the unique awareness that peer tutors and other interlocutors contribute to additional lan- guage learning.", "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS An earlier version of this article was presented at the 4th Meeting of the

through sharing the si- milar learning experiences and empowers the baccalaureate students to participate in the learning process actively.", "Peer tutoring fosters both formal and informal communication, providing students a supportive safety net.", "Through serving as models, peer tutors also \u201cmentor\u201d un- dergraduates' teaching how to learn and helped them translate simu- lation with clinical reality, implementing theory into practice.", "All the actions mentioned help undergraduates to adapt to the simulation as soon as possible, decrease their anxiety and relieve their cognitive burnout.", "Though students acknowledge the peer tutoring's benefits, there are some negative comments about it.", "Furthermore, all the par- ticipants in this study had only one-semester experience of peer tu- toring.", "The time was short, but the influences of peer tutoring were exposed adequately.", "Future research should be conducted to expand the effects of peer tutoring in the simulation laboratory and the bacca- laureate students' perspectives.", "Author Contributions Design: TL, MP.", "Research supervision: MP.", "Data collection: TL.", "Data analysis: TL,

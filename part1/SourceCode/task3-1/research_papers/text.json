Classwide peer tutoring (CWPT) is one such instructional practice. In addition to describing CWPT, its research \nbase, and supporting theoretical perspectives, this article describes a project in which a classroom teacher in a remedial \neducation program worked collaboratively with an educational researcher to examine the impact of CWPT on her pupils\u2019 \nmath computational fluency as monitored on district-adopted, curriculum-based assessments. Results indicated that all pupils, \nincluding those with disabilities, made substantial learning gains and improved their academic-related behavior in class. The \nteacher reported that CWPT was relatively easy to implement and that her students loved playing the tutoring game in math.\n\nKeywords\nclasswide peer tutoring, math fluency, students with special needs, curriculum-based assessment\n\nA national crisis of poor learning outcomes is evident in \nreading, math, and other core subject areas. These failures \nare particularly noticeable among students with special needs; \npupils from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds; \nand those from environments of poverty, abuse, or neglect \n(Education Trust, 2005). It is also clear that poor learning \noutcomes are often the product of diverse learner character-\nistics present when children enter school and relatively weak \ninstructional interventions that struggling students encoun-\nter in school (Greenwood, Maheady, & Delquadri, 2002). \nThese early learning challenges often transform into more \n\nsubstantive problems such as grade retention, dropping out \nof school, increased discipline issues, and placement in spe-\ncial and remedial education programs\u2014outcomes that further \nlimit  student  access  to  higher  education,  contribute  to \nincreased unemployment, and diminish individuals\u2019 abilities \nto contribute to society (Heal, Khoju, & Rusch, 1997). At \nthe  heart  of  this  immense  instructional  challenge  are \n\nCorresponding Author:\nLarry Maheady, SUNY Fredonia, Department of Curriculum and \nInstruction, Fredonia, NY 14063 (e-mail: maheady@fredonia.edu).\n\n\f72 \n\n \n\nIntervention in School and Clinic 46(2)\n\nhardworking classroom teachers who try to accommodate a \nrapidly  diversifying  student  population,  using  an  ever-\nexpanding and often inconsiderate curriculum, and doing so \noften under conditions of dwindling instructional support \n(McLeskey, Rosenberg, & Westling, 2010). These classroom \nteachers do not need the will or desire to help all of their \nstudents to succeed; they already possess that. What they \nneed are the tools for doing so. They need more powerful \nacademic and behavioral interventions that can improve the \nperformance of all students (i.e., high-, average-, and low-\nachieving), that can be applied on a proactive and classwide \nbasis, and that can be sustained under existing levels of \ninstructional support and assistance. Classwide peer tutoring \n(CWPT) is one of those potentially powerful instructional \ntools.\n\nPractice Description\n\nClasswide peer tutoring refers to a class of instructional \nstrategies in which students are taught by peers who are \ntrained and supervised by the classroom teacher (Green-\nwood et al., 2002). The oldest and most widely researched \nclasswide tutoring model was developed at Juniper Gar-\ndens Children\u2019s Project in Kansas City, Kansas, almost 30 \nyears ago. The program is currently available in manual \nform  under  the  commercial  title  of  Together  We  Can \n(Greenwood, Delquadri, & Carta, 1997). The Juniper Gar-\ndens\u2019 CWPT program emerged from collaborations among \neducational researchers and a classroom teacher who was \ntrying to successfully integrate children with learning dis-\nabilities (LD) into her general education setting (Del-\nquadri, Greenwood, Stretton, & Hall, 1983). Importantly, \nthe following criteria were established during initial CWPT \ndevelopment: The program would (a) not create extra work \nfor the teacher, (b) benefit all children in the class, (c) use \nmaterials and resources found in existing instructional \nprograms, (d) supplement rather than supplant current \ninstruction, and (e) be conducted within existing instruc-\ntional time periods (Delquadri et al., 1983). It is these \nparticular attributes that may make CWPT an appealing \ninstructional option for classroom teachers.\n\nThe resulting CWPT program allowed teachers to simul-\ntaneously engage all of their students in reading, math, and \nspelling activities for about 30 minutes per day in each subject \narea. The program was applicable across first- through sixth-\ngrade classrooms and was used from 3 to 5 days per week. \nOver the past 25 years, other similar classwide tutoring \nmodels have emerged:\n\n1.  peer-assisted learning strategies (PALS; Fuchs, \n\nFuchs, Mathes, & Simmons, 1996),\n\n2.  The Ohio State START Tutoring Program (Heron, \n\nHeward, Cooke, & Hill, 1983),\n\n3.  classwide student tutoring teams (CSTT; Harper & \n\n4.  reciprocal peer tutoring (RPT; Fantuzzo & Ginsburg-\n\nMaheady, 1999), and\n\nBlock, 1998).\n\nThese programs expand the utility and flexibility of peer \ntutoring methods. The Juniper Gardens\u2019 model, however, is \nthe focus of this article.\n\nThe Juniper Gardens\u2019 CWPT program has four primary \ncomponents: (a) weekly competing teams; (b) highly struc-\ntured, reciprocal tutoring procedures; (c) daily point earning, \npublic posting, and contingent rewards; and (d) direct practice \nin functional instructional activities. CWPT was developed \nas an alternative practice activity that can be used in place \nof independent work time. It should not be done with new \nmaterial but rather used with content that was taught previ-\nously through direct instruction. CWPT has been used effec-\ntively to improve both basic academic skills (e.g., reading, \nwriting, math, spelling fluency) and students\u2019 acquisition and \nretention  of  important  content  knowledge. When  using \nCWPT, teachers\u2019 roles change from primary deliverers of \ninstruction  to  facilitators  and  monitors  of  peer-teaching \nactivities.\n\nA Sample CWPT Spelling Session\n\nEach week, teachers form two competing teams by having \npupils select colored pieces of paper (e.g., red or blue) from \na covered box. The number of students in class determines \nhow many pieces of paper are placed in the box (e.g., 24 stu-\ndents = 12 red and 12 blue pieces). The teacher then puts \nstudents with the same colored paper into tutoring pairs \n(i.e., 6 red and 6 blue pairs). CWPT does not provide explicit \ndirections regarding tutor assignment other than initially \nplacing students who are most likely to work well together \ninto pairs and monitoring ongoing performance to ensure \nthat everyone is making adequate progress each week. If all \nstudents are performing well, then team membership and \npartners stay the same for the rest of the week. Each subse-\nquent week, students reach into the box and are assigned \nto different teams and partners. Throughout the year, pupils \ntypically move from team to team and have an opportunity \nto work with every peer.\n\nWithin each pair, tutoring roles are reciprocal. Students \nserve as both tutors and tutees during each session and follow \na highly structured tutoring procedure. After pupils retrieve \ntheir tutoring materials (i.e., weekly spelling list, blank paper, \nand a deck of numbered cards), the teacher sets a timer for \napproximately 10 minutes. For the first 10 minutes, one pupil \nin each pair serves as tutor. Tutors present each item on previ-\nously constructed curriculum materials (e.g., weekly spelling \nlists) and provide immediate positive and constructive feed-\nback (i.e., verbal and points) contingent on tutee responses. \n\n\fMaheady and Gard \n\n73\n\nTable 1.

Tutors then award 2 points for each word \nspelled correctly. If tutees misspell target words, however, \ntutors say \u201cincorrect\u201d and then provide the correct response \n(i.e., tutors orally spell the word). Tutees then correct their \nerrors by writing the word correctly three times. If errors \nwere corrected appropriately, tutors award 1 point. If tutees \nfail to correct their errors by either refusing or making mis-\ntakes during the correction phase, then no points are given \nfor that item. Students complete as many items as possible \nbefore the time period elapses. They are told that the more \nitems they complete correctly, the more points they will earn \nfor themselves and their respective teams. When the timer \ngoes off, students reverse roles and follow the same tutoring \nprocedures for an equivalent amount of time.\n\nWhile pupils are engaged in appropriate tutoring behav-\niors, teachers move about the classroom and award bonus \npoints to maintain high levels of implementation accuracy. \nTeachers award bonus points to tutors, for example, for  \n(a) maintaining a brisk pace; (b) providing clear, immediate, \nand concise feedback; (c) using the error correction proce-\ndures appropriately; and (d) providing unsolicited support-\nive  comments.  Similarly,  tutees  earn  bonus  points  by \nworking quickly and accurately, correcting their errors \nimmediately and without comment, and producing high-\nquality responses. Teachers typically award up to 10 bonus \npoints per student by writing on the top of pupils\u2019 practice \nsheets in a different colored pen each day (to prevent cheat-\ning) and commenting on what was done appropriately. \nTeachers also try to balance the number of bonus points \nassigned to each team.\n\nAfter pupils have served in both roles, they add the number \nof points earned, including bonus points, and write their \n\nrespective totals on their papers. Individual student points, \nas well as daily and cumulative team totals, are then displayed \npublicly on a laminated scoreboard in the front of the class-\nroom. CWPT procedures typically remain in effect from 3 \nto 4 days per week. On Fridays, pupils are evaluated indi-\nvidually using existing assessment procedures (e.g., weekly \nspelling tests). Pupils are told that they can earn 5 points for \nthemselves and their respective teams for each word they \nspell correctly on the test.\n\nPoint earnings from weekly spelling tests are then added \nto cumulative point totals for each team to determine a weekly \nwinning team. Team-of-the-week certificates are presented \nand signed by each member of the winning team. Certificates \nare then posted on the outside wall of each classroom or \nwithin the room itself. Each week, new competing teams are \nformed, thereby increasing the probability that each student \nwill participate on a winning team, while simultaneously \nminimizing the possibility that cliques will develop. See \nTable 1 for a summary of the essential components for imple-\nmenting CWPT.\n\nPractitioner Narrative, by Jaime Gard\n\nI was initially unfamiliar with the Juniper Gardens\u2019 CWPT \nprogram. I heard about it in a graduate education class I took \nwhile also teaching a remedial education class in mathematics \nin a local school district. All students in this class were identi-\nfied as being at risk for failure based upon poor performance \non high-stakes, state-level testing and districtwide math flu-\nency assessments. They were not particularly motivated by \nmath and often engaged in off-task and disruptive classroom \nbehaviors. At the start of the year, students often said that \nthey \u201chated math\u201d or were \u201ctoo stupid to do math.\u201d CWPT \n\n\f74 \n\n \n\nIntervention in School and Clinic 46(2)\n\nsounded like a promising alternative to motivate students \nand improve their math computational skills.\n\nI implemented CWPT with 8 fifth-grade remedial students \nin a small, culturally and linguistically diverse, urban elemen-\ntary school during the 2008\u20132009 school year. The group \nconsisted of five girls and three boys who were 10 years old \nat the time. Five students were Hispanic, two were Caucasian, \nand one was African American. Of the five Hispanic students, \ntwo were classified as English language learners (ELLs). \nTwo of the students had IEPs [Individualized Education Pro-\ngrams] for documented learning disabilities. One student \nreceived accommodations under a [Section] 504 plan due to \na  diagnosis  of  attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder \n(ADHD). Five of the eight students also qualified for free or \nreduced meals. In 2007\u20132008, six students received scores \nof 2 on the fourth-grade New York State math exam, and two \nothers earned scores of 1 (minimum passing grade was 3).\n\nThe remedial math classes were designed to supplement \nregular math instruction and improve student performance \non high stakes and districtwide assessments. The eight stu-\ndents received math instruction from me in small groups \nduring 60-minute instructional blocks each day. These ser-\nvices were provided by me \u201cpushing into\u201d the general educa-\ntion classroom and working with my small group of students. \nIn addition to the 60-minute instructional block, students \nreceived 30 minutes of services in a \u201cpull out\u201d setting 4 days \na week. CWPT was done during the 30-minute pull-out ses-\nsions. The district-adopted core math curriculum, Investiga-\ntions in Number, Data, and Space (TERC, 2008), was used \nfor all instruction.\n\nAlthough the district-adopted curriculum appeared to help \nin some math areas, it was not particularly useful in improv-\ning multiplication and division fluency. The goal, therefore, \nwas to use CWPT to improve my students\u2019 computational \nfluency in these areas. This goal was important for a few \nreasons. First, basic multiplication and division fluency is \ncritical to improved performance in upper level math courses \nwhere students are expected to apply their computational \nskills to solve problems. Second, the school district uses \nmathematics fluency measures to monitor pupil progress and \ndetermine who needs supplemental instruction. Students with \nthe lowest benchmark fluency scores (measured in digits \ncorrect per minute) are categorized as needing intensive \nintervention, and students whose scores are not as low but \nwho do not meet grade-level benchmarks are identified as \nbeing in need of strategic intervention. All of my eight reme-\ndial students demonstrated a need for intensive intervention \nat the start of the school year. Additionally, development of \nmath fluency was included among two students\u2019 IEP goals \nfor the year.\n\nFrom October through December, students used CWPT \nin multiplication, while September served as an initial base-\nline period. During February into June, students used CWPT \nin division, with January serving as a second baseline period. \n\nStudents were trained initially to use CWPT during three \n30-minute sessions. I described the procedures, selected two \nstudents to demonstrate them, and then had all students role-\nplay the procedures while I moved around the classroom and \nprovided positive and corrective feedback. Students quickly \nlearned to move to their partners, take out the necessary \nmaterials, and practice their roles as both tutors and tutees. \nI used a 20-item checklist of all CWPT procedures to make \nsure that they were using it correctly. When pupils were using \nCWPT with at least 90% accuracy, we began using it formally \nwith multiplication facts.\n\nClasswide peer tutoring was used in a similar way as the \nspelling example. Each week, new teams were formed by \nhaving pupils select colored pieces of paper from a covered \nbox. During each session, students served as both tutors and \ntutees for 10 minutes each. Given that students were randomly \nassigned to teams each week and were generally working \nbelow grade expectations in their math fluency, individual \nperformance levels were not a major consideration when \nforming teams. Instead of using weekly spelling lists, how-\never, pupils used flashcards displaying multiplication and \ndivision problems up to 12 \u00d7 12 and 144/12, with correct \nsolutions on the back. Tutees were required to read each \nproblem and provide the solution orally as well as write the \nproblem and solve it on paper. Tutors provided positive and \ncorrective feedback and points as described earlier (i.e., 2 \npoints for correct solutions and 1 point if errors were corrected \nappropriately). I also awarded bonus points for prosocial \nbehavior and correct use of tutoring procedures. At the end of \neach CWPT session, teams totaled their points and recorded \nthem on a class graph. On Thursday afternoon, the team with \nthe most points earned a team-of-the-week certificate. Students \nthen completed their weekly math fluency assessments each \nFriday. These data were graphed for the entire group and indi-\nvidual pupils to monitor student progress.\n\nAmazingly, CWPT implementation proceeded in a very \norderly manner. That is, half of the students, designated \n\u201cstayers,\u201d  remained  at  their  desks  while  their  partners \n(\u201cmovers\u201d) moved next to them. Pupils complied well with \nour posted tutoring rules (i.e., move quickly and quietly, talk \nonly during tutoring sessions, talk only to your tutoring part-\nners) and appeared very excited to play the tutoring game. \nRule following [compliance], therefore, was very high. It \nwas important, however, to move through the classroom \nwhile tutoring was going on. This allowed me to award bonus \npoints for good tutoring behavior while also minimizing the \nlikelihood of cheating or point inflation. To further minimize \nthe possibility of cheating, I randomly selected one pupil\u2019s \npaper from each team and rescored it to see if all errors were \ncorrected, an appropriate number of points were assigned, \nand the point total on top of the paper matched the number \nawarded. If these conditions were met, then I gave 50 bonus \npoints to that team. If scoring differences emerged, then \nI simply corrected the paper, inserted the appropriate total \n\n\fMaheady and Gard \n\n75\n\non top, and did not award bonus points for that particular \nteam. It is important to note that there were no instances of \novert cheating or flagrant point inflation during the study.\n\nThe use of CWPT produced immediate and noticeable \nimprovements in all students\u2019 multiplication fluency. On \naverage, the class increased their digits correct per minute \nby 11 digits from October to December on the district-adopted \nCBM assessment. This resulted in all students being reclas-\nsified as in need of strategic rather than intensive intervention. \nCloser inspection revealed that both the highest- and lowest-\nperforming students showed comparable improvements \n(i.e., 11 digits for highest achiever and 10 digits for lowest \nperformer). Students also improved their classroom behavior \nand understanding of math tasks. They participated much \nmore often in class discussions and showed more confidence \nwhen solving challenging multiplication problems. Moreover, \nthe complaining about math and off-task behaviors dropped \nconsiderably. Similar outcomes were noted when CWPT was \nused with division facts. Following a 20-minute retraining \nsession, students used CWPT with division problems. Once \nagain, all eight students displayed noticeable improvements \nby moving from intensive to strategic intervention classifica-\ntion. In-class performance also continued to be much better \nthan when CWPT was not in effect.\n\nA few other outcomes were noteworthy. First, when stu-\ndents initially used CWPT, they responded rather slowly and \nonly accumulated about 20 to 40 points per session. As the \nyear progressed, however, they worked more quickly and \ntypically earned in excess of 80 points per session. This meant \nthat they were doing more work in the same amount of time, \nwhich is very important if they are to reduce the gap between \nthemselves and normally achieving peers. Second, four of \neight students received passing scores on the New York State \nhigh-stakes math assessment, whereas another improved her \nscore from a 1 to 2. While all students did not meet the desired \nbenchmark score of 3, more than half improved their perfor-\nmance on the state test. In the past, very few if any students \nshowed similar improvements. Third, when CWPT was dis-\ncontinued for approximately 3 weeks in January, pupil flu-\nency rates declined and complaining increased again. Once \nCWPT was resumed, all students\u2019 fluency rates rose once \nagain. Perhaps most importantly, students showed remarkable \nchanges in their attitudes toward math when using CWPT. \nThey made remarks such as, \u201cI can do math now,\u201d and  \n\u201cI used to be bad at math but now I\u2019m good.\u201d They tried \nmore challenging math applications and even increased their \nuse of prosocial comments toward each other. They became \nmore supportive of one another and worked extra hard to \nhelp classmates who were struggling. Students were very \nproud of their improvements and even made their own line \ngraphs to show their progress.\n\nOverall, I found CWPT to be rather easy and inexpensive \nto use. I was able to use existing curriculum materials in the \n\nform of flashcards, and pupils were assessed using district-\nadopted evaluation procedures (digits correct per minute). \nSessions were scheduled to replace independent seatwork, \nmy pupils enjoyed playing the \u201ctutoring game,\u201d and it fostered \nmore positive peer interactions. I made only a few minor \nchanges in Juniper Gardens\u2019 procedures. First, students were \nallowed to create their own line graphs to monitor their flu-\nency progress. This is not normally a part of the CWPT pro-\ngram,  but  it  seemed  to  really  motivate  the  students  and \nprovided an opportunity to \u201cshow off\u201d for parents and peers. \nSecond, there was no weekly individual test for students to \nearn additional points. Rather, daily CWPT points were added \ninto cumulative totals, and winning teams were designated \neach Thursday based solely on practice session points. Ini-\ntially, I had tried to award 5 additional points for each digit \ncorrect on the Friday assessments, but this became quite \ntime-consuming. Finally, initial training in the proper use of \nCWPT was very important, as were teacher monitoring and \nbonus points, to ensure students used the procedures cor-\nrectly. A brief retraining session was also needed after the \nholiday break. However, once students learned the proce-\ndures, they carried them out without teacher assistance even \nwhen substitutes were teaching.\n\nTheory\n\nJuniper Gardens\u2019 CWPT has its theoretical foundations in \nthe effective instruction (Brophy & Good, 1986; Rosenshine, \n1979), eco-behavior analysis (e.g., Greenwood, Delquadri, \nStanley, Terry, & Hall, 1985), and, to a lesser extent, social \nlearning (e.g., Slavin, 1995) literatures. Effective instruction \ntheorists emphasize the importance of time and active student \nresponding as important predictors of student learning and \nperformance. They argue that classroom teachers really do \nmake a significant difference in student learning (an unpopu-\nlar belief at that time) and that some teachers and instructional \npractices are more effective than others in improving pupil \nachievement. These theorists argue further that (a) as one \nincreased active learning time and maintained high levels of \npupil success (e.g., >80%), pupil achievement would increase \nirrespective of cultural, linguistic, and/or socioeconomic \nvariables; and (b) the systematic arrangement of instructional \nvariables could remediate and potentially prevent learning \nfailure (Brophy & Good, 1986; Rosenshine, 1979). CWPT \nessentially harnesses these instructional variables into a \ngame format that actively engages all pupils simultaneously, \nprovides immediate positive and corrective feedback, and \noffers  contingent  rewards  for  improved  academic \nperformance.\n\nEco-behavioral analysis emerged as a subarea in the field \nof applied behavior analysis that emphasizes the importance \nof contextual factors\u2014such as classroom physical arrange-\nments, instructional materials, and teacher behavior\u2014and \n\n\f76 \n\n \n\nIntervention in School and Clinic 46(2)\n\ntheir  interactions  with  student  behavior  (Greenwood, \nCarta, & Atwater, 1990). Until this time, behavior analysts \nhad focused most attention on the important relationships \nbetween student behavior and environmental consequences \n(e.g., reinforcement, punishment, extinction). Yet, emerging \nobservational research suggested that many children failed \ndue to insufficient \u201copportunities to respond\u201d provided in \nthe curriculum and by teacher lessons (Greenwood et al., \n1985). These researchers demonstrated, for example, that \nsome students who were presumably failing because of learn-\ning disabilities were actually spending very little time (e.g., \nless than 6 minutes per day) actively responding (i.e., reading, \nwriting, and discussing) in class. Although some of their \nlearning difficulties may have stemmed from processing \ndifficulties, providing such few response opportunities made \nit highly unlikely that pupils would improve academically.\n\nThe key to CWPT\u2019s effectiveness is that it increases all \nstudents\u2019 opportunities to respond actively in class and pro-\nvides motivation in the form of between-team competition, \npoint earning, and contingent rewards. Moreover, the use of \na reciprocal tutoring format permits all students to practice \nacademic tasks (e.g., reading orally, spelling, doing math \ncomputations) under conditions of constant monitoring, \nimmediate error correction, and positive consequences for \ncorrect responding (Veerkamp, Kamps, & Cooper, 2007).\n\nWith roots also in the social learning literature (Slavin, \n1995), CWPT models are not value-free; rather, they empha-\nsize equality of opportunity, mutual assistance, shared goals, \ninterdependency, and group cohesion (Harper & Maheady, \n2007). Slavin (1995) noted further that at least four major \ntheoretical perspectives (i.e., motivational, social cohesion, \ncognitive, and developmental) speak to the beneficial effects \nof peer-teaching strategies on student learning. Motivational \ntheorists argue, for example, that group goals and reward \nstructures provide incentives for pupils to help one another \nand thereby maximize their own success. Social cohesion \ntheorists, conversely, suggest that students help each other \nmore readily in peer teaching situations because they care \nmore about one another (i.e., more group cohesion) and want \nother  team  members  to  succeed.  In  contrast,  cognitive \nresearchers suggest that the verbal and nonverbal interactions \namong pupils themselves enhance students\u2019 mental process-\ning skills and increase their academic achievement. By teach-\ning others, students gain a deeper understanding of the content \nitself. Finally, developmental theorists argue that collabora-\ntive activities among children promote growth because indi-\nviduals  work  within  one  another\u2019s  proximal  zones  of \ndevelopment  and  model  collaborative  group  behaviors \nslightly above their own.\n\nResearch Evidence\n\nBuzhardt, Greenwood, Abbott, and Tapia (2007) noted that \nmore  than  35  empirical  studies  have  been  conducted  to \n\nsupport CWPT\u2019s effectiveness. These studies have included \nboth single-case and between-group experimental designs; \nhave been conducted by independent researchers in multiple \nsites around the country; and have produced positive aca-\ndemic and behavioral effects across a variety of content \nareas (e.g., reading, math, spelling, social studies, science, \nhealth, physical education, modern languages), developmen-\ntal levels (e.g., elementary, middle, high school), and edu-\ncational settings (e.g., general, remedial, special education \nclassrooms).  Research  findings  indicated  that  CWPT  \n(a) significantly improved student academic performance on \nboth  curriculum-specific  and  standardized  measures  of \nachievement, (b) reduced disruptive behavior (Mitchem, \nYoung, West, & Benyo, 2001), and (c) enhanced interpersonal \ninteractions among students from different cultural and lin-\nguistic backgrounds (e.g., Madrid, Canas, & Ortega-Medina, \n2007) as well as between children with disabilities and their \nnormally developing peers (e.g., Sideridis et al., 1997). The \nmost compelling empirical support for CWPT, however, came \nfrom a 12-year experimental longitudinal study (Green-\nwood, Delquadri, & Hall, 1989). Here, researchers compared \ngroups of at-risk and nonrisk students who did and did not \nreceive CWPT. They found that CWPT (a) increased students\u2019 \nactive  engagement  during  instruction  in  Grades  1  to  3;  \n(b) improved student achievement at Grades 2, 3, 4, and 6; \n(c) reduced the number of CWPT students in need of special \neducation services by Grade 7; and (d) decreased the number \nof students who dropped out of school by the end of Grade \n11 (Greenwood et al., 2002).\n\nMore recently, CWPT research has been extended to include \nmore  secondary-age  learners  (Bowman-Perrott,  2009; \nVeerkamp et al., 2007) and to examine different forms of \nCWPT (i.e., cooperative versus competitive teams; Madrid \net al., 2007). To date, there have been relatively few CWPT \napplications in secondary classes. Veerkamp et al. (2007) dem-\nonstrated that utilizing CWPT with an adapted lottery rein-\nforcement system improved the academic performance of three \nurban general education classes in which novels were used as \nthe curriculum. Positive effects for CWPT at the secondary \nlevel were also seen in a study by Bowman-Perrott (2009). \nHere, the classroom teacher used CWPT in two alternative \nhigh school biology classes to teach vocabulary and factual \nscience content to students with emotional and behavior dis-\norders. In addition to improved academic performance and \nnoticeable decreases in students\u2019 off-task and disruptive behav-\niors, Bowman-Perrott noted that CWPT produced (a) more \npraise among pupils who typically had difficulty with positive \nsocial interactions, (b) increased levels of cooperation and \nbetter acceptance of adult feedback, and (c) generalized use \nof positive social behavior beyond the tutoring sessions.\n\nMadrid et al. (2007) examined the impact of an adapted \nversion of CWPT on the spelling performance of 16 bilingual \nfourth-grade students. Drawing upon cultural theory that \nsuggested that Hispanic children are more cooperative than \n\n\fMaheady and Gard \n\n77\n\ntheir Caucasian peers, Madrid created a \u201ccooperative\u201d form \nof CWPT and compared pupil performance to standard (i.e., \nbetween-team competition) CWPT and teacher-led instruc-\ntion. In the cooperative CWPT condition, teams with more \ntutoring points each day were asked to share their points with \nother team members. Whereas both versions of CWPT pro-\nduced better academic outcomes than teacher-led instruction, \nimprovements were consistently higher under the cooperative \nCWPT format.\n\nThis  brief  review  of  the  CWPT  research  literature  is \nintended to be illustrative rather than comprehensive; yet, it \nis possible to derive some general strengths and limitations. \nRegarding strengths, one must be impressed with both the \nnumber and consistency of CWPT findings. As noted, more \nthan 35 empirical studies have been conducted on CWPT. \nThe  majority  of  these  studies  used  single-case  research \ndesigns that were implemented rigorously. Most studies, for \nexample, targeted important academic and behavioral out-\ncomes; measured the reliability with which outcome data \nwere collected; documented that CWPT was used with a high \ndegree of accuracy; and assessed the social acceptability of \nthe intervention for teachers, pupils, and administrators. It \nis also noteworthy that similar outcomes were obtained across \nmultiple research sites, in diverse content areas, and across \na broad range of students and settings. The fact that so many \ndifferent researchers working in so many different areas with \nso many different students got similar results speaks to the \ninstructional power of CWPT.\n\nObviously, there are also some noteworthy limitations in \nthe existing database. First, more randomized control trials \n(i.e., between-group experiments) are needed to strengthen \nCWPT\u2019s external validity, or the extent to which findings can \nbe generalized to other students, teachers, and settings. It would \nbe interesting to conduct such investigations within the context \nof \u201cscaling up\u201d studies similar to that conducted by Buzhardt \net al. (2007). Whereas there have been numerous smaller scale \ndemonstrations of CWPT\u2019s effectiveness, it is important to \nexamine the extent to which the intervention can be imple-\nmented on a buildingwide and districtwide basis. A third limi-\ntation is that CWPT has been used almost exclusively to \ndevelop basic academic skills and increase the acquisition and \nretention of factual knowledge. Applications with higher order \nacademic outcomes would extend CWPT\u2019s utility. Finally, \nmore long-term investigations that examine broader instruc-\ntional outcomes (e.g., performance on high-stakes assessments, \nprogress through school) would be welcomed.\n\nIn conclusion, CWPT is supported by a number of theo-\nretical perspectives (e.g., effective instruction, eco-behavior \nanalysis, social learning) and a rich research base indicating \nits effectiveness for a variety of students in different educa-\ntional environments. In addition to describing how CWPT is \nused generally, also included are authentic teacher experiences \nbased on real-world implementation of CWPT. It proved to \n\nbe a powerful instructional strategy for improving the math \nfluency of students who had struggled for years in this area. \nThe program was easy to implement, required few additional \nmaterials or time, and was very enjoyable for students.\n\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interest\n\nThe author(s) declared no conflicts of interest with respect to the \nauthorship and/or publication of this article. \n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or \nauthorship of this article. \n\nFunding\n\nReferences\n\nBowman-Perrott, L.

The aim was to achieve\nadequate implementation quality with modest pre-intervention training for teach-\ners, who received brief didactic training and no process feedback (but they were\nto train pupils using modelling, practice and feedback). Implementation integrity\nwas observed in Year 1 in 29 randomly selected schools;\nin Year 2 in 30\nrandomly selected schools. In both years some observed variables of class-wide\ncontext and individual technique were high; however, some were lower. There\nwere deficits in: teachers introducing the problem, suggesting ways to concretise\nthe problem and holding plenary sessions. Crucially, there was very little sum-\nmarising or generalising. Thus, implementation was partial in both years, but\nbetter in Year 2. The implications for future intensity of training are explored.\n\nKeywords: mathematics; peer tutoring; implementation integrity; implementation\nfidelity; observation\n\nThe aim of this study was to see what quality of implementation integrity was\nachievable with modest pre-intervention training for teachers. The context was a\ntwo-year randomised controlled trial of peer tutoring of mathematics involving 80\nschools in one school district, using the Duolog Math technique. Schools were\nassigned mathematics or reading + mathematics tutoring, light or intensive interven-\ntion and same-age or cross-age tutoring. Undertaking process measurement of all 80\nschools would be an enormous task, so in this study, implementation quality was\nassessed by direct observation by researchers in 29 and 30 randomly selected\nschools in each year (without control group measurement). The quality of imple-\nmentation integrity of math tutoring (in relation to the relatively brief and simple\ninitial training for teachers) was likely to be crucial in the successfulness of the\nintervention. In this study, the implementation quality of the teacher\u2019s initial attempt\nto train the children was not measured. What was measured was the quality of\nclass-wide teacher\u2013pupil supportive interaction and the quality of tutor\u2013tutee tech-\nnique at mid-point. Research questions consequently concerned the level of\nimplementation integrity, difference between years and whether general contextual\nclassroom factors were associated with the quality of individual tutoring technique.\nThis study focuses on process.\n\n*Corresponding author.

Topping et al.\n\nBackground\nThis section discusses the nature of peer tutoring. It then discusses implementa-\ntion integrity and connects this with quality of pre-intervention training. Both are\nkey to the aim of this study. It then discusses the tutoring technique used here,\nand research on its effectiveness, in relation to the structure of the process obser-\nvations.\n\nPeer tutoring\nThe current intervention was peer tutoring \u2013 characterised by specific role-taking\n(tutor or tutee), and usually one-on-one tuition and high focus on curriculum con-\ntent. There are specific procedures for interaction, in which participants are likely to\nhave training that is generic or specific or both. The effects of social interactivity,\ndiscourse, reflection and motivation feature in theoretical models of tutoring (e.g.\nTopping & Ehly, 1998). The literature is large and studies tend to show benefits\nboth for the tutors \u2013 perhaps due to their need to reflect and communicate concepts\nand procedures \u2013 and for the tutees (Britz, Dixon, & McLaughlin, 1989; Cohen,\nKulik, & Kulik, 1982; Robinson, Schofield, & Steers-Wentzell, 2005; Rohrbeck,\nGinsburg-Block, Fantuzzo, & Miller, 2003). In a review, Ginsburg-Block, Rohr-\nbeck, and Fantuzzo (2006) found that structured pupil roles within which pupils\nhad a degree of personal autonomy, individualised evaluation, interdependent group\nrewards and same-gender grouping accounted for most of the impact. The tutoring\ntechnique used in the current study featured highly structured pupil roles and inter-\naction and a high degree of pupil autonomy and individual evaluation, but did not\nfeature interdependent group rewards or same-gender matching (the first was\nhypothesised as a complication of uncertain worth in the UK context, and the sec-\nond potentially restrictive in classes with different numbers of males and females).\n\nTutoring procedures are most effective when thoroughly scaffolded (Cohen\net al., 1982; Sharpley & Sharpley, 1981; Topping & Ehly, 1998), since untrained\ntutoring behaviours tend to be primitive (e.g. Person & Graesser, 1999), character-\nised by infrequent correction of errors and inappropriate giving of positive feed-\nback. Roscoe and Chi (2007) suggested that analysis of actual behaviours was\nimportant in enhancing the effectiveness of tutoring. Explaining and questioning\nwere important in reflective knowledge-building, but tutors tended to persist with\nsimple knowledge-telling.\n\nimplementation integrity concerned descriptive features of\n\nImplementation integrity\nImplementation integrity (or implementation fidelity) is the extent to which an inter-\nvention is delivered according to the description of good practice in the technical\nprotocol or manual for it (Arkoosh et al., 2007; Gresham, 1989). Gresham argued\nthat\nthe programme\n(complexity of treatments, time required to implement, materials/resources, number\nof treatment agents) and technical issues (specification of treatment components and\ndeviations from treatment protocols), and are best determined by direct observation.\nArkoosh et al. (2007) expressed this in more relative terms \u2013 what are the parame-\nters required to achieve desired treatment outcomes \u2013 how much integrity is\n\n\fEducational Psychology\n\n577\n\nenough? Thus, implementation integrity might constitute a continuum which relates\nto a continuum in outcomes (and indeed in implementation cost). These authors\nfound that a high level of treatment integrity was required for treatment success.\nHowever, implementation of all elements of a treatment plan may not be critical to\nsuch success (Gansle & McMahon, 1997).\n\nGenerally, higher implementation integrity is associated with higher outcomes\n(e.g. Noell et al., 2005), but this relationship is not necessarily strong or continuous.\nThese authors note that intervention implementation was typically initially high, but\ndecreased over time, and in many instances the deterioration was precipitous.\nClearly, a purely outcome evaluation with positive or negative results would not be\nable to claim that the target programme had actually been evaluated if there was no\nevidence of implementation integrity. This is a critical issue for most response-to-\nintervention models. However, there has been relatively little research on implemen-\ntation integrity, particularly in large-scale field trials. In schools, implementation\nintegrity can focus on teacher behaviour, or pupil behaviour, or both (the latter\napproach is used here). Of course,\nthe more\ndemanding is any assessment of implementation integrity.\n\nthe more complex the procedure,\n\nNature of pre-intervention training and subsequent implementation\nThe extent to which the brief pre-service training without systematic feedback in\nthis study was sufficient to change the behaviour of the teachers raises interesting\nquestions. Duolog Math was new to the teachers, so considerable behaviour\nchange was required. Gilbertson, Witt, Singletary, and VanDerHeyden (2007) gave\ninstruction to five teachers, after which implementation was consistently\nverbal\nlow or exhibited a downward trend. Three subsequent classroom training sessions\nimproved implementation quality, but obviously at a cost\ntime.\nResponse-dependent feedback was necessary to raise implementation in all teach-\ners to the required level. We hoped to be more effective than this in the present\nstudy.\n\nin terms of\n\nthese authors found not all\n\nThe nature of training is important and easier with instructional standardisation,\nwhich can generate higher levels of instructional change in the longer term (Rowan\n& Miller, 2007). However,\nimplementations were\nperfect. Blom-Hoffman (2007) emphasised the importance of involving many team\nmembers in implementation, each taking an element of responsibility, so that\nmanagement was devolved and many players felt engaged in the process, but in a\ntime-efficient manner. In a study of 10 elementary schools, Taylor and Teddlie\n(1999) found that that partial implementation was generally the rule, with more\nchallenging innovations the least likely to be implemented. Teachers exhibit fidelity\nto activity more readily than to instructional processes (Pence, Justice, & Wiggins,\n2008) \u2013 they implement the mechanics of what to do better than the subtleties of\nwhy these things need to be done. These authors found teacher use of targeted\ninstructional processes relatively low even after a year of implementation. Stead,\nStradling, Macneil, Mackintosh, and Minty (2007) found that intervention sessions\nwere delivered with reasonable fidelity, but the teachers did not always understand\nthe thinking behind particular activities, suggesting that training needed to focus not\nonly on content and methods but also on why particular approaches were important.\nUnder pressure of time, generic elements and processes designed to reflect on learn-\ning were sometimes sacrificed in order that core activities could be completed.\n\n\f578\n\nK. Topping et al.\n\nTime is an important feature in relation to measurement, since after training\nteachers might implement mechanics first and develop greater insight into process\nsubtleties over time, but process observation might not occur sufficiently frequently\nto capture this. Some aspects of interventions may be implemented faster than oth-\ners (Bradshaw, Reinke, Brown, Bevans, & Leaf, 2008). Additionally,\ntrained\nschools can show higher implementation integrity, but untrained schools also show\nincreases. Teachers will usually make some change to programmes, both in content\nand in method, and most of these modifications attenuate programme effects. Con-\nsequently, there should be particular emphasis on the key features of programmes,\nin order that the core might be better implemented (Pankratz et al., 2006).\n\ninitial\n\n(2010) used brief\n\nto the use of differential\n\ntraining coupled with individual\n\nThe extent of performance feedback in pre-intervention training might be an\nimplementation quality.

Sterling-Turner,\nteachers with respect\nWatson, Wildmon, Watkins, and Little (2001) found modelling and rehearsal with\nfeedback more effective than purely instructor-directed methods in establishing\ntreatment integrity. Noell et al. (2005) found that performance feedback was associ-\nated with superior treatment implementation and child behavioural outcomes when\ncompared to other conditions. Performance feedback could be used as an efficient\nmeans of improving or maintaining treatment integrity when applied within a team\nmodel (Duhon, Mesmer, Gregerson, & Witt, 2009). Burns, Peters, and Noell (2008)\nprovided structured performance feedback in an attempt to enhance integrity, and\nfound a short-term immediate change, but in the longer term, significant failures\nwere still evident. Teacher goal-setting with written performance feedback about\npupil performance was less effective than feedback about teacher and pupil perfor-\nmance with a contingency of avoiding practicing missed steps (Digennaro, Martens,\n& Kleinmann, 2007). However, these suggestions for extended feedback all imply\nextra input time.\n\nTreatment \u2013 the tutoring technique\nDuolog Math uses discussion between peers to help solve the problem (hence the\nname). Tutoring is always cross-ability, but peer matching aims for a similar and\nmodest differential in ability in all pairs. Too large or small an ability differential\nmight restrict attainment gain in both members of the pair (Topping & Ehly, 1998).\nTo facilitate the discussion, nine interactive behaviours are proposed: Read, Listen,\nCheck, Praise; Pause for Think-Aloud, Question, Make it Real, Summarise and\nGeneralise. These behaviours were selected in accordance with a theoretical model\n(Topping & Ehly, 1998) as suitable for peer tutoring from a much longer listing of\nmath coaching behaviours undertaken by math teachers. Normally, teachers train\ntutors and tutees in the relatively easy first four steps together. The second four\nsteps are considerably harder, and teachers often introduce these one week at a\ntime, devoting a mini-lesson to each.\n\nA description of each behaviour is given below in the language used in the\n\nproject:\n\n(1) Read \u2013 your tutee might be having trouble reading a word problem. If so,\n\nread it for them and check their understanding.\n\n\fEducational Psychology\n\n579\n\n(2) Listen \u2013 give your tutee time to struggle to explain what his/her difficulty is.\n\nDo not just jump in to fix what you assume the problem is.\n\n(3) Check \u2013 check that your\n\ntutee eventually gets the right answer. But\nremember there is probably more than one \u2018right\u2019 way to solve the prob-\nlem. If the answer is wrong read the problem over and try again. Only if\nall else fails show your tutee how you would do it (while you think\naloud).\n\n(4) Praise and Encourage \u2013 give your tutee praise and encouragement often,\neven for a very small success with a single step in solving a problem. Keep\ntheir confidence high.\n\n(5) Pause for Think-Aloud \u2013 give your tutee some thinking time, before expect-\ning an answer. Encourage them to tell you what they are thinking all the\ntime. Then you will find out where and how they are going wrong. Remem-\nber, tutors also need time to think! If you are not sure, say so. You are not\nsupposed to know everything.\n\n(6) Question \u2013 ask helpful and intelligent questions which give clues, to stimu-\nlate and guide tutee thinking, and challenge their misconceptions. Do not\nsay \u2018that\u2019s wrong!\u2019 \u2013 ask a question to give a clue. Ask \u2018why?\u2019 Examples\nof questions are: \u2018what kind of problem is this?\u2019, \u2018what are we trying to\nfind out here?\u2019, \u2018can you state the problem in different words or a different\nway?\u2019, \u2018what important information do we already have?\u2019, \u2018can we break\nthe problem into parts or steps?\u2019, \u2018how did you arrive at that?\u2019, \u2018does that\nmake sense?\u2019,\n\u2018where was the last place you knew you were right?\u2019,\n\u2018where do you think you might have gone wrong?\u2019 and \u2018what kind of mis-\ntake do you think you might have made?\u2019. Try to avoid: closed questions\nwhich require only a yes or no answer; questions which just rely on mem-\nory; questions which contain the answer; the question \u2018did you understand\nindicating the \u2018difficulty\u2019 of any\nthat?\u2019; answering your own questions;\nstep.\n\n(7) Make It Real \u2013 try to make the problem seem real and related to the life of\nyour tutee. Ask the tutee to try to imagine what the problem would look like\nin real life. Some ideas to try: encourage tutees to use fingers, counters,\ncubes, sticks or any other objects to show the reality of the problem; have\nthem draw dots, a picture, a list, table, diagram, graph or map; use charts\nincluding a number line, a multiplication matrix, and a place value chart;\nwith your tutee\u2019s permission, mark their written working out with lines,\narrows, colours, or numbering to help them; have your tutee think of what\nthey have learned before or problems they have solved before relevant to the\ncurrent problem; work through a similar but simpler problem; how can this\nproblem be related to people, places, events and experiences in the home/\ncommunity life of the tutee? (or those of someone they know or have seen\non television); make up a similar problem using the pupil\u2019s own name and\ntry to use everyday language.\n\n(8) Summarise and Generalise \u2013 have your tutee summarise the key strategies\nand steps involved in solving the problem. Point out any errors or gaps, then\nsummarise the key strategies yourself. Then talk about how these might be\napplied to another similar problem (generalised).\n\n\f580\n\nK. Topping et al.\n\nPrevious research on Duolog Math\nThe math tutoring technique used here (Duolog Math) is relatively new and there is\nonly modest literature on its effectiveness. It has proved considerably more difficult\nto develop a math tutoring procedure not purely focused on \u2018drills and skills\u2019 than\nhas been the case with reading. The Duolog Math technique promotes dialogue\nbetween the pair and seeks to restrain the tutor from simply providing the right\nanswer immediately. In this it has commonalities with tutoring techniques in reading,\nbut some of its later (and more difficult) steps are very particular to Duolog Math.\n\nTopping (2005) reported on questionnaires from 30 teachers who had engaged\nin cross-age peer-tutored Duolog Math projects with tutors aged 10\u201312 and tutees\naged 7\u20138 years. However, teachers used math games for the first four weeks, before\nmoving on to Duolog Math for the last four weeks. The majority of children\nshowed improved co-operation with partner (86% of teachers), increased discussion\nof tasks (68%), increased enthusiasm and interest (55%), and increased concentra-\ntion span (50%). A study is reported (Topping, Campbell, Douglas, & Smith, 2003)\nin which experimental tutees were successfully tutored in mathematical problem\nsolving at home by their parent(s), while control children (n = 13) received tradi-\ntional math problem homework, but this seems of doubtful relevance to peer tutor-\ning. Thus, the previous Duolog Math reports are of small, short-term projects with\nself-selected participants, lacking implementation integrity data. In peer-tutored pro-\njects two different tutoring techniques were confounded. The present study dealt\nwith these issues, by specifying technique, considering only peer tutoring, randomly\nallocating conditions, following children for two years and assessing quality of\nimplementation.\n\nResearch questions\nThree research questions were explored:\n\n(1) With what level of integrity was the peer tutoring programme implemented\nin quantity and largely\n\nthe pre-service training was modest\n\n(given that\ninstructor-directed)?\n\n(2) Was implementation integrity greater or less between Year 1 and Year 2 (the\n\nlatter in largely different classes with largely different teachers)?\n\n(3) To what extent were general classroom context indicators associated with the\nquality of implementation of individual technique, both within the observa-\ntional schedule?\n\nThe last question stemmed from a desire to explore whether the individual tech-\nnique was best learned directly from specific training by the teacher, or indirectly\nby percolation from the overall classroom ethos with a good deal of pupil initiative\nand peer observation in the development. The implications for the intensity of the\ninitial training of teachers were then considered.\n\nMethod\nThe present study investigated a math tutoring technique (Duolog Math), a\nstructured procedure but designed to be applicable to any mathematics curriculum\nmaterial available in a school, but particularly mathematics problems. The tutoring\n\n\fEducational Psychology\n\n581\n\ntechnique emphasised questioning, appropriate giving of positive feedback and cor-\nrection of errors. Direct explaining was not emphasised owing to the uncertainty\nabout tutor accuracy. The project trained teachers in this tutoring technique, but this\ntraining was very brief and didactic, since the sustainability of the project was\nimportant and releasing hundreds of teachers for extensive training was considered\nimpractical. Teachers were, however, provided with a detailed resource pack. Then\nteachers were asked to train their pupils to implement their assigned condition of\ntutoring using modelling, practice and feedback.\n\nrare. The\n\nResearch design and sampling\nThe background project took place within a school district in Scotland of mixed\nsocio-economic status with 143 elementary schools. It\nincluded both urban and\nrural areas, and thus schools were very various in size. Ethnic minority pupils\ninterventions\nwere\nwere offered to schools and a majority (n = 125) agreed to participate (several\nof the non-participating schools were changing head teacher or buildings) \u2013 thus\na large self-selected sample that was then randomly allocated to condition. Ran-\ndom allocation was achieved with a random number generator. There was a\ncontrol group for the background project but not for the investigation reported\nin this study.\n\nrandomly allocated reading and mathematics\n\nThe present paper is concerned only with mathematics in the mathematics and\nmathematics + reading conditions, which involved 80 schools. Thus 120 clas-\nses were involved (2 (cid:1) 40 cross-age and 1 (cid:1) 40 same-age) involving 3574 partici-\npants. The intervention involved either 7\u20138 or 10\u201311 year old pupils or both, so the\nwhole classes involved were also pre-determined. In small schools where a single\nclass contained pupils of two or more year groups, pupils not in the targeted ages\nwere included in the intervention or not as the teacher decided, but further data on\nthem were not gathered. Teachers involved represented the full range of age and\nexperience. In some cases teachers participated reluctantly, having been \u2018volun-\nteered\u2019 by their head teacher.\n\nIntervention was in mathematics or mathematics + reading. Tutoring was either\ncross-age or same-age. Intervention was light (once per week) or intensive (three\ntimes per week), of about 20 minutes on task per session. Thus, about 10 schools\nwere in each of the eight conditions, totalling 80 schools. Some children moved\nthese were from a great many\nschools and were excluded (n = 188, 5.3%), but\nschools. A few schools dropped out and some changed condition and were\nexcluded (a total of 10 schools), but as these schools were scattered across condi-\ntions, data gathering was not greatly affected and the influence on the power of the\nstudy was minimal. The intervention was for 15 weeks (January\u2013April), repeated in\nthe second year for the same pupils, many of whom had a new class and new tea-\ncher.\n\nFor\n\nthe present study,\n\nin Year 1 observation of\n\nimplementation integrity\noccurred in 29 randomly allocated schools (out of the 80 participating). In Year 2,\nobservations occurred in a (different) randomly allocated 30 schools (out of the 80\nparticipating). Observation was thus conducted in 59 classes involving a total of\n1770 pupils. Performance feedback was not given to teachers on the basis of these\nobservations. Data gathering occurred mid-intervention in February in both years.\nAll observations were completed within a three-week period.\n\n\f582\n\nK. Topping et al.\n\nTraining\nParticipating teachers received half a day of continuing professional development\non Duolog Math. At least two teachers were invited from every school; sometimes\nthis was the intervention teacher and the head teacher. Training involved a context-\nsetting talk from a senior manager of the school district, an outline of the rationale\nand importance of randomised controlled trials, a talk about the tutoring technique\nand how to organise it, and an opportunity to discuss with other schools in the\nsame condition. It was largely didactic. A pack of detailed materials was provided\nto each school for further study. These materials referred briefly to operational defi-\nnitions and the research background, but were mainly practical materials for teach-\nthe teacher her/himself.\ners to give to pupils and organisational advice for\nSubsequently, a research assistant visited schools on request to offer support and\nsaw other teachers in group \u2018surgery\u2019 sessions. After the intervention,\nteachers\nreceived a further half day of continuing professional development, involving pre-\nsentations from teacher colleagues who had implemented successfully and further\nopportunity to discuss. This was repeated in the second year for new teachers, add-\ning use of a demonstration video and brief presentations from two selected first year\nschools to initial training.\n\nObservation measures\nThe variables observed were either class-wide contextual measures of teacher\u2013pupil\ninteraction (29 variables) or quality of individual pair technique (11 variables), mea-\nsured by direct researcher observation in each class and manual recording onto a\nschedule.\n\nContextual variables were divided into \u2018General\u2019, \u2018Resources\u2019, \u2018Introduction to\nthe Session\u2019, \u2018During the Session\u2019 and \u2018End of Session\u2019 (see Table 1). General\nand End of Session variables thus mostly involved observation of teacher and\npupils, Resources and Introduction involved mostly observation of the teacher,\nand During the Session mostly observation of pupils. These items were recorded\non a categorical scale 1 to 4: not at all true of this class/lesson, partly true of this\nclass/lesson, mostly true of this class/lesson, completely true of this class/lesson.\nThus,\nthe expected result for each variable would be approximately three. The\nvariables observed related directly to aspects of organisation that had formed part\nof the continuous professional development for teachers, and as such had face\nlarge-scale measures of reliability or validity\nvalidity. However, no independent\nwere available.\n\nObservation of the quality of technique of the individual pair was focused on 11\nvariables which were recorded almost entirely as frequency counts (see Table 2).\nThe expected result would be: about two for Reading, Checking, Pause for Think-\nAloud and Making It Real, about four to six for Listening, Questioning and Praise,\nand about one and a half for Summarising and Generalising. These factors were\naspects of the technique and as such had high face validity.\n\nGiven that this was the first study of implementation of this tutoring technique\nand it was not clear what might be of value, a wide range of variables were\nincluded and observations were based on frequencies rather than durations. It was\nconsidered that a further study might focus on a smaller number of variables found\nto be of especial interest and use some measures of duration.\n\n\fEducational

Topping et al.\n\nProcedure \u2013 intervention\nIn cross-age tutoring between two classes of different ages, pupils in each class\nthe most able tutor in the older class matched\nwere ranked by math ability,\nwith the most able tutee in the younger class, and so on. In same-age tutoring,\none class was ranked by math ability, divided into tutors above and tutees\nbelow, and the most able tutor matched with the most able tutee, and so on.\nThis meant that in same-age classes the weakest tutee was helped by an aver-\nage tutor, while in cross-age classes the weakest tutee was helped by the weak-\nest older tutor. Small matching adjustments were made on grounds of social\ncompatibility. Parents were informed of the project by letter, and further discus-\nsions were held with a very small minority of parents. No parents withdrew\ntheir children.\n\nTeachers then trained participating pupils together in the technique and began\nthe project. Teachers were asked to tell pupils about the structure of the technique\nand give a demonstration of how to do it (in Year 1 by role-playing adults, but\nby Year 2 a training video was available). Pairs then immediately practised the\ntechnique with math problems of appropriate difficulty, while teachers circulated\nto monitor, coach and give feedback. During subsequent\nintervention sessions,\nabsence of pupils for any session required teachers to rematch un-partnered indi-\nviduals. Teachers continued monitoring and support (a teacher checklist for this\nwas provided). Pairs kept a brief written record of their math work. After 15\nweeks, children were gathered together and asked if and how they wished to con-\ntinue.\n\nProcedure \u2013 research\nObservation of implementation integrity was undertaken in both years. The same\nresearcher made all observations. She made one visit to each class in the middle of\nthe intervention period. Recording was done manually on a structured observation\nschedule. Each observation continued for the whole of the Duolog Math session (in\nYear 1 averaging 21 minutes and in Year 2 almost 22 minutes) and immediately\nafter it. The General and Resources sections of whole class contextual observations\nwere completed in the first five minutes of the tutoring session. The researcher then\nobserved the whole class and teacher in interaction (for an estimation of general\nclassroom ethos) and also observed one tutoring pair (for purity of technique). Thus\nepisodes of whole class contextual during observation alternated with episodes of\nindividual observation of the targeted pair (the teacher divided all the pairs into top,\nmiddle and bottom thirds of ability and the researcher randomly chose one pair to\nobserve per class). The whole class contextual end of session section was completed\nafter the session had ended.\n\nAnalysis\nContextual results were aggregated at the level of the class, while individual results\nwere at\nthe level of a pair of pupils. Descriptive statistics led to comparisons\nbetween years using paired sample t tests (the random samples being treated as\nequivalent). Regression analysis investigated whether contextual variables related to\nquality of technique in Individual pairs.\n\n\fEducational Psychology\n\n587\n\nResults\nWhole class contextual observations\nIn general, the mean whole class contextual observations for Year 1 and Year 2 were\nsimilar, only 5 of 29 variables showing significant differences between Years 1 and 2\n(Table 1). However, in three of these cases the differences between Year 1 and Year 2\nwere negative. These were: Does the teacher introduce the problem t = (cid:3)2.287,\nn = 16, p = 0.036; and Does the teacher suggest ways to make it real t = (cid:3)2.400,\nn = 16, p = 0.027. Another was negative but indicated Year 2 pupils did better: Do\npupils stop working on problems early t = (cid:3)2.426, n = 16, p = 0.027. Another was\npositive and indicated Year 2 pupils did better: Do pupils do one problem per session\nt = 2.263, n = 16, p = 0.038. The last of these (Comments in the record positive) was\nbased upon very small numbers. Overall then, there was little difference between\nyears. This was corroborated by inspection of effect sizes, which were mostly small\nbut if anything favoured the Year 1 teachers.\n\nIn both years, seating positions, ethos and quietness were observed to be high.\nHigh rates of time on task were evident. Teachers were generally good at monitor-\ning all pairs. Pairings were generally decided according to ability. Mostly, the terms\n\u2018tutor\u2019 and \u2018tutee\u2019 were used. Pairs had a jotter to record their work in. Dairies were\nsomewhat used, but they contained positive comments in a minority of cases. Ple-\nnary sessions were somewhat used, but the observed pair participated in these in a\nminority of cases, especially in Year 1.\n\nHowever, a very modest variety of problems was available and problems\nwere not necessarily levelled (categorised according to their difficulty). Tutees\nchose the problems in a minority of cases. Teacher introduction of problems\nwas poor, especially in Year 1. Reminders of \u2018Things to Remember\u2019 were not\nvery frequent, and teachers rarely suggested ways to \u2018Make it Real\u2019 or pro-\nvided any materials. A majority of teachers had prompt cards/posters available,\nbut a minority of children were observed to refer to these. A majority of chil-\ndren were only doing one problem per session in Year 1, and about half of\nthe children in Year 2 (this was principally associated with the teacher not pro-\nviding sufficient problems for the class). A majority of children in both years\nstopped work early. Crucially, there was little evidence of Summarising or Gen-\neralising.\n\nIndividual pair observations\nThe mean individual pair technique practice quality observations for Year 1 and\nYear 2 were similar. None showed a significant difference. However, in all but one\ncase Year 2 was higher than Year 1 (Table 2, Figure 1), only one effect size was\npositive, and some negative effect sizes were quite substantial. Of course, this might\nbe because the pupils were more mature in Year 2 (i.e. an age effect), but this\nwould be more plausible with regular teaching rather than a special intervention.\nQuestioning was high in both years but higher in Year 2. Reading the Question and\nMaking it Real were about central on the four-point scale. Most children only com-\npleted one problem per session. Praising occurred fairly frequently, but only for a\nsmall number of children. Pausing for Think-Aloud was much higher in Year 2 than\nYear 1, but again not all children were involved. Checking occurred in few cases\nand then at moderate frequency. Summarising and Generalising were recorded for\n\n\f588\n\nK.

Listening was almost never recorded, but this was\na very difficult behaviour to observe.\n\nRelationship between contextual and individual observations\nDid teachers with better classroom organisation obtain better performance from indi-\nvidual pairs? In order to explore whether whole class contextual variables had any\neffect on the quality of practice of individual pairs, for each pupil their frequency\ncounts (fc) on the nine individual pair technique variables which related to quality of\npractice (excluding the first 2 of the 11) were summed (0\u2013fc (cid:1) 9) (averaging them\nwould have been equivalent), yielding an overall index of pupil Practice Quality. Of\ncourse, frequencies varied between variables, so some variables contributed more than\nothers. Each contextual variable for both Years 1 and 2 was then compared to this\noverall index of Practice Quality using linear regression. In Year 1 three contextual\nvariables were found to be associated with higher Practice Quality (all df = 1.27): Are\ncomments the diary contains positive? (b = 0.585, R2 = 0.342, F = 5.207, p = 0.046),\nIs there evidence of Summarising and Generalising? (b = 0.454, R2 = 0.206, F =\n6.992, p = 0.013), and Is there movement around the classroom to gather materials?\n(b = 0.394, R2 = 0.155, F = 4.947, p = 0.035). Are the terms tutor and tutee used?\nalmost reached statistical significance (b = 0.337, R2 = 0.114, F = 3.341, p = 0.079).\nAre prompt cards and posters available to remind pupils of strategies? proved nega-\ntive (b = (cid:3)0.415, R2 = 0.415, F = 5.629, p = 0.025).\n\nIn Year 2, however, a completely different set of variables emerged (all df = 1.27).\nDo the pairs appear mainly on task? (b = 0.443, R2 = 0.197, F = 6.606, p = 0.016)\nand Number of problems completed during the session (b = 0.411, R2 = 0.169,\nF = 5.074, p = 0.033) were positively related to Practice Quality. Are pupils doing\none problem per session? was negatively related to Practice Quality (b = (cid:3)0.437, R2\n= 0.191, F = 6.356, p = 0.018), as would be expected. Two further variables were neg-\natively related: Is there a discussion of things to remember? (b = (cid:3)0.456, R2 = 0.208,\n\n\fF = 7.103, p = 0.013) and Does the teacher introduce the problem? (b = (cid:3)0.438, R2 =\n0.192, F = 6.415, p = 0.017). It is difficult to see why this should be so.\n\nEducational Psychology\n\n589\n\nDiscussion\nTeachers and pupils in both years managed to implement some but not all of the\ntechnique effectively. It is possible that the motivation of the participating children\nwas declining in their second year of involvement (or the random selection of dif-\nferent children for observation might have introduced some bias). However, there\nwas little evidence for this in the observational data. Indeed, the evidence suggested\nthat while Year 2 teachers were very similar in behaviour to Year 1 teachers, the\npupils in Year 2 were somewhat better at implementing the technique (with which\nof course they had been familiar in Year 1). More problems were addressed in Year\n2. This might have been the result of greater familiarity in Year 2 teachers.\nAlthough they received no more continuous professional development than Year 1\nteachers, they had colleagues experienced in the method within the school to sup-\nport them. To what extent this facilitated the transfer of technical information and\nto what extent it facilitated the transfer of a sense of reassurance that the process\nwas not new is an interesting question \u2013 perhaps for future research. The individual\ntechnique variables in five cases aligned with the expectations noted prior to the\nstudy, but Listening was grossly under-recorded, Praise was less than expected, and\nSummarisation and Generalisation were lower than expected. These findings may\nbe considered generalisable to non-ethnic-minority pupils aged 7\u20138 and 10\u201311 in\nelementary schools of all sizes elsewhere in the country.\n\nLimitations\nThe unavailability of non-experimental schools using the technique did not permit\nthe extensive piloting of the observation schedule, although one part of it was based\non aspects of classroom organisation in which teachers were trained and the other\nmirrored exactly the elements of the individual technique, so both had high face\nvalidity. Reliability and validity of the observation scales was not established, and\nthis is necessary in the future. The consistency of the single researcher conducting\nthe observations is not known, which could have been addressed through involve-\nment of a second observer in a proportion of classrooms (albeit at a cost). It would\nhave been possible to conduct post hoc reliability analyses if the observed pupils\nhad been the same in Year 1 and Year 2, but this was not the case. Similarly, it\nwould have been possible to analyse for systematic observer drift across the two\nyears, a potential explanation for some of the differences in pupil behaviours\nobserved across the two years. Certainly, comparing random samples (but not the\nsame pupils) in Years 1 and 2 potentially introduced other confounding variables\ninto the analysis.\n\nRelationship to literature\nRelating these findings back to the literature is informative. A high degree of instruc-\ntional standardisation was attempted by coupling the training with a detailed resource\npack (Rowan & Miller, 2007). Training attempted to establish teams within schools\n(Blom-Hoffman, 2007), but might not always have been successful. Key features of\n\n\f590\n\nK. Topping et al.\n\nindividual technique were emphasised (Pankratz et al., 2006) \u2013 nine points to remem-\nber with some harder than others. Researchers worked with teachers on implementa-\ntion, but not with all teachers and largely on the teacher\u2019s definition of the problem.\nThere was no performance feedback based on direct observation, either short-term or\npersistent (Duhon et al., 2009). Brief didactic methods were used in training the teach-\ners, even though less effective than lengthier (and costlier) modelling, practice and\nfeedback. However, the teachers were to train the pupils by the latter method. Partial\nimplementation is common and this study was no different (Taylor & Teddlie, 1999).\nTeachers tended to implement the elements of the technique that were less challenging\nfaster and under-emphasised the more complex instructional processes of Summaris-\ning and Generalising \u2013 of course this is not surprising.\n\nFuture research\nFuture research should explore variations in the length and type of training to ascer-\ntain relative influence on implementation integrity. Variables with surprising nega-\ntive associations should be further explored. Comparisons of cost-effectiveness of\ndifferent intensities of training would become possible. Key elements of procedure\nshould be emphasised. Collecting implementation integrity data on all participants\nwould be advantageous. There is a case for collecting such data on more than one\noccasion. Reliability and validity of the observation scales and inter-rater reliability\nshould be established. Replication elsewhere on this scale would be advantageous.\nCollecting outcome data and relating it to implementation integrity data would be\nvaluable. In terms of analysis, hierarchical linear modelling would be useful to\nexplore effects for pupils nested in classrooms nested in conditions, but large num-\nbers would be necessary.\n\nPractice implications\nTutoring in this form can be implemented as a result of very brief training for\nteachers, but less than perfectly. Training for teachers involving modelling, practice\nand feedback should be considered, although this would take more time and cost.\nFurther training should focus on those parts which teachers appeared to find hardest\nto implement. Many problems should be available and problems should be levelled.\nTeacher behaviours in Introducing the problem, suggesting ways to Make it Real,\nand holding Plenary Sessions should be focused upon. Summarising and Generalis-\ning especially need further emphasis. Teachers should mention things to remember\nand include their comments in diary records. Pupils should complete more than one\nproblem per session and not complete before time is up. Listening, Praising and\nChecking require more consistent implementation. Organisational options (same-age\nor cross-age; light or intensive) are available for teachers constrained by their cir-\ncumstances. The technique may work in ways other than merely increasing the\namount of practice in math, including inducing social and emotional changes in the\nchildren. These variables are being studied in further research on this project.\n\nConclusions\nYear 1 and Year 2 implementation observations were somewhat similar, indicating\npartial implementation in both years, although somewhat better for pupils in Year 2.\n\n\fEducational Psychology\n\n591\n\nSeating positions, ethos, quietness, high time on task, teacher monitoring of pairs\nand pairings decided according to ability were relatively high. However, problem\navailability was difficult and problems were not likely to be levelled. There were\ndeficits in: teachers introducing the problem, suggesting ways to make it real, pro-\nviding additional other problems and holding plenary sessions. Crucially, there was\nvery little Summarising or Generalising. Many pupils completed only one problem\nper session, often before time was up.\n\nConsidering to what extent contextual variables could predict individual vari-\nables, those positively related included: Are comments the diary contains positive,\nIs there movement around the classroom to gather materials, Do the pairs appear\nmainly on task and Number of problems completed during the session. Variables\nnegatively related (as expected) included: Are pupils doing one problem per ses-\nsion. These should be borne in mind by teachers seeking to determine to what\nextent classroom variables can compensate for specific training.\n\nThus, with regard to the research questions:\n\n(1) The tutoring technique was only partly implemented. Some aspects were\ndone well, others poorly. Thus, the brief and largely instructor-directed train-\ning for teachers appeared to have partial effects.\n\n(2) The peer tutoring programme was implemented with similar integrity in Year\n1 and Year 2, but Year 2 was somewhat better for pupil implementation\n(with largely different teachers).\n\n(3) Some General classroom context indicators were associated with quality of\nimplementation of individual tutoring technique behaviours, both within the\nobservational schedule. However, some were negative as well as positive. It\nmust be concluded that this association was weak and mixed.\n\nThere are implications here for the quantity and quality of training. It seems\nlikely that two half days of pre-training for teachers including modelling, practice\nand feedback would have been more effective than the single half day of pre-train-\ning offered, without making the intervention so time-intensive for teachers that it\nbecame cost-ineffective.\n\nReferences\nArkoosh, M.K., Derby, K.M., Wacker, D.P., Berg, W., McLaughlin, T.F., & Barretto, A.

Introduction\n\nMore than two out of every five students who enrolled in college in\n2007 failed to graduate by 2013. Even at selective four-year institu-\ntions, more than one-third of students did not graduate in six years\n(National Center for Education Statistics, 2014).1 Studying is a funda-\nmental input for student success in college, yet many students study less\nthan necessary to progress to graduation (Beattie, Lalibert, Michaud-\nLeclerc, & Oreopoulos, 2017). University students who procrastinate, as\nmeasured by self-reported cramming for exams (Beattie, Lalibert, &\nOreopoulos, 2016) or small delays in course enrollment (Banerjee &\nDuflo, 2014; De Paola & Scoppa, 2015; Novarese & Di Giovinazzo,\nand\n2013),\nStinebrickner (2008) and Lindo, Swensen, and Waddell (2012) found\nthat exogenous increases in campus distractions (video games owned by\na randomly assigned roommate and the success of the university foot-\nball team, respectively) led students to study less and earn lower grades.\nYet little experimental or quasi-experimental evidence exists on how to\nchange study habits.\n\nhave worse\n\nStinebrickner\n\noutcomes.\n\nacademic\n\nPeer tutoring offers one approach to change study habits and im-\nprove student outcomes in higher education. This paper evaluates a\n\nrandomized experiment that advertised peer tutoring services to college\nstudents via postcard. The experiment varied the messages used to\nencourage students to attend tutoring, including framing tutoring as a\npositive social norm or offering small financial incentives to overcome\nresistance to attendance. We compare these messages to a benchmark\npostcard that only provided information about tutoring, and to a pure\ncontrol group that received no advertising.\n\nWe find that advertising increased tutoring attendance by seven\npercentage points, or 23% of the control group mean. Moreover, the\nexperiment increased attendance at multiple tutoring sessions by 6\npercentage points, nearly the same magnitude as the effect on atten-\ndance at a single session. This finding suggests durable changes in study\nbehavior for a simple and inexpensive intervention.\n\nComparing tutoring take-up across postcards, we find no significant\ndifferences across messages. At first glance, this finding suggests that\nstudents responded to the informational content of the advertisements.\nHowever, further exploration reveals similar responses to the postcards\nacross class years, which is not entirely consistent with the informa-\ntional mechanism, as we expect older students to be more aware of\ntutoring services prior to postcard receipt. We also find that students\nmore prone to procrastination, as measured by delays in course\n\nWe would like to thank three anonymous referees, Ryland Bell, Joshua Goodman, Alan Griffith, David Gruber, Dave Marcotte, Julie Maxfield, Philip Oreopoulos, Paul Thompson, and\nseminar participants at the Association for Education Finance and Policy 42nd Annual Conference (AEFP), the Association for Public Policy Analysis & Management (APPAM) 38th\nAnnual Fall Research Conference, 2nd Annual Pacfic Northwest Labor Workshop, and Oregon State University for many excellent comments.

Tutoring take-up therefore appears unrelated to in-\nformation alone or to students\u2019 propensity to procrastinate rather than\nstudy. Instead, the evidence suggests that simply making the existence\nof tutoring services salient induced more students to attend.\n\nWhen using the random variation in postcard receipt as an instru-\nment, we find no evidence that tutoring altered student grades. This\nfinding is consistent with substitution of tutoring with an equally ef-\nfective alternative form of study, or with substitution of study effort\nfrom untutored to tutored courses, leaving overall grades unchanged.\nOur null findings on grades are also consistent with the potential in-\neffectiveness of tutoring as a study strategy among the subpopulation of\nstudents induced to attend tutoring through the postcard. Nonetheless,\nour findings on increased attendance at multiple tutoring sessions\nsuggests that students valued the service. Moreover, point estimates of\nthe effect of tutoring on student grades are too imprecise to rule out\npositive effects.\n\nUniversities have employed a range of efforts to increase retention,\nincluding better targeting of financial aid, remedial courses, and in-\ncreased advising. Between 1987 and 2008, expenditure on student\nservices, of which tutoring is a part, grew at nearly double the rate of\ninstructional expenditures across every higher education institutional\ncategory (Ehrenberg, 2012, p. 205). Peer tutoring offers at least two\nadvantages relative to other student services. First, it is low cost. Be-\ncause tutors are also students, they can be hired at the relatively low\nprevailing wage of student workers. Second, tutoring engages students\nin behavior directly intended to increase their academic performance. It\ncan therefore complement other efforts, such as removing financial\nbarriers or advising, intended to promote student success.\n\nWe make three main contributions to the literature on improving\nstudent outcomes in higher education. First, we demonstrate that a low-\ncost, one-time intervention to promote peer tutoring can meaningfully\nalter study behavior. Four prior studies (Angrist, Lang, & Oreopoulos,\n2009; ideas42, 2015; Paloyo, Rogan, & Siminski, 2016; Parkinson,\n2009)\u2014conducted at an Irish university, a Canadian university, a\ncommunity college in the United States, and an Australian university,\nrespectively\u2014have evaluated peer tutoring using an experimental de-\nsign.2 As in our work, each of these studies found that randomly en-\ncouraging students to attend peer tutoring sessions increased take-up.3\nAlso as in our work, three of the four studies failed to find significant\npositive effects of tutoring on student performance.4 We extend these\nfindings to a new setting, bolstering the external validity of the ex-\nperimental results. At $3.32\u2013$14.58 per additional hour of tutoring,\nours has the lowest reported costs among these experiments, yet it was\nsufficient to alter behavior.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, we provide suggestive evidence that the\nchannel through which tutoring attendance increased was not in-\nformation alone or reduced procrastination, but the increased salience\nof tutoring availability. Our work therefore provides new evidence on a\ncommon way that colleges provide individualized academic support\nacross the curriculum at low cost.\n\nSecond, we contribute to the broader literature applying the insights\n\n2 Other studies have found positive effects of peer tutoring on student outcomes\n(Dawson, van der Meer, Skalicky, & Cowley, 2014; Munley, Garvey, & McConnell, 2010),\nbut rely on observational data and may therefore be biased due to student self-selection\ninto tutoring.\n\n3 Instead of providing randomized encouragement, Parkinson (2009) randomly as-\n\nsigned students to receive tutoring within sections of particular classes.\n\n4 The exception is Parkinson (2009), which studied a sample of 67 students at an Irish\nuniversity assigned to tutoring in specific courses, rather than to general tutoring services,\nas in the other studies including ours. Parkinson (2009) also reclassified students who did\nnot comply with treatment as members of the control group, introducing potential bias in\nthe estimated grade effects. Angrist et al. (2009) studied a program that bundled peer\nadvising and tutoring at a Canadian university. They found positive effects on student\ngrades only when the intervention was combined with a large financial incentive re-\nquiring students to maintain high grades in exchange for a scholarship.\n\nof behavioral economics to education (Koch, Nafziger, & Nielsen, 2015;\nLavecchia, Liu, & Oreopoulos, 2014). Specifically, we provide evidence\nconsistent with the presence of present bias and social stigma among\nstudents. Studying, either alone or with a tutor, has salient and im-\nmediate costs, with distant and uncertain future benefits. Students with\na bias for present utility may therefore make suboptimal studying\nchoices. Making the availability or benefits of tutoring more salient\nmight counter present bias and increase investments.\n\nAnother behavioral explanation for suboptimal human capital in-\nvestment is student concern about identity. Feelings of social exclusion\ncan decrease utility (Akerlof & Kranton, 2002) and reduce cognitive\nperformance (Baumeister, Twenge, & Nuss, 2002). If students place\nhigh value on perceived intellectual ability, then seeking assistance\nthrough tutoring could carry a stigma that leads to its underuse. On the\nother hand, interventions to increase a sense of belonging can improve\nacademic performance (Walton & Cohen, 2007; 2011). One treatment\narm of our study addresses stigma by framing tutoring as a strategy\nused by successful students.\n\nThird, our work is part of a burgeoning literature on nud-\nges\u2014changes to the presentation of choices that do not meaningfully\nalter costs or benefits (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008)\u2014in higher education\n(ideas42, 2016). These nudges include efforts to increase college ap-\nplications, enrollment, or financial aid among potential college students\ncurrently enrolled in high school (Bettinger, Long, Oreopoulos, &\nSanbonmatsu, 2012; Castleman & Page, 2015; Castleman, Page, &\nSchooley, 2014; Hoxby & Turner, 2013), as well as interventions to\nimprove outcomes among students already enrolled (Angrist et al.,\n2009; ideas42, 2015; Smith, White, Kuzyk, & Tierney, 2017). Nudging\nstudents to attend peer tutoring can serve as a low-cost complement or\nalternative to remedial courses (Bettinger & Long, 2009; Calcagno &\nLong, 2008; De Paola & Scoppa, 2015; Martorell & McFarlin Jr, 2011;\nMoss & Yeaton, 2006; Scott-Clayton & Rodriguez, 2014) and student\nadvising (Angrist et al., 2009; Bettinger & Baker, 2013; Ellis &\nGershenson, 2016; Visher, Butcher, & Cerna, 2011) as a way to promote\nstudent retention and graduation. Our advertising devices are a variant\nof those used in Wilson, Frade, Rech, and Friedman (2016) and in\nFriedman and Wilson (2016), studies that examined how to increase\nhousehold investment in another component of human capital pro-\nduction (preventive health inputs).\n\nIn the next section, we describe the research setting and experi-\nmental design. Section 3 describes the data and empirical methods.\nSection 4 presents results and Section 5 concludes.\n\n2. Program description\n\n2.1. Study setting\n\nWe conducted this experiment at Reed College, an elite liberal arts\ncollege in Portland, Oregon. Reed enrolls 1400 students and has a\nstudent-faculty ratio of nine to one.5 It is highly selective, admitting 35\npercent of applicants, with an average high school GPA of 3.9 and mean\nSAT score of 2060 (95th percentile on a scale of 2400) among admitted\nstudents. The student body is 54% female, with a racial and ethnic\ncomposition of 60% white, 10% Asian, 10% Hispanic, 5% black, 8%\ninternational, and the remaining 7% in other categories. The college\noffers 40 majors, of which the most popular categories are in mathe-\nmatics and natural sciences (29%) and history and social sciences\n(23%). Despite the college\u2019s elite status, 20% of students receive Pell\nGrants, giving Reed a higher share of low-income students than many\npeer institutions (Burd, 2013). The six-year graduation rate is 79% ,\nwhereas many elite liberal arts colleges have six-year graduation rates\nabove 90% (Grove, 2017; US News & World Report, 2016).\n\n5 All data in this section are from 2015 and made available by the Reed Office of\n\nInstitutional Research, unless otherwise noted.\n\n152\n\n\fT.

Postcards for each treatment arm.\nNote: \u201cThe DoJo\u201d refers to the main campus tutoring center, located in the Dorothy Johansen House. The Paradox, referenced in postcards (c) and (d), is the campus coffee shop.\n\nReed offers a range of peer tutoring services that students may ac-\ncess free. Tutors are hired from a pool of advanced students who have\nbeen recommended by faculty members. A tutoring center with a\ndedicated working space is open 9am\u201311pm, seven days per week\nduring the academic year. At the center, students can receive drop-in\npeer tutoring in the most popular courses in biology, chemistry, eco-\nnomics, and mathematics, as well as writing assignments in any dis-\ncipline. Students can also make appointments with individual peer tu-\ntors for one-on-one sessions at the tutoring center or another location,\nthough free sessions are limited to one hour per class, per week. The\ndepartments of biology,\nlanguages, mathematics, and physics also\nmaintain their own satellite tutoring centers that follow the same ar-\nrangements as the main tutoring center. Overall, nearly 250 students\nare eligible tutors, with 35 regularly employed for drop-in tutoring at\nthe main center. During the academic year of the experiment, the tu-\ntoring center served 348 students (25% of the student body), spread\nacross 1707 tutoring visits. Of students who received tutoring at the\ncenter, 69% returned for a second visit and 51% visited three or more\ntimes.\n\n2.2. Experimental design\n\nWe conducted our experiment during the spring semester of 2015.\nAll Reed students were randomly selected to be in a pure control group\nor one of four treatment arms. Students studying abroad, on leave, or\nwho enrolled after random assignment were excluded from the sample\n(explaining the discrepancy between Reed\u2019s total enrollment and the\nnumber of experimental participants). Each treatment consisted of a\npostcard placed in the student\u2019s on-campus mailbox at the beginning of\nthe semester. The postcards, designed in consultation with tutoring\n\ncenter administrators, varied as follows (see Fig. 1 for images of the\npostcards):\n\n1. Information. Provided information about the tutoring services of-\n\nfered at the center and its opening hours.\n\n2. Framing. Provided information about tutoring, plus the message that\n\n\u201csuccessful\u201d students \u201cknow when to ask for help.\u201d\n\n3. Incentive ($5). Provided information about tutoring, plus offered $5\ncredit at the campus coffee shop if the student attended at least one\nhour of tutoring.6\n\n4. Incentive ($10). Provided information about tutoring, plus offered\n$10 credit at the campus coffee shop if the student attended at least\none hour of tutoring.\n\nIn the financial incentives treatments, attendance at any type of\ntutoring (drop-in, individual, or satellite center) would allow students\nto redeem the postcard for the given amount at the coffee shop.\nPostcards were addressed to individual students and tutors checked that\nthe student presenting the incentive postcard to a tutor was its intended\nrecipient, minimizing risk of students sharing incentive postcards across\nstudy arms.\n\nPostcards were mailed to students in early February 2015, during\nthe second week of class that semester.7 Campus mail remains a\ncommon form of communication at the college. Conversation with\n\n6 The campus coffee shop sells goods typically found in coffee shops and is located in\n\nthe center of campus.\n\n7 We chose the second week of classes to distribute the postcards to ensure salience of\ntheir receipt. A disproportionate volume of campus mail is distributed to students during\nthe first week of classes of each semester.\n\n153\n\n\fT. Pugatch, N. Wilson\n\nEconomics of Education Review 62 (2018) 151\u2013161\n\nstudents in classes and in office hours indicates that the vast majority of\nstudents report checking their mail box every day.8 All students in the\ncampus mail system were automatically enrolled in the experiment,\nwhich includes virtually all students. Random assignment occurred\nwithin strata defined by student gender, class year, and academic di-\nvision of their major.9 We assigned 327 students to the control group\n(26%), 312 students to the information postcard (25%), 310 students to\nthe framing postcard (25%), 159 students to the $5 incentive (13%),\nand 151 students to the $10 incentive (12%). More details on student\ncharacteristics and balance tests across study arms appear in the Data\nsection.\n\nThe theory underlying the experimental design is student decision-\nmaking under uncertainty, in which tutoring is a human capital in-\nvestment with uncertain benefits. When considering tutoring, a student\nweighs the costs of attending tutoring with its expected benefits. Costs\ninclude the opportunity cost of spending the time elsewhere, as well as\na potential stigma associated with seeking academic help. The potential\nbenefits include an enhanced understanding of a certain assignment or\ntopic, the chance to learn amongst peers, and the associated academic\noutcomes that accompany each of these.\n\nEach treatment attempted to overcome a different perceived con-\nstraint to student use of tutoring. If students were unaware of the\npresence of the tutoring center but would otherwise demand its ser-\nvices, then comparing the first treatment to the control group will\nmeasure the marginal value of this information. Alternately, students\nalready aware of the tutoring center might be induced to attend because\nthe postcard makes tutoring more salient in their decisions.\n\nThe second postcard framed this information by associating use of\nthe tutoring center with student success and other positive attributes,\nsuch as resourcefulness and scholarly engagement. If tutoring carried a\nnegative stigma\u2014a particular concern on a campus of high-achieving\nstudents\u2014then this framing should improve tutoring center usage re-\nlative to information alone.\n\nThe third and fourth treatments paired information with financial\nincentives. The financial incentive was modest and intended to over-\ncome perceived transactions costs to attending tutoring. For instance, if\nsome students were on the margin of choosing tutoring over an alter-\nnative activity, the financial incentive might induce them to attend. In\nthis regard these treatments resemble nudges rather than changes in\nraffled by\nstudent\nPaloyo et al. (2016), which had denominations of US$735 or US$3715,\nor the merit scholarships offered by Angrist et al. (2009), which were\nworth either US$1000 or US$5000, depending on student performance.\n\nto the gift certificates\n\nin contrast\n\nincome,\n\n3. Data and methodology\n\nDuring the semester of the experiment, tutoring attendance and\nfinal course grades among all students in the experiment were recorded\nin the existing administrative data collection system. All tutoring cen-\nters on campus kept records of student visits.10 We also monitored re-\ndemptions of postcards at the coffee shop among students assigned the\nfinancial incentive treatments.\n\nOur primary questions of interest are:\n\n1. What was the effect of receiving a postcard on demand for tutoring?\n2. Were some postcards more effective than others?\n3. What was the effect of tutoring on grades?\n\n8 Even among students who reside off campus, the majority come to campus every day\nto attend class and to study in the library, including on days that they do not have classes.\n9 There are five academic divisions: Arts; History and Social Sciences; Literature and\nLanguages; Math and Natural Sciences; and Philosophy, Religion, Psychology, and\nLinguistics. Interdisciplinary, ad-hoc, and undecided were combined in one group for\npurposes of the experiment.\n\nBecause we randomized the allocation of postcards, simple com-\nparisons of mean outcomes such as tutoring attendance and grades\nacross treatment groups should yield unbiased estimates of these ef-\nfects. However, to improve precision of estimates and to mitigate any\nspurious correlations between observed characteristics and treatment\nassignment, we also use regression analysis.\n\nTo measure whether the intervention increased the demand for tu-\n\ntoring, we estimate the parameters of the following regression:\n\ntutor\ni\n\n=\n\n\u03b2\n0\n\n+\n\n\u03b2 info\ni\n1\n\n+\n\n\u03b2 framing\ni\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03b2 FiveDollars\ni\n3\n\n+\n\n\u03b2 TenDollars\ni\n4\n\n+\n\n\u03b4\ns\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\n\ni\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i indexes students; tutor is an indicator for tutoring attendance;\ninfo, framing, FiveDollars, and TenDollars are dummy variables for being\nassigned to the information, framing, $5 financial incentive, and $10\nfinancial incentive treatment arms, respectively; \u03b4s is a stratum (gender-\nclass year-division of major) fixed effect; and \u03b5 is an error term.\nIncluding strata fixed effects ensures that the variation in treatment\nstatus is random with respect to these characteristics. We also run\nspecifications with additional control variables, such as baseline GPA,\nrace, and international student status.\n\nThe coefficients \u03b21 through \u03b24 measure the effect of each type of\npostcard on tutoring attendance relative to students who did not receive\nany postcard, which is the omitted category. We also run variants of\nEq. (1) in which we pool multiple treatment indicators into one vari-\nable. In one specification, we combine the financial\nincentive in-\ndicators, in order to check whether offering any financial incentive\nincreases take-up. In another specification, we combine all the treat-\nment dummies into a single indicator for receiving any postcard, to test\nwhether these combinations of treatments have an effect:\n\ntutor\ni\n\n=\n\n\u03b2\n0\n\n+\n\n\u03b2 anypostcard\n1\n\ni\n\n\u03b4\n+ +\ns\n\n\u03b5\n\ni\n\n(2)\n\nWe also examine whether postcards affected whether students attended\nmore than one tutoring session.\n\nTo measure the effect of the intervention on grades, we replace the\noutcome in Eq. (2) with student GPA in the semester of the experiment.\nThe coefficient on the treatment dummy then measures the effect of\nreceiving any postcard on grades regardless of tutoring attendance, or\nthe intent-to-treat effect (ITT).\n\nTo measure whether tutoring altered grades, we use an instrumental\nvariables strategy in which Eq. (2) is the first stage.11 In the second\nstage, we regress grades on tutoring attendance, using the treatment\nindicator as an instrument:\n\nGPA\ni\n\n\u03b1\n= +\n\n\u03b3tutor\ni\n\n\u03b4\n+ +\ns\n\n\u03b5\n\ni\n\n(3)\n\nwhere GPA is student grades and all else is as in Eq. (2). The coefficient\nof interest is \u03b3, which measures the local average treatment effect\n(LATE) of tutoring. In other words, \u03b3 is the effect of tutoring on students\nwho attended tutoring because they received a postcard, but would not\nhave attended otherwise. This coefficient will be positive if tutoring is a\nmore effective form of studying than the student\u2019s alternative use of\ntime. This assumption seems reasonable if this alternative use of time is\nsocializing or a non-academic activity. However, if the postcard leads\nstudents to substitute tutoring for time spent studying independently, or\nto reduce subsequent study time, then the coefficient may be zero or\neven negative.\n\nWe first check that randomization was successful in balancing the\ncharacteristics of students across study arms. Table 1 shows mean\n\n4. Results\n\n4.1. Balance tests\n\n154\n\n10 Unfortunately, we do not have records of the courses in which students received\n\n11 We also tried using Eq.

Tutoring take-up\n\nFig. 2 shows unadjusted rates of tutoring take-up across treatment\narms. Attendance in at least one tutoring session exceeds the control\ngroup mean of 29% in all treatment arms. Take-up among students\n\nreceiving postcards varies in a narrow range from 34% (for the ten-\ndollar incentive) to 37% (for the information-only postcard). Atten-\ndance at multiple tutoring sessions also exceeds the control group mean\nin all treatment arms (24\u201325% among students receiving postcards vs.\n18% in the control group).\n\nTable 2 presents regression estimates of take-up, following Eq. (1).\nIn column (1), we find that students receiving the information-only\npostcard were 7.9 percentage points more likely to attend tutoring. The\ncoefficient is large relative to the control group mean of 29% and sig-\nnificant at the 5% level. The coefficient on the framing postcard is si-\nmilar in magnitude, representing a 7.1 percentage-point increase in\ntutoring attendance, and is also significant at 5% . This result is con-\nsistent with our hypothesis that tutoring attendance carries a social\nstigma in this context, though it is surprising that the effect is not larger\nthan the information-only postcard. Coefficients on the five- and ten-\ndollar incentive treatments are also positive, but not statistically dis-\ntinguishable from zero. When comparing coefficients across treatment\narms, we cannot reject that all treatments had an identical effect on\ntutoring take-up, as shown by the p-values from pairwise comparison of\ntreatment arm coefficients at the bottom of column (1).\n\nTo check whether imprecision in the financial incentive treatment\ncoefficients is due to lack of statistical power, in column (2) we pool the\nincentive treatments into a single indicator labeled \u201cMoney.\u201d The\ncoefficient on this pooled treatment shows a 5.3 percentage-point in-\ncrease in tutoring attendance relative to the control group, but remains\nstatistically indistinguishable from zero. Among students in the fi-\nnancial incentives treatments who attended a tutoring session, less than\n10% redeemed their postcards at the campus coffee shop. These rela-\ntively low take-up and redemption rates suggest that students did not\nrespond to the financial incentive itself, but to the increased promi-\nnence of tutoring in their decisions due to the postcard.\n\nColumn (3) pools all treatments together, as in Eq. 2.

The effects of the information and framing\ntreatments grow to 8.8 and 7.2 percentage points, respectively. The\neffect of the pooled monetary incentive treatment is now 6.1 percentage\npoints and significant at 10% (column (5)). As before, we cannot reject\nthat all treatments had an identical effect on tutoring take-up. Pooling\nall treatments yields an increase in tutoring take-up of 7.4 percentage\npoints, significant at 1% .\n\nWe draw two conclusions from Table 2. First, postcards were suc-\ncessful in attracting students to peer tutoring. This finding is consistent\nwith students exhibiting present bias in study decisions, though alter-\nnative interpretations are possible. For instance, students could be ex-\nperimenting with tutoring as an alternative study strategy with un-\nknown payoffs. Second, none of the treatments were more successful\nthan others in increasing tutoring attendance. This result is somewhat\nsurprising, because the effectiveness of the postcard as a nudge might\nalso suggest that altering the content of the nudge (in the form of the\nframing or incentive treatments) would further increase attendance, but\n\nthis was not the case. We explore the role of information in tutoring\ntake-up in more detail later in the paper.\n\nAnother dimension of take-up in response to the intervention is\nwhether students attended multiple tutoring sessions. Although a nudge\nsuch as postcards might be successful in inducing students to attend\ntutoring once, it would be more surprising if such a simple intervention\nled to more persistent engagement with tutoring. To test this possibility,\nwe re-run the regressions from Table 2 but redefine the outcome as an\nindicator for whether the student attended more than one tutoring\nsession. We report results in Table 3.\n\nResults for attendance at multiple tutoring sessions are similar to\nthose for attending any tutoring session. Focusing on specifications with\nadded controls in columns (4)\u2013(6), we find positive and nearly identical\ncoefficients on all treatment variables. The information, framing, and\nfinancial incentive arms led to increases of 6.8, 6.4, and 6.4 percentage\npoints in attendance at multiple tutoring sessions, all significant at 5%\n(column (5)). Pooling all treatment arms (column (6)), the postcards\nincreased attendance at multiple tutoring sessions by 6.5 percentage\npoints, significant at 1 percent. As with attending any tutoring, for\nmultiple tutoring sessions we cannot reject equality of coefficients\nacross all treatment arms. Although the coefficient magnitudes for\nmultiple tutoring sessions are somewhat smaller than for any tutoring\nattendance, they generally differ by less than two percentage points,\nindicating that the postcards not only induced students to attend tu-\ntoring, but also to continue attending after their initial visit.\n\n156\n\n\fEconomics of Education Review 62 (2018) 151\u2013161\n\nDependent variable:\n\nTerm GPA\n\nT.

Effect of tutoring on grades\n\nTables 2 and 3 showed that postcards successfully encouraged stu-\ndents to attend tutoring sessions. Did tutoring improve grades? To an-\nswer this question, we use the Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) esti-\nmator to regress grade point average in the term of the experiment on\nan indicator for tutoring attendance, instrumenting for tutoring using\nan indicator for assignment to any of the treatment arms, as in Eq. (3).\nTable 4, column (1) shows results from the basic 2SLS specification\nwithout controls. The point estimate on the tutoring indicator is\n\u22120.586, suggesting that tutoring reduced grade point average by this\namount (on the standard 0\u20134 scale) among students induced to attend\ntutoring due to postcards. The coefficient is not statistically different\nfrom zero, however. When adding controls for student demographics in\ncolumn (2), the point estimate remains negative and becomes larger in\nmagnitude, but again is not statistically distinguishable from zero.\n\nA potential confounding factor in these regressions is that students\nselecting into tutoring due to the experiment may have been experi-\nencing a downward trajectory in grades, and therefore would have\nearned lower grades even in the absence of tutoring. Although the re-\ngression in column (2) includes a student\u2019s baseline GPA, controlling for\nthe level of GPA would not mitigate selection on trends. In columns (3)\nand (4), we include separate controls for GPA in each of the previous\nthree semesters. Although this specification will account for con-\nfounding variation due to GPA trends, first-year students and others\nwithout three consecutive semesters of enrollment on campus (such as\nthose who studied abroad) are dropped, reducing sample size.\n\nWith this caveat in mind, in column (3) we find that the effect of\ntutoring has flipped signs and is now positive and small, at 0.066. The\npoint estimate remains imprecise. Adding controls in column (4) causes\nthe coefficient to become negative again, but nearly zero (\u22120.003) and\nwith a very large standard error.\n\nA potential explanation for the apparent lack of effect of tutoring on\ngrades observed thus far is that attending a single tutoring session is\ninsufficient to influence outcomes. We therefore alter the explanatory\nvariable to be an indicator for attendance at multiple tutoring sessions,\nwhich also increased in response to postcards (Table 3). The coeffi-\ncients, reported in columns (5)\u2013(8), retain the same pattern of signs as\npreviously, and remain statistically insignificant.\n\nA further caveat to the 2SLS results in Table 4 is the possibility of\nbias due to weak instruments. Across all specifications in columns (5)-\n(8), the largest first stage F-statistic is 7.36, below the threshold of 10\n(Stock &\ncommonly used to determine\n\ninstrument\n\nrelevance\n\nFig. 3. Power to detect GPA effects.\n\nYogo, 2002).12 Columns (9) and (10) therefore report the reduced-form\neffect of receiving a postcard on grades, eliminating any bias from a\nweak first stage or the need to define the type of tutoring received.\nThese reduced-form coefficients are much smaller than the 2SLS spe-\ncifications, which is as expected since postcard receipt does not auto-\nmatically result in tutoring attendance. The reduced-form coefficient is\nnegative without controls, zero with controls, and imprecise in both\ncases. In sum, we find no evidence in Table 4 that using postcards to\nalter the propensity to attend tutoring affects grades.\n\nTreatment effect estimates in Table 4 are imprecise across all spe-\ncifications. A closer look at the statistical power of the experiment to\ndetect grade effects reveals why. Although a 7-percentage point in-\ncrease in tutoring take-up is meaningful, the absolute number of stu-\ndents affected on a small campus (about 90 students in our sample of\n1259) is too limited to detect effects on grades. Even if the true local\naverage treatment effect of tutoring is an increase of one GPA point\n(equivalent to moving from a C average to a B), the pooled postcard\ntreatment would only have about 50% power to detect this effect\n(Fig. 3).13 Power would be even less, about 45% , to detect this effect\n\n12 Constructing Anderson-Rubin confidence intervals, which are robust to weak in-\nstruments, leads to even wider confidence intervals than under standard asymptotics,\nleaving our conclusions unchanged.\n\n13 We calculate power for a 5% test size by using the observed sample size, take-up\n\nrate, and standard deviations of baseline GPA in the treatment and control groups.\n\n157\n\n\fT.

Achieving 80% power, a common\nbenchmark in randomized control trials, would require a minimum\ndetectable effect on GPA of around 1.4, which would be extraordinarily\nhigh for peer tutoring. In short, the experiment allows for precise\nmeasurement of changes in tutoring take-up, but is underpowered to\ndetect reasonably-sized effects on grades, even when studying the\nuniverse of Reed students.\n\nAn additional limitation of the results in Table 4 is that they measure\nonly whether the experiment affected average grades. Another potential\neffect of tutoring is that it helps students to avoid particularly bad aca-\ndemic outcomes, rather than altering the average outcome. For instance,\ntutoring might induce some students to persist in classes from which they\nwould otherwise withdraw. Any effects on course withdrawal would alter\nthe composition of courses that enter into average GPA between treated\nand control students, changing the interpretation of the average grade\nresults. Course withdrawal is also an outcome of independent interest.\n\nWe check whether tutoring influenced course withdrawal in Table 5,\nPanel A, using the same specifications as Table 4. We define course\nwithdrawal as an indicator for withdrawing from at least one course\nduring the semester of the experiment. Estimates are imprecise and change\nsigns across specifications. These results suggest that the effect of postcards\non average grades is not confounded by course composition effects.\n\nAnother poor academic outcome that tutoring might influence is\nacademic probation. Reed College issues academic warning letters to\nany student receiving a grade of D or below in any course. In the se-\nmester of the experiment, 9% of students received this warning.\nTable 5, Panel B examines whether tutoring altered the likelihood of\nreceiving an academic warning. Again, we find no statistically sig-\nnificant coefficients, with signs alternating across specifications.14 In\n\n14 We have also checked whether tutoring altered other measures of academic per-\nformance besides average grades. We find no significant coefficients across all specifi-\ncations in Tables 4 and 5 when defining the outcome as a dummy variable for whether a\nstudent\u2019s grades fall below the 25th percentile. We also find no significant treatment\neffects when running quantile regressions for term GPA on postcard receipt at the 10th,\n25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles. Results are omitted for brevity but available upon\nrequest.\n\nsum, we fail to find evidence that tutoring influenced grades, either on\naverage or for particularly bad outcomes.\n\n4.4. Heterogeneity in tutoring take-up\n\nThe results in the previous subsection failed to detect an effect of\ntutoring on grades. Yet the experiment clearly influenced student study\nhabits, as demonstrated in Tables 2 and 3. We explore tutoring take-up\nin greater detail in Table 6, splitting the sample by gender and class\nyear to see if different groups of students respond differently to post-\ncards. Limiting the sample to female students in column (1), we find\nthat females who received a postcard were 6.1 percentage points more\nlikely to attend tutoring, although the effect is not statistically sig-\nnificant at conventional levels. Male students responded at a higher\nrate, with a precisely estimated 8.7 percentage point increase in re-\nsponse to the postcards, despite their lower tutoring attendance in the\ncontrol group (21% versus 35% for females). These results contrast with\nAngrist et al. (2009) and Paloyo et al. (2016), in which female students\ntook up tutoring at higher rates than males, possibly because our liberal\narts college setting differs from the large universities in those studies.15\nNonetheless, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of equivalent take-up\nbetween male and female students, so we cannot conclude that there\nare gender differences. Future work might consider how the motivation\nto attend tutoring differs by gender, and tailor advertising messages\naccordingly.\n\nIn columns (3)\u2013(6), we split the sample by class year. Students from\nall class years respond to postcards, with the exception of sophomores.\nThis pattern may reflect changing demand for academic support as\nstudents progress through college. First-year students struggling to\nadjust to college coursework may be particularly receptive to nudges,\nbut could have more ingrained study habits by sophomore year. Juniors\nand seniors have declared their majors and may again be susceptible to\n\n15 The other tutoring RCTs (ideas42, 2015; Parkinson, 2009) do not discuss hetero-\ngeneity in take-up. None of the four prior tutoring RCTs report heterogeneity in take-up\nrates according to the other student characteristics we consider in this section.\n\n158\n\n\fT. Pugatch, N.

If students were responding only to\nthe informational content of postcards, then we would expect first-year\nstudents to have the largest response, as they are least likely to be aware\nof tutoring availability. While first-year students do increase tutoring\nattendance by 11.4 percentage points in response to postcards, the ef-\nfect is statistically indistinguishable from the effects for juniors and\nseniors, who are likely more aware of tutoring. Lower demand for tu-\ntoring among juniors and seniors makes these results more striking.\nTutoring attendance in these class years is less than half that of first-\nyear students in the control group. An alternative possibility, suggested\nby a referee, is that first-year students could be the most aware among\nclass years if tutoring services were advertised during student orienta-\ntion. Although we are unaware of this or other advertising targeting\nfirst-years, in either case we should expect to see a gradient in take-up\nacross class years, which we do not.\n\nThis is not to deny that information played some role in take-up.\nAnother possibility, also mentioned by a referee, is that younger stu-\ndents responded to information about tutoring availability, while older\nstudents responded to more specific information, such as tutoring\ncenter hours or that it was free of charge. Although information likely\nhad some influence, the results suggest that information is not the only\nchannel through which the experiment increased tutoring.\n\nIn columns (7) and (8), we split the sample by registration timing,\nbuilding on previous studies of delays in course enrollment and aca-\ndemic outcomes (Banerjee & Duflo, 2014; De Paola & Scoppa, 2015;\nNovarese & Di Giovinazzo, 2013). In the spring semester of each year,\ncontinuing students are allowed to register for next year\u2019s courses.\nUsing registration data from the spring before the experiment began,\nwe split the sample of continuing students into those who registered for\nat least one class on the day that registration opened and those who\nregistered after this day. Students who fail to register on the first\navailable day, when the most popular courses reach capacity, might\n\n16 We have verified that baseline characteristics are balanced between sophomores in\nthe treatment and control groups, helping to rule out imbalanced randomization as an\nexplanation for these results. Our interpretation of the take-up pattern across class years,\nthough consistent with the evidence, is nonetheless speculative.\n\n159\n\nalso procrastinate on other tasks.17\n\nThe results of this analysis suggest that both groups of students\nresponded approximately the same to the postcard. Although the esti-\nmated effect is not statistically significant for students who registered\nafter the first day that registration was allowed, we cannot reject the\nequality of coefficients between groups. The similarity in tutoring take-\nup between groups suggests that the effect of postcards was not due to a\ndecrease in procrastination. This result also suggests that reducing\npresent bias is not the most likely explanation for tutoring take-up, as\nstudents registering late are also most likely to exhibit present bias and\nrespond via this channel. Instead, the results in Table 6 are consistent\nwith increased salience as a key channel through which postcards af-\nfected tutoring.\n\n4.5. Cost effectiveness analysis\n\nHow many additional tutoring hours resulted from the intervention,\nand at what cost? Conditional on attending any tutoring, students\nin the treatment group attended an average of 5.6 h of tutoring.\nIf we assume that students induced into tutoring by the postcards\nattended this average amount, an increase in take-up of seven\npercentage points among 932 treated students\nimplies an a\n365 hours of tutoring as a result of the\n=\ndditional\nexperiment.\n\n0.07\n\n932\n\n5.6\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u00d7\n\nThe cost of the intervention includes postcard design, printing, and\ndelivery; coffee shop gift card redemptions; tutoring center adminis-\ntrator time; and wages for peer tutors. If we assume that the college had\nto expand peer tutoring capacity to meet all additional demand, then\nwe estimate the cost of the intervention at $5320, or $14.58 per ad-\nditional hour of tutoring demand. If instead we assume that this addi-\ntional demand was met by existing peer tutoring capacity (as is more\nlikely), then we can subtract the tutoring wage of $11.25 from this\n\n17 Consistent with the existing economic literature on small delays in course enroll-\nment and academic outcomes (Banerjee & Duflo, 2014; De Paola & Scoppa, 2015;\nNovarese & Di Giovinazzo, 2013), we find that registering after the first day is associated\nwith lower GPA. We regressed GPA on an indicator variable for registering after the first\nday of registration and the full set of controls for randomization strata and other demo-\ngraphic characteristics. Conditional on these characteristics, we find that individuals who\nregister after the first day of registration have GPAs that are 0.22 points lower (significant\nat the 1% level).\n\n\fT. Pugatch, N. Wilson\n\nEconomics of Education Review 62 (2018) 151\u2013161\n\nestimate, leaving a cost of $3.32 per additional hour.18\n\nThese costs compare favorably to other tutoring experiments, re-\ngardless of the measure used. Angrist et al. (2009) report costs of\n$302\u2013$739 per treated participant, while Paloyo et al. (2016) report a\ncost of $30.72 per additional tutoring hour. Although Parkinson (2009)\nand ideas42 (2015) do not report program costs, they are likely low, as\nParkinson (2009) relied on volunteer tutors, ideas42 (2015) was an\nin-\nemail\ncentives. On the other hand, Parkinson (2009) included students in just\ntwo courses, whereas our experiment included all students, and ideas42\n(2015) likely required greater administrator time to manage its mul-\ntiple treatment arms, repeated emails, and involvement of faculty. We\nconclude that our experiment led to changes in study habits at rela-\ntively low cost.\n\nintervention, and neither experiment relied on financial\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nThis paper reported results of an experiment that used a one-time\nadvertisement to promote peer tutoring at Reed College. Students\nrandomly chosen to receive a postcard about tutoring services were\nseven percentage points more likely to attend than the control group.\nTreated students were also 6 percentage points more likely to attend\nmultiple tutoring sessions, suggesting durable changes in study habits.\nThere were no statistically significant differences in tutoring take-up\nacross different postcard messages. Common magnitudes of take-up\nacross class years help to rule out a purely informational channel\nthrough which the treatment increased tutoring. Similarly, common\ntake-up rates among students who did and did not register for class on\nthe first available day help to rule out reductions in procrastination.\nInstead,\ntutoring resulting from postcard\nreceipt is consistent with these patterns, though the evidence remains\nsuggestive.\n\nincreased salience of\n\nUsing this experimental variation in tutoring attendance, we fail to\nfind any effect of tutoring on grades. One possibility is that students\nsubstituted tutoring for other study time. Students induced to attend\ntutoring may have felt less subsequent need to study on their own,\nleaving their grades unchanged. Data limitations provide another ex-\nplanation. We are unable to connect student grades to the specific\ncourses for which tutoring was received. Perhaps more importantly, the\nis underpowered to detect reasonable effect sizes on\nexperiment\naverage grades, even with individual randomization of all students\nenrolled at the college.\n\nThe intervention cost $3.32\u2013$14.58 per additional tutoring hour,\ndepending on whether we assume that additional tutoring demand was\nmet through existing or new peer tutoring capacity. Regardless of what\nwe assume, however, these are the lowest reported costs in the litera-\nture on peer tutoring experiments.\n\nA shared finding across our study and the prior tutoring experiments\nin the literature (Angrist et al., 2009; ideas42, 2015; Paloyo et al., 2016;\nParkinson, 2009) is that students respond to messages encouraging\nthem to attend tutoring. Our failure to find significant effects of tutoring\non grades also echoes the results of Angrist et al. (2009), ideas42\n(2015), and Paloyo et al. (2016).19 We extend these previous experi-\nments, which took place at universities in four different countries, to a\nnew setting, an elite liberal arts college. The similarities in experimental\ndesign and results with the community college studied in ideas42\n(2015) are particularly striking, given the dissimilarity in institutional\nsettings. Moreover, our low-tech approach using postcards sent via\npostal mail contrasts with the email- and text-based interventions of\nideas42 (2015) and Paloyo et al. (2016),\nAngrist et al. (2009),\n\nsuggesting that the communication medium is not central to out-\ncomes.20 Together, these experiments help to build an externally valid\nbody of evidence demonstrating that university students change their\nstudy behavior when encouraged.\n\nin\n\nto\n\nresponse\n\nbehavior\n\nspecific messages.\n\nMore broadly, this paper extends a literature dating at least to\nLeventhal, Singer, and Jones (1965) demonstrating that students\nchange\nIn\nLeventhal et al. (1965), student take-up of vaccines was highest when\npublic health pamphlets sent by mail contained information about the\nlocation of the vaccination clinic on campus. Because all study subjects\nwere seniors, the authors interpret the results as a response to the sal-\nience of vaccination services, rather than to receipt of new information.\nOur intervention also directed students to take a specific action at a\nparticular location, with similar increases in take-up. The increased\ntake-up in the case of tutoring is perhaps more surprising, given the\ngreater uncertainty about the quality and efficacy of treatment in\ncomparison to vaccines. Regardless of differences in study setting, these\nand other studies of successful nudges show that universities can\nchange student behavior at low cost. To improve outcomes, universities\nshould ensure that they direct students to services with high potential\nfor success.\n\nFuture tutoring interventions might include more directed efforts to\ninfluence study habits. For instance, planning prompts help convert\nintentions into action (Bird, Castleman, Goodman, & Lamberton, 2017;\nRogers, Milkman, John, & Norton, 2015). Future versions of postcards\nmight prompt students to plan to attend peer tutoring on a regular\nbasis. Tutoring might also work best with complementary inputs, such\nas academic coaching (Bettinger & Baker, 2013; Oreopoulos &\nPetronijevic, 2016), peer advising (Ellis & Gershenson, 2016), or goal\nsetting (Dobronyi, Oreopoulos, & Petronijevic, 2017). Future research\nmight also expand the range of outcomes considered, for instance by\nsurveying students on their subjective well-being. In short, the behavior\nchange documented in this study in response to a low-cost intervention\nholds promise for improved student outcomes.\n\nAppendix A.

Mazzotti1\n\nAbstract\nReciprocal peer tutoring can be an effective supplement to teacher-led instruction, but students need to have the tutoring \nskills  necessary  to  teach  their  peers  successfully.  Previous  studies  have  addressed  the  challenge  of  providing  essential \ninformation to a nai\u0308ve tutor, allowing for correct modeling and feedback. The present study compared incidental learning of \nvocabulary words through classroom reading instruction to a combination of incidental learning supplemented with peer \ntutoring. Eight fourth-grade students were trained to tutor each other using a digital recording and playback device that \nprovides audio prompts to nai\u0308ve tutors. Results indicated that students made modest gains from incidental learning and \nmuch stronger gains from peer tutoring with audio prompting. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.\n\nKeywords\npeer tutoring; vocabulary instruction; audio prompting\n\nIn the United States, more than 17% of children (about \n10  million)  experience  reading  difficulties  during  their \nearly school-age years (National Reading Panel, 2000). In \nfact,  on  the  most  recent  National  Assessment  of  Educa-\ntional Progress, the National Center for Education Statistics \n(2006)  reports  that  the  percentage  of  the  nation\u2019s  fourth \ngraders scoring at or above the proficient level in reading is \n32%.  Vocabulary  acquisition  is  important  for  school  suc-\ncess,  especially  in  the  area  of  reading  comprehension \n(Anderson  &  Nagy,  1992),  so  students  who  have  limited \nvocabularies often struggle in the area of reading (Bryant, \nUgel, Thompson, & Hamff, 1999).\n\nAccording to the National Reading Panel (2000), vocabu-\nlary should be taught both indirectly (i.e., through opportunities \nfor  multiple  exposures  of  the  word  in  passages  across  con-\ntexts) and directly through explicit teaching of the meaning of \nwords that will be encountered in reading (pp. 4\u201324). Although \nboth approaches are important to increase the learner\u2019s com-\nprehension of text, an extra emphasis on direct instruction of \nvocabulary may be necessary for learners with low vocabu-\nlary or with disabilities.\n\nRobbins and Ehri (1994) investigated the effects of listen-\ning  to  a  story  read  twice  on  kindergarteners\u2019  vocabulary \nacquisition.  The  Peabody  Picture  Vocabulary  Test\u2013Revised \nwas  administered  to  students  to  assess  their  vocabulary \nknowledge prior to intervention. Based on the standard scores \nobtained  on  the  Peabody  Picture  Vocabulary  Test\u2013Revised, \n\nstudents were divided into three groups: low (standard scores \n= 85 to 99), middle (standard scores = 100 to 114), and high \n(standard scores = 115 to 130). Then each student listened to \na story with 11 target vocabulary words. The stories were read \ntwice to each student (2\u20134 days apart). Results indicated that \nstudents can expand their recognition vocabulary when sto-\nries  are  read  to  them  at  least  twice.  The  authors  further \nconcluded that students with weaker vocabulary skills (those \nin the low group) were less likely to learn new words inciden-\ntally than their peers within the high group. The investigators \ndiscussed  the  possibility  that  teachers  may  need  to  provide \nexplicit  vocabulary  instruction  for  students  demonstrating \nweak vocabulary because they are less likely to acquire new \nvocabulary incidentally.\n\nCoyne,  Simmons,  Kame\u2019enui,  and  Stoolmiller  (2004) \nalso  investigated  the  effect  of  storybook  reading  on \nkindergarteners\u2019  vocabulary  knowledge.  However,  their \nintervention  used  explicit  vocabulary  instruction  within  \nstorybook  reading.  Results  indicated  that  students  with \nsmaller vocabularies outperformed students in  the  control \n\n1University of North Carolina at Charlotte\n\nCorresponding Author:\nCharles L.

In addition, \nstudents  with  lower  receptive  vocabulary  skills  who \nreceived  the  intervention  demonstrated  greater  gains  in \nvocabulary acquisition than students with higher receptive \nvocabulary knowledge.\n\nAdditional research has been conducted examining the \ndifferences between vocabulary acquisition when students \nare  taught  using  various  treatment  approaches.  Coyne, \nMcCoach,  and  Kapp  (2007)  investigated  the  use  of \n\u201cextended\u201d vocabulary instruction during small-group sto-\nrybook  reading  with  kindergarteners.  These  researchers \ncompared the effects of three conditions including extended \nvocabulary, embedded instruction, and incidental exposure \non vocabulary acquisition. The extended vocabulary inter-\nvention included explicit instruction, multiple exposures to \ntarget  words,  and  activities  leading  to  deep  processing  of \ntarget  word  definitions.  The  embedded  instruction  condi-\ntion included providing participants with simple definitions \nof target words when those words appeared in the story. A \nsentence was then read a second time, and the target word \nwas replaced with the definition. In the incidental exposure \ncondition,  neither  target  words  nor  their  definitions  were \ntaught  directly,  but  they  were  simply  read  when  they \nappeared  in  the  story.  Results  indicated  that  the  extended \ninstructional  condition  demonstrated  greater  target  word \nlearning than the other two conditions.\n\nThe  advantage  of  direct  vocabulary  instruction  was \nalso seen for students with disabilities. Jitendra, Edwards, \nSacks,  and  Jacobson  (2004)  conducted  a  review  of  inter-\nvention studies that focused on vocabulary acquisition for \nstudents with learning disabilities. Based on their review, \nthe authors suggested that when the purpose of vocabulary \ninstruction is to introduce novel words and their definitions, \npractitioners should use instructional strategies that directly \nteach vocabulary. Some of the direct methods of instruction \nincluded use of mnemonic devices, direct instruction, activity-\nbased methods, and computer-assisted instruction. Design-\ning effective direct instruction of target vocabulary means \nensuring  the  inclusion  of  instructional  design  principles, \nsuch as conspicuous strategies. Use of conspicuous strate-\ngies to teach vocabulary includes direct presentation of \nword definitions, modeling, and use of full and clear expla-\nnations of target vocabulary words (Coyne, Kame\u2019enui, & \nCarnine, 2007).\n\nAlthough  direct  teaching  of  vocabulary  to  students  is \nimportant, it may be very challenging for the general edu-\ncation  teacher  to  target  this  instruction  and  efficiently \nprovide  instruction  across  students  with  very  different \nlevels  of  vocabulary.  One  way  to  supplement  incidental \nlearning  with  targeted  direct  teaching  and  practice  is \nthrough  peer  tutoring.  Peer  tutoring  provides  increased \npractice opportunities and immediate feedback to tutees. \nRohrbeck,  Ginsburg-Block,  Fantuzzo,  and  Miller  (2003) \n\nconducted  a  meta-analysis  review  of  group  comparison \nstudies  investigating  the  effects  peer-assisted  learning \ninterventions  within  elementary  school  settings.  Results \nindicated an effect size of .59 across 81 studies. Overall, \nbased  on  the  findings  of  the  meta-analysis,  the  authors \nconcluded that strong evidence exists for the effectiveness \nof  peer-assisted  learning  interventions,  especially  with \nvulnerable  students  (e.g.,  minority  students  attending \nurban schools).\n\nThere  are  few  studies  investigating  the  effects  of  peer \ntutoring  on  vocabulary  gains.  One  study  by  Hughes  and \nFredrick  (2006)  used  a  multiple  probes  across  behaviors \ndesign to investigate the effects of classwide reciprocal peer \ntutoring procedures combined with constant time delay on \nthe  vocabulary  acquisition  of  sixth-grade  students  with \nlearning  disabilities.  The  researchers  also  examined  the \nvocabulary acquisition of 16 students without learning dis-\nabilities  who  also  participated  in  the  intervention.  Even \nthough  the  peer  tutoring  was  reciprocal,  dyads  had  to  be \ncarefully planned so that a student with stronger academic \nskills was always paired with a student with weaker skills. \nThe stronger student always assumed the role of tutor first \nduring each session. All of the students with learning dis-\nabilities  demonstrated  mastery  on  two  sets  of  vocabulary \nwords (5 words per set). Two of the 3 students demonstrated \nmastery  on  a  third  set  of  words,  and  these  students  were \nable to maintain mastery for all 15 target words for at least \n7  weeks  following  intervention.  For  the  students  without \nlearning  disabilities,  high  rates  of  mastery  were  demon-\nstrated and maintained for at least 7 weeks.\n\nReciprocal  peer  tutoring  has  several  advantages  (e.g., \nthe  items  address  the  needs  of  both  students,  there  is  no \nstratification  of  roles)  but  may  be  difficult  to  arrange  in \nsuch a way that students provide sufficient support to each \nother  to  learn  the  content.  In  the  majority  of  studies  con-\nducted using peer tutoring as an intervention, students had \nto be carefully paired because the tutor needed to be able to \nprovide correct modeling and appropriate feedback to the \ntutee.  A  few  studies  have  been  conducted  to  address  the \nchallenge of providing the essential information to a nai\u0308ve \ntutor, allowing for correct modeling and feedback (Butler, \n1999;  Heward,  Heron,  &  Cooke,  1982;  Van  Norman  & \nWood, 2008). Heward et al. (1982) used a tutor preparation \ncomponent, \u201ctutor huddle,\u201d to ensure that tutors were pre-\npared  with  correct  responses  in  advance  of  working  with \ntheir  partners.  Butler  (1999)  also  used  \u201ctutor  huddles\u201d \nwithin  a  classwide  peer  tutoring  model  that  was  used  to \nteach sight words to fourth- and fifth-grade students receiv-\ning  special  education  services  in  a  self-contained  setting. \nVan  Norman  and  Wood  (2008)  used  audio  prompting  to \nincrease the accuracy of tutor feedback. They taught kinder-\ngarteners to tutor each other on sight words by provi-\nding  the  tutors  with  word  cards  that  held  an  embedded \n\n\fMackiewicz et al. \n\n347\n\nvoice-output device. Following a tutee\u2019s response, the tutor \nactivated the device to hear a model of the correct response. \nResults showed improved accuracy of feedback for all par-\nticipants when the voice-output device was used.\n\nThe use of audio prompting holds promise for a variety \nof tutoring purposes (Wood, Mackiewicz, Van Norman, & \nCooke, 2007) including providing nai\u0308ve tutors with audio \nmodels of vocabulary words to assist in peer tutoring. The \ncurrent  study  extends  prior  research  by  investigating  the \neffectiveness of an intervention designed to target vocabu-\nlary  acquisition  and  further  examining  the  use  of  audio \nprompting as a support to nai\u0308ve tutors within a recip-\nrocal  peer  tutoring  model.  In  a  reciprocal  peer  tutoring \nmodel, each student functions as both the tutor and the tutee \n(Mastropieri  et  al.,  2001).  Specifically,  we  investigated \n(a) the additive effect of peer tutoring with audio prompting \nto  multiple  exposures  of  target  words  in  passages  on  the \nnumber  of  vocabulary  words  correctly  placed  in  context \nand (b) student opinions regarding treatment acceptability \nof the intervention.\n\nMethod\nParticipants\n\nParticipants  were  eight  students  who  had  been  identified \nby  the  classroom  teacher  as  struggling  in  reading  and \ndemonstrated  below-average  performance  on  classroom \nassessments.  Students  included  four  girls  and  four  boys, \nages 9 to 11 years old. Of the eight students, one was identi-\nfied as having a specific learning disability in reading only; \ntwo were identified as having specific learning disabilities \nin  reading  and  writing;  one  was  identified  as  having  spe-\ncific learning disabilities in reading, writing, and math; and \none was identified as having a mild intellectual disability. \nThe remaining three students were identified by the class-\nroom teacher as needing support in the area of reading. All \nstudents  received  core,  general  education  reading  instruc-\ntion in the same fourth-grade inclusion classroom cotaught \nby  a  general  education  teacher  and  a  special  education \nteacher (fourth author).\n\nStudents were teamed together in tutoring pairs based on \nacademic  and  behavioral  characteristics.  For  example,  a \nstudent with attention difficulties was paired with a student \nwho could keep the tutoring pair focused on the task and \nredirect  the  other  student  as  needed.  Student  pairs  were \ndetermined  prior  to  student  training  and  remained  static \nthroughout the study.\n\nSetting\n\nTraining, peer tutoring, and data collection took place in an \nelementary school within a public, urban school system in \n\nthe  southeastern  United  States  that  had  a  population  of \napproximately  925  students.  Demographic  information \nrelated to the school population at the time of the study indi-\ncated that approximately 48% of students were eligible to \nreceive free or reduced-price lunch with eligibility based on \nfinancial  need.  The  population  was  diverse,  with  50.6% \nAfrican American, 37.5% Caucasian, 4.3% Hispanic, 4.1% \nmultiracial,  2.3%  Asian,  and  1.1%  American  Indian  stu-\ndents.  Students  with  disabilities  represented  9.8%  of  the \nschool population.\n\nTraining,  pretests,  posttests,  and  completion  of  social \nvalidity questionnaires took place in a private office within \nthe  school.  Core  reading  instruction  took  place  within  a \nfourth-grade  general  education  classroom.  Peer  tutoring \nwas conducted outside the classroom in the hallway for two \npairs, and two pairs worked in a separate classroom used by \nteachers providing supplemental instruction. These settings \nwere  chosen  because,  as  is  true  in  many  overpopulated \nschools, small-group instruction often takes place in areas \noutside of the classroom.\n\nPeer  tutoring  took  place  prior  to  the  beginning  of  the \nacademic school day. While the students participating in the \nstudy completed the intervention procedures, the other stu-\ndents  in  the  classroom  completed  nonacademic  morning \nactivities to prepare for the day (e.g., unpacking book bags, \nsharpening pencils, recording homework assignments).\n\nResearchers\n\nThe first and fourth authors implemented the study proce-\ndures  at  the  school.  At  the  time  of  the  study,  they  were \ndoctoral students in special education at a university in the \nsoutheastern United States. The first author was employed \nas  a  school  psychologist,  working  full-time  at  the  school \nwhere  the  study  was  conducted.  The  fourth  author  was \nemployed  as  the  special  education  teacher  in  the  fourth-\ngrade inclusion classroom in which the incidental condition \noccurred. She cotaught with the general education teacher \nduring  several  classes  throughout  each  day,  including \nreading.\n\nMaterials\n\nPretests.  Pretests  were  created  to  determine  which  12 \nvocabulary  words  to  use  as  target  words  for  each  Open \nCourt  (Bereiter  et  al.,  2000)  lesson. A  total  of  10  pretests \nwere created for use over the course of the study. Pretests \nwere printed on paper and consisted of a word bank at the \ntop of the page containing 20 story words plus 4 distracter, \nnonstory  words  and  20  fill-in-the-blank  sentences.  An \nexample of a fill-in-the-blank sentence from the pretest is, \n\u201cShe  always  kept  her  desk  ______  so  that  she  could  find \neverything  she  needed  during  class.\u201d  The  correct  answer, \n\n\f348   \n\nRemedial and Special Education 32(4)\n\n\u201ctidy,\u201d would be in the word bank. The 20 story words were \nselected from each Open Court lesson that would be taught \nduring the next week. To avoid introducing a confounding \nvariable, the 20 story words did not include any that were \nidentified for explicit vocabulary instruction in Open Court \nmaterials. Twelve target words were selected from the story \nwords missed on the pretests. These 12 words were identi-\nfied  as  target  words,  with  6  randomly  assigned  to  the \nincidental  learning  condition  and  6  words  assigned  to  the \npeer tutoring condition.\n\nPosttests. Posttests followed the same format as the pretests \n(i.e., word bank plus distracters, fill-in-the-blank sentences). \nPosttests  included  12  target  words  in  the  word  bank  along \nwith 3 distractors and 12 fill-in-the-blank sentences.\n\nVoicePods. VoicePods (Attainment Company Inc., 2006) \nwere used to facilitate peer tutoring and were purchased for \napproximately  $60.00  each.  The  VoicePod  is  a  portable \ndigital recording and playback system that includes multi-\nple, reusable cards. Each card is covered with a clear plastic \nsleeve that can be lifted to insert a paper square displaying \ntext. In addition, each card has an identification/activation \nstrip across the bottom, and when that strip is inserted into \nthe  pod,  it  accesses  a  recording  of  up  to  10  s  that  can  be \ncoordinated with the visual prompt on the card. The record-\nings  are  activated  by  the  push  of  a  button. The VoicePod \nwas selected because it was transportable, easily adapted, \nand cost efficient.\n\nEight  VoicePod  cards  were  used  for  each  target  word. \nThe text for each card was printed from a computer and then \nput into each sleeve. The text for the eight cards included the \nfollowing information for each vocabulary word (a) the vocab-\nulary word, (b) the definition or synonym of the vocabulary \nword, (c) a sentence using the vocabulary word, (d) an iden-\ntical sentence using the definition or synonym in place of the \nvocabulary word, (e) a different sentence using the vocabu-\nlary word, (f) an identical sentence using the definition or \nsynonym in place of the vocabulary word, (g) two sentences \n(labeled \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d) containing blanks for one word, and \n(h) the correct sentence (a or b) from the previous card con-\ntaining the vocabulary word.\n\nMeasures\n\nDependent variable. The dependent variable was the number \nof target vocabulary words correctly selected for sentences on \nthe posttests. The number of words correctly selected from the \nincidental  condition  was  compared  to  the  number  of  words \ncorrectly selected from the incidental plus peer tutoring condi-\ntion.  Scores  were  entered  into  a  database  that  was  used  to \nconstruct a graphical representation of the data.\n\nInterscorer  reliability.  A  second  observer  scored  40%  of \nthe posttests administered to each child. An agreement was \ncounted if both the experimenter and the second observer \n\nmarked the same item as correct or the same item as incor-\nrect. A disagreement was counted if the second observer\u2019s \nmarkings  differed  from  those  of  the  experimenter.  Inter-\nscorer reliability was calculated by dividing the number of \nagreements  by  the  number  of  agreements  plus  disagree-\nments and multiplying by 100. Reliability of scoring across \nstudent pairs was 100%.\n\nExperimental Design\n\nA simultaneous treatments design (Tawney & Gast, 1984) \nwas  used  to  compare  the  effects  of  incidental  learning  of \nvocabulary words through classroom reading instruction to \na  combination  of  incidental  learning  supplemented  with \npeer tutoring. In a simultaneous treatments design, the two \nconditions  are  presented  concurrently;  however,  the  tasks \nfor  each  condition  are  discrete  (e.g.,  different  vocabulary \nwords). If there is a clear separation in the data paths from \nthe probes in each condition, confidence increases that one \ncondition had a greater effect than the other. In the present \nstudy, vocabulary learned through incidental learning from \nclassroom reading activities was graphed and compared to \nincidental  learning  of  vocabulary  plus  peer  tutoring  with \naudio prompting.\n\nProcedures\n\nPretesting  and  posttesting.  A  pretest  was  administered \nprior to each new instructional reading lesson, and posttests \nwere  administered  at  the  conclusion  of  lessons  related  to \neach  story,  or  approximately  every  5  days.  Pretests  and \nposttests were administered in the same way. Students were \ngiven the test, and the experimenter read aloud each word in \nthe word bank. The experimenter then read aloud each fill-\nin-the-blank sentence. Words and sentences were repeated \nat the students\u2019 request. As each sentence was read, the stu-\ndents wrote the numeral corresponding to the word in the \nword bank they thought best completed the sentence. Tests \nwere  read  aloud  to  standardize  administration  procedures \nand to ensure that deficits in decoding were not preventing \nthe accurate measurement of vocabulary knowledge.\n\nIncidental  learning.  The  incidental  learning  condition \nincluded student exposure to target words during core read-\ning  instruction  from  Open  Court  Reading  (Bereiter  et  al., \n2000). Each Open Court lesson (Bereiter et al., 2000) was \npresented during five 40-minute whole-group sessions. The \ngeneral and special education teachers conducted the ses-\nsions. Students were given repeated opportunities to come \nin contact with target words (i.e., read aloud, read indepen-\ndently) ranging from 2 to 14 times (M = 7.8) across the five \nsessions (i.e., per lesson). For example, timber was a target \nword from Pretest 6, and students had eight opportunities to \ncome in contact with timber during the five sessions either \n\n\fMackiewicz et al. \n\n349\n\nTable 1.

The  Open  Court  sessions \nwere conducted as follows: (a) Session 1: Story background \nand vocabulary were presented by the teacher (i.e., vocabu-\nlary were not target words); (b) Session 2: Teacher read the \nfirst  half  of  the  story  aloud,  and  students  independently \nanswered  literal,  inferential,  and  vocabulary  questions \nabout the first half of the story; (c) Session 3: The teacher \nread the second half of the story aloud, and students inde-\npendently  answered  literal,  inferential,  and  vocabulary \nquestions about the second half of the story; (d) Session 4: \nThe class participated in an open-ended whole group dis-\ncussion of the story, and students were assigned to reread \nthe  story  independently  and  complete  a  study  guide  for \nhomework; and (e) Session 5: Teacher reviewed the study \nguide with the class, and students took an open-book assess-\nment of comprehension and vocabulary questions.\n\nTraining.  Students  were  trained  in  tutoring  pairs  on  the \nsteps of reciprocal peer tutoring during a 1-hour session con-\nducted by both researchers. Tutoring pairs remained constant \nthroughout  the  study.  Specifically,  students  were  taught \nappropriate tutoring behaviors as well as how to give feed-\nback  to  each  other.  All  students  received  step-by-step \ninstructions for both roles (tutor and tutee) because each stu-\ndent spent an equal amount of time in each role. Students first \nwatched a demonstration of the procedures conducted by the \nresearchers and then were given an opportunity to practice \nthe tutoring procedure with a researcher. The tutoring pairs \nthen continued to practice the tutoring procedures until they \ncould  independently  complete  all  steps  within  the  roles  of \nboth  tutor  and  tutee.  Practice  continued  until  mastery  (i.e., \n100%  on  treatment  fidelity  checklist)  was  reached.  During \nthe  first  four  tutoring  sessions,  the  experimenters  observed \nthe students and gave feedback and correction when needed. \nA booster training session was provided to one tutoring pair \nthat consistently left out one of the tutoring steps.\n\nPeer tutoring. Peer tutoring included all of the steps of the \nincidental learning condition with the addition of reciprocal \npeer tutoring. VoicePods (Attainment Company Inc., 2006) \nwere used to facilitate peer tutoring. Each pair of students \nwas provided one VoicePod and six sets of eight cards as \ndescribed  earlier  in  the  Materials  section.  Tutors  used  a \nmodel-lead-test, feedback strategy (i.e., demonstration, pair \npractice,  independent  tutee  practice,  feedback)  to  present \nthe words and definitions to the tutees. At any time, if the \ntutee\u2019s response was correct, the tutor provided praise (e.g., \n\u201cfantastic,\u201d \u201cgreat job\u201d). If the tutee was incorrect, the tutor \nsaid, \u201clisten again,\u201d and the steps were repeated. Tutoring \npairs participated in four tutoring sessions per week during \nwhich they practiced all six sets of vocabulary words. When \nprocedural  fidelity  data  were  collected,  tutoring  sessions \nwere timed. Sessions typically lasted 14 to 17 minutes and \nwere  not  directly  monitored  unless  researchers  were  col-\nlecting procedural fidelity data. Table 2 shows the specific \nsteps used to present each vocabulary word.\n\nTreatment  fidelity.  Treatment  fidelity  was  measured  for \npeer tutoring. The first and fourth authors observed 25.8% \nof  the  sessions  distributed  evenly  across  tutoring  pairs. A \n210-item  checklist  was  used  to  measure  the  integrity  of \ndelivering  peer  tutoring  using  audio  prompting.  Results \nindicated  that  tutoring  sessions  were  implemented  with  a \nmean accuracy of 93.4% (ranging from 75.7% to 99.5%).\n\nResults\nPosttest\n\nTable 3 depicts the mean number of words correctly selected \nby each participant in both conditions. Figures 1 and 2 show \nthe number of vocabulary words correct on lesson probes \nfor each participant.\n\nFor Thomas, Trey, Isabel, and Ginny, there was a clear \nseparation between all data paths when comparing the two \nconditions.  Three  of  the  participants,  Rachel,  Oliver,  and \nUriah, had one probe each wherein scores were the same for \nthe two conditions. The other nine probes for these students \nshowed a clear separation between data paths. Nyla, on one \nprobe, performed better on the incidental learning than on \nthe  peer  tutoring  words.  For  the  remaining  nine  probes, \nthere was clear separation between data paths. Two of the \nparticipants (Thomas and Oliver) participated in peer tutor-\ning  only  once  during  the  fourth  week  of  the  study  due  to \nOliver\u2019s  absence  from  school.  The  fourth  probe  was  not \nadministered to these students.\n\nSocial Validity\n\nA questionnaire was used to investigate the students\u2019 opin-\nions  regarding  treatment  acceptability  of  the  intervention \n\n\fStep \n\nTutor Response \n\nTutee Response \n\nTutor Response\n\n350   \n\nTable 2.

The data indicate that students \nmade  limited  gains  from  incidental  learning  alone  and \nstronger  gains  when  peer  tutoring  with  audio  prompting \nwas added. The measure used in this study was a conserva-\ntive  measure  in  that  the  sentences  on  the  pretests  and \nposttests  were  not  the  same  as  the  sentences  used  for \ninstruction.  When  correct,  the  students  were  able  to  gain \nsufficient facility with the target words that they were able \nto place them in novel contexts. In addition, the word bank \nconsisted of 15 choices in contrast to studies that use maze \nprocedures with only 3 choices, diminishing the likelihood \nthat guessing accounted for correct selections.\n\nThe tutoring procedures used in this study were explicit \n(i.e., students were given the definition) and included mul-\ntiple opportunities to hear and practice saying the definition \nas well as apply the word to context, a level of practice dif-\nficult to provide during whole-group class instruction. The \nresults of this study support findings from previous research \nthat demonstrates the effectiveness of direct, explicit vocab-\nulary instruction (Coyne et al., 2007; Jitendra et al., 2004), \nespecially  for  at-risk  students  who  are  less  likely  to  learn \nnew word meanings through incidental exposure (Coyne \net al., 2004; Robbins & Ehri, 1994).\n\nThe results of this study support previous research on the \neffectiveness of peer tutoring (Rohrbeck et al., 2003) and \nthe use of peer tutoring to teach word meanings (Hughes & \nFredrick,  2006).  Teachers  are  challenged  to  find  ways  of \nreaching the diverse needs of students in ways that are effi-\ncient and feasible with available resources. The gains made \nwith the procedures used in the study are meaningful con-\nsidering  the  tutoring  sessions  were  a  short,  supplemental \nactivity that did not require teacher monitoring. This study \ndemonstrated  a  tutoring  strategy  that  worked  within  the \ntypical  constraints  placed  on  classroom  teachers  (e.g.,  no \nadditional  personnel,  minimal  budget).  By  using  a  peer \ntutoring  procedure,  teachers  are  able  to  extend  targeted \ninstruction  to  more  students.  In  addition,  academic  gains \nwere  realized  for  both  partners,  adding  to  literature  on \nreciprocal  peer  tutoring  (e.g.,  Hughes  &  Fredrick,  2006; \nMastropieri et al., 2001; Van Norman & Wood, 2008).\n\nIn addition, research has demonstrated the effectiveness \nof peer or parent tutoring with low-tech audio prompting to \n\nsupport a nai\u0308ve tutor and improve limited-English-proficient \npreschoolers\u2019  English  vocabulary  (Cooke,  Mackiewicz, \nWood,  &  Helf,  2009)  and  kindergartners\u2019  acquisition  of \nsight  words  (Van  Norman  &  Wood,  2008).  The  present \nstudy extended the use of technology support in tutoring \nto another device, the VoicePod.\n\nLimitations and Future Research\n\nOne limitation of this study related to participant absentee-\nism. Several times throughout the intervention, a participant \nwas  absent.  However,  this  posed  a  problem  for  only  one \ntutoring pair on one set of words because they were not able \nto participate in a minimum of three tutoring sessions nec-\nessary to practice all of the words on the posttest representing \nthe tutoring condition.\n\nA second limitation is that the posttests required students \nto make a selection-type response (i.e., matching the vocab-\nulary  word  to  an  appropriate  sentence)  rather  than  a \nrecall-type  response  (writing  the  vocabulary  word  in  the \nblank  space  of  an  appropriate  sentence).  If  the  goal  of \nvocabulary instruction is to increase expressive use of the \ntarget  word,  a  different  measure  would  be  important.  A \nmore conservative measure would be to eliminate the word \nbank  and  use  a  cloze  procedure  in  which  students  supply \nthe target word to fill in a blank within a context-rich sen-\ntence. Although this measure has many scoring challenges \n(e.g.,  interpreting  student  spelling,  more  lengthy  testing, \nvariability induced by student recall), it might demonstrate \na  greater  difference  between  explicit  instruction  through \npeer tutoring and incidental exposure.\n\nIn the present study, one of the classroom teachers noted \nthat some of the participants began using learned vocabu-\nlary words from tutoring in expressive writing assignments. \nA  measure  that  could  capture  students\u2019  expressive  use  of \nvocabulary would also strengthen future research.\n\nFuture studies could examine various easy-to-use tech-\nnology supports (e.g., computer slideshow software; Wood \net al., 2007) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of \npeer  tutoring.  Moving  to  computer-based  support  has  the \nadvantage  of  easy  development,  easy  storage,  detailed \ngraphics, and very clear audio prompts. Studies that dem-\nonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  peer  tutoring  using  various \ntechnologies  is  advantageous  because  the  constraints  of \nclassroom  settings  vary.  For  example,  the  VoicePod  is \nhighly transportable, so in classrooms where there is lim-\nited access to computers or if tutoring pairs need to work \noutside the classroom, this technology would be beneficial. \nAs new technologies emerge, researchers should continue \nto explore these as support mechanisms for tutors.\n\nThis  study  included  fourth  graders  identified  as  strug-\ngling  readers  or  having  high-incidence  disabilities.  More \nresearch across a range of student ages, abilities, and content \n\n\fMackiewicz et al. \n\n353\n\nareas (e.g., phonemic awareness, writing skills, math prob-\nlem  solving)  is  needed.  Butler  (1999)  found  that  peer \ntutoring was an effective strategy for teaching sight words to \nstudents  with  mild  to  moderate  disabilities,  and  Kamps, \nBarbetta, Leonard, and Delquadri (1994) found peer tutor-\ning to be an effective strategy for students with autism. Peer \ntutoring-related research has also been conducted with stu-\ndents with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities. Peer \ntutors  varied  from  students  placed  in  advanced  classes \n(Collins, Branson, & Hall, 1995) to students with mild intel-\nlectual disabilities (Agran, Fodor-Davis, Moore, & Martella, \n1992). Future research can investigate the benefits of peer \ntutoring  with  audio  prompting  for  students  with  moderate \nintellectual  disabilities  and  determine  if  this  method  pro-\nvides the needed support for tutoring pairs to successfully \nteach each other without needing a tutor who already knows \nthe material.\n\nImplications for Practice\n\nPeer tutoring with audio prompting has advantages for use \nin educational settings. First, peer tutoring can supplement \nteacher-led instruction and provide students with repeated \npractice on new content. A teacher could set up peer tutor-\ning stations, and students could work at the stations while \nnot participating in whole-class or small-group instruction. \nDuring tutoring, students can make several active, curriculum-\nrelated responses in a short amount of time (Heward, 1994), \nthus  receiving  the  practice  needed  to  master  new  skills. \nSecond,  an  audio  prompting  device  allows  tutors  to  give \nimmediate and accurate feedback to tutees even if the tutors \nare  nai\u0308ve  to  the  material  (Van  Norman  &  Wood,  2008; \nWood et al., 2007). Even though prerecorded audio prompts \nand feedback are embedded into the materials, the tutor\u2019s \npresence is still necessary. The tutor\u2019s presence and feed-\nback  can  ensure  that  the  tutee  will  respond  to  each  task, \nunlike an independent activity in which the student might \npassively look at or skip through the materials.\n\nPeer  tutoring  has  enhanced  academic  achievement  for \nstruggling students (Rohrbeck et al., 2003). This study sup-\nports and extends previous studies that combined technology \nand peer tutoring (Cooke et al., 2009; Van Norman & Wood, \n2008)  and  shows  that  peer  tutoring  with  audio  prompting \ncan  be  a  valuable  supplement  to  incidental  exposure  to \nvocabulary through reading.\n\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\n\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interests with respect \nto the authorship and/or publication of this article. \n\nFinancial Disclosure/Funding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or \nauthorship of this article. \n\nReferences\n\nAgran, M., Fodor-Davis, J., Moore, S.

APT was the treatment for\nthis study. Quasi-experimental group comparison design was applied. Two\ninclusive pre-school classrooms were randomly assigned as the experimental\ngroup and two other classrooms were assigned as the comparison group. A total\nof 75 children participated in this study. The ELLs from the experimental group\ndemonstrated significant\nimprovement\nthan their peers from the comparison\ngroup in positive social\ninteraction behaviour, receptive language, and print\nknowledge. The total effect indicated that children\u2019s social interaction behaviour\nmoderately mediated the APT effectiveness on language acquisition.\n\nKeywords: English language learners; peer tutoring; social interaction; language\ndevelopment\n\nBackground\nWith the increase of immigrants to the USA from all over the world, the number of\nyoung children in the USA whose home language is not English continues to increase\nevery year. Within the public schools, over 2 million English language learners (ELLs)\nare in pre-kindergarten through grade 3 classrooms (Abedi, Hofstetter, & Lord, 2004).\nRecent estimates show that about one-third of pre-school-age children come from\nfamilies where English is not the primary language used to communicate at home\n(United States Census Bureau, 2010; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,\nAdministration on Children, Youth, and Families, 2008, 2011). At least 460 languages\nare represented in the US schools and programmes (Hepburn, 2004). Meeting the\ndiverse social and educational needs of our nation\u2019s new generation is a significant\nand timely task for educators and policy-makers.\n\nCompared with their native English-speaking (NES) peers, ELLs\u2019 academic\nachievement has been consistently reported to be lower. The national data have indi-\ncated that in English reading 76% of third-grade ELLs were performing below grade\nlevel, and in mathematics 54% were performing below grade level (Zehler et al.,\n2003). A long-standing issue that has been a concern for special and general educators\nin the past several decades was the disproportionate representation of culturally and lin-\nguistically diverse students in special education programmes (Artiles & Ortiz, 2002).\n\n*Email: yxu2@vcu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2015 Taylor & Francis\n\n\f1588\n\nY. Xu\n\nAccording to Rueda and Windmueller (2006), ELLs were 27% more likely to be placed\nin special education at elementary grade level and almost twice as likely to be placed in\nspecial education at the secondary level.\n\nSocial competence\nGuralnick (1990) defined social competence as \u2018the ability of young children to suc-\ncessfully and appropriately select and carry out their interpersonal goals\u2019 (p. 4).\nHowes and Matheson (1992) defined children\u2019s social competence with peers as beha-\nviours and cognition that reflect successful social functioning with peers. Social inter-\naction with peers is one of the most important areas in which children develop positive\nsocial skills. Young children experience varied learning activities during peer inter-\naction. They also establish positive peer relationships by forming friendships with\npeers during interactions. Research has shown that social behaviour plays a critical\nrole in causing a child to be liked or to be rejected (Berk, 1999).\n\nHowever, because of the limited English language proficiency or different cultural\nbackground of ELL students, their social behaviours may be different from that of their\nprimary English-speaking peers. Most previous studies have focused on interventions\non academic improvements for ELL students (e.g. Gersten & Baker, 2000; Greenwood,\nArreaga-Mayer, Utley, Gavin, & Terry, 2001). Very few researchers have examined the\nsocial interaction behaviour of these children. At the same time, researchers have found\nlinks between social skill deficits in children and delinquency, school dropout, sub-\nstance abuse in adolescence (Greene et al., 1999; Parker & Asher, 1987), and mental\nhealth problems in adulthood (Cowen, Pederson, Baigian, Izzo, & Trost, 1973;\nStrain & Odom, 1986).\n\nThe importance of pre-school years for language and literacy development has been\nwell documented in the literature for English only students and ELLs (e.g. August &\nShanahan, 2008; Genesee, Lindholm-Leary, Saunders, & Christian, 2006). The relation-\nship between children\u2019s language development and social skills also has been estab-\nlished (e.g. Berk, 1999; John-Steiner & Mahn, 2011; Mahn, 1999). However, for\nELLs at pre-school age, very limited studies have been conducted to examine their\nsocial interactions and how their social interactions affect their language development.\n\nLearning context\nChildren may learn differently in one instructional context than they do in the others.\nWhen addressing the specific educational needs of ELLs, educators have debated\nwhether instruction should be primarily in the student\u2019s native language or in\nEnglish, and when to make a transition from bilingual or English-language-only class-\nrooms. However, a more crucial issue seems to be related to how the instruction is\ndelivered to young ELLs (Arreaga-Mayer, 1998). Effective instruction for ELLs is\nnot only reported to include first and second language acquisition, but also involved\nin multiple factors such as expectations, scaffolding strategies, collaborative/coopera-\ntive learning, implementation with heterogeneous groups, opportunities for students\nto engage in extended English discourse, applicability to small and classwide groups,\nsocial acceptance by teachers, students, parents, and respect for cultural and linguistic\ndiversity (Arreaga-Mayer, 1998; Gersten & Jimenez, 1994). Instructional interventions\nwith features of language and culturally sensitive teaching appear to maximise oppor-\ntunities for ELLs to become literate.\n\n\fEarly Child Development and Care\n\n1589\n\nClasswide peer tutoring\nClasswide peer tutoring (CWPT) involves tutor\u2013tutee pairs working together on a class-\nwide basis. It is a form of intraclass, same-age, and reciprocal peer tutoring. Unlike\nother forms of peer tutoring, CWPT is designed to operate only with the children in\none particular classroom or age group. CWPT also differs from other forms of peer\ntutoring in that all children in the same classroom or group have the opportunity to\nbe a tutor regardless of the child\u2019s level of academic skills. The focus of CWPT is to\ncreate equal opportunities for children whose academic performance may be below\nthe grade level to be actively involved in the peer-mediated learning process.\n\nCWPT typically involves selection of instructional content and materials, pairing of\nstudents for reciprocal tutoring, regular changes of partners, immediate error correction,\npoints contingent upon performance, allocation of tutoring pairs into teams competing\nfor the highest point total, public posting of individual and team scores, and social\nrewards for the winning teams (Greenwood, Delquadri, & Carta, 1988). It is designed\nto accelerate student learning by increasing students\u2019 opportunities to initiate/respond\nand thereby increasing their level of academic performance.\n\nAs most of the literature demonstrates, CWPT has been effective for increasing stu-\ndents\u2019 academic achievement and improving the classroom behaviours of students with\ndifferent needs. Children involved in CWPT studies included typically developing chil-\ndren, students with attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n(e.g. DuPaul, Ervin, Hook, & McGoey, 1998), mild mental disability (e.g. Mortweet\net al., 1999), emotional/behavioural disorders (e.g. Sutherland & Snyder, 2007),\ndevelopmental disabilities (e.g. Utley et al., 2001), low socio-economic status (e.g.\nGreenwood, Delquadri, & Hall, 1989), and school-age ELLs (e.g. Greenwood et al.,\n2001). The settings where CWPT has been implemented include special education,\ngeneral education, and inclusive classrooms. Furthermore, previous studies covered a\nvariety of academic content (e.g. spelling, mathematics, social studies, reading,\nhealth and safety) and grade levels (from pre-school to elementary children).\n\nIn spite of the impressive research studies involving CWPT demonstrating increases\nin academic engagement, academic acquisition, and social skills in diverse student\npopulations, few studies have focused on young ELLs. Even fewer studies have\nbeen done to compare the effects of CWPT on young ELLs and NES children in the\ngeneral education setting. Among the very few studies on ELLs, almost all of them\nexclusively focused on children\u2019s language acquisition and academic achievement.\nFor example, Greenwood et al. (2001) used classwide peer tutoring learning manage-\nment system (CWPT-LMS) in the literacy instruction of elementary-level ELL stu-\ndents. August (1987) examined the effects of peer tutoring with the more skilled\npeer as the tutor consistently, instead of the CWPT, on second language acquisition\nof Mexican American children. Similarly, Gersten and Baker (2000) reported the effec-\ntiveness of peer tutoring and cooperative learning on English language development of\nELL students. However, little attention has been paid to the social interaction behaviour\nof ELLs, which is highly related to and interacts with other developmental areas, par-\nticularly for young children before they enter kindergarten (Lau, Higgins, Gelfer, Hong,\n& Miller, 2005; Xu, Gelfer, & Perkins, 2005).\n\nIn the field of educational research, there is a shortage of experimental studies on\nyoung ELLs, particularly on their social interaction behaviour and how it affects\ntheir early or pre-academic development and learning. The relationship of children\u2019s\nsocial interaction behaviour and their early language and literacy development was\n\n\f1590\n\nY. Xu\n\nthe focus of this study. From a developmental perspective, young children\u2019s social\nskills are interrelated with their skills in other developmental areas (Piaget, 1962;\nVygotsky, 1978). From research perspective, recent large scale observation studies\nof pre-kindergarten (pre-K) to elementary children suggested an interaction between\nchildren\u2019s social behaviour and academic achievement (National Early Literacy\nPanel, 2008; Wentzel, 2003). Research also indicated the critical role of instructional\nsupport and emotional support for children who are at risk of developmental delays\ndue to environmental, biological, or social factors (Hamre & Pianta, 2005; Xu,\n2008). Unfortunately, for young children at risk, most early intervention programmes\ntend to focus on discrete skills through formal clinical settings. For example, for\nyoung ELLs, most instructional support has been focused on their second language\nacquisition; their social emotional development has been under-examined, if not\ntotally ignored (Xu & Drame, 2008).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the effects of adapted peer tutoring (APT)\non social interactions and early language and literacy skills of pre-school-age children\nwho are ELLs. APT was developed based on the standard CWPT. APT was modified\nfrom the standard CWPT in the following ways: (a) no public posting of individual chil-\ndren\u2019s performance; (b) reduced number of peer tutoring sessions (e.g. three sessions\ninstead of five sessions per week); (c) changes in pairing procedures; (d) using\ncolour coding (e.g. green for 2 points, yellow for 1 point, red for incorrect) instead\nof numerals to score (e.g. 2, 1); and (e) no public point recording on charts and\nverbal reporting by participating children. These modifications were made to accommo-\ndate children\u2019s age (i.e. pre-school), language proficiency (i.e. ELLs), or level of devel-\nopment (e.g. children with disabilities or developmental delays).\n\nThe hypothesis was that APT was effective in increasing and improving social inter-\nactions of young ELL children in inclusive early childhood classrooms. It was further\nhypothesised that the improved social interactions would be associated and/or predictive\nof ELL children\u2019s early language and literacy skills. Five research questions were addressed:\n\n(1) Is APT effective in improving young ELL children\u2019s social interaction skills\n\n(2) To what extent do young ELL children differ from their NES peers in social\n\nand early language and literacy skills?\n\ninteractions after receiving APT?\n\n(3) To what extent do young ELL children differ from their NES peers in language\n\nand literacy skills after receiving APT?\n\n(4) Do social interactions mediate the effect of APT on language and literacy\n\nskills?\n\n(5) What are children\u2019s and teachers\u2019 perceptions of APT?\n\nTheoretical framework\nTo address the needs of young ELLs, the researcher used the developmental ecological\napproach as the conceptual framework to guide this study. Developmental ecological\napproach addresses both the child\u2019s development as relative to his or her peers and\nthe environment in which the child lives. According to the guidelines for developmen-\ntally appropriate practice (DAP) proposed by the National Association for the Edu-\nthree dimensions:\ncation of Young Children (NAEYC),\nand social/cultural\ndevelopmental\n\nthe DAP includes\nappropriateness,\n\nappropriateness,\n\nindividual\n\n\fEarly Child Development and Care\n\n1591\n\nappropriateness (NAEYC, 2009). The child develops within a dynamic and changing\nsocial and environmental context across time. An ecological system view of early learn-\ning purports that children from diverse backgrounds develop in a complex social world\nand that it is necessary to observe interactions at multi-level contexts and examine\nchanges over time at all levels. To ensure the success of these young children, it is criti-\ncal to integrate individual and contextual characteristics and processes and to examine\ninterrelations among these systems.\n\nEcological theory adds to the traditional developmental approach in that develop-\nment cannot be understood and viewed apart from its immediate context. Children\nmay learn differently in one instructional context than the other. This is especially\ntrue for children whose primary language is not English. For example, Lopez-Reyna\n(1996) examined the bilingual children who were taught with skills-focused instruction\nand those who were taught with a whole language approach. They found that the chil-\ndren taught in a whole language approach were more capable in comprehension by\nmaking connections with their own life experience, whereas the children who were\ntaught with skills-focused instruction were focusing on discrete skills. Peer-mediated\ninstruction provides children an effective learning context that is meaningful for chil-\ndren through reciprocal interactions between each other.\n\nMethod\nResearch design\nQuasi-experimental group comparison design was applied in this study. Four pre-\nschool classrooms were identified as the research sites. Two classrooms were randomly\nselected as the experimental group and the other two classrooms were selected as the\ncomparison group. The APT procedures were implemented 3 times per week, 20\nminutes per time, throughout the spring semester. The APT trained educational special-\nist (ES) implemented APT to the participating children after completing the training\nsessions.\n\nParticipants\nA total of 75 children (39 females) participated in this study. Of this, 60 (80%) parti-\ncipating children were ELLs whose home language was Spanish. Their average age\nwas 58 months, ranged 51\u201359 months. All participants were from low-income families\nand had attended pre-school for at least six months. See Table 1 for demographic infor-\nmation of participants.\n\nThe APT procedure\nDuring the 20-minute APT session, the tutor and the tutee were seated at separate, adjacent\nchild-size desks or on the floor. The tutor was provided with a set of the educational toys or\nmaterials selected by the teacher (e.g. parquetry blocks and picture cards). For example, the\ntutor would ask the tutee to use the blocks to reproduce a picture of a house on the work-\nplace. The teacher or instructional assistant would provide minimal assistance to ensure\nthat the reproduction of the picture was successful. Assistance typically involved pointing\nout relevant physical properties of the blocks (colours and shapes) and stating how they\ncorresponded to particular parts of the picture (e.g. roof, door, and chimney). The\n\n\f1592\n\nY. Xu\n\nTable 1.

When the tutor\u2019s 10 minutes were up, the two\nchildren had to switch roles with the tutee now being the tutor. This new tutor would play\nfor another 10 minutes, trying to build the house with the blocks. During this interaction,\nmodelling was the key from the tutor so that ELLs with limited English proficiency would\nbe able to play both tutor and tutee roles.\n\nTraining procedure\nThe training procedure included four sessions.\n\n. Session one: The ES received a copy of the APT process including an overview\nof APT, session scheduling methods, a time breakdown, materials to use, and\npairing approaches.\n\n. Session two: The ES described and modelled peer tutoring procedures to the\nwhole group. Then she had the group practice tutoring for 15 minutes. Each\nchild had an opportunity to be a tutor and a tutee.\n\n. Session three: Children were assigned as tutor and tutee, working on a list of age\nand developmentally appropriate activities. Two approaches were used to pair\nchildren for APT: random pairing and skill pairing. Each child was also assigned\nby the ES to one of the two teams in the whole group.\n\n. Session four: Children were reassigned by the ES with different partners from the\nprevious session. All children, regardless of their developmental levels or cultural/lin-\nguistic background, should have practiced working with each other as tutor and tutee.\n\nAPT fidelity assessment\nTrained research assistants evaluated the APT implementation by using a 40-item pro-\ncedural checklist developed by Greenwood et al. (2001). These items are grouped into\nthree categories: (1) visibility of APT materials during sessions; (2) adult supervision\n\n\fEarly Child Development and Care\n\n1593\n\n(by ES); (3) child tutoring behaviours. For the first two months, fidelity checks were\nmade twice per month. After the first two months, one fidelity observation was ran-\ndomly conducted each month.\n\ninteraction, peer\n\nMeasures\nThe social\ninteraction observation system (SIOS, Kreimeyer, Antia, Coyner,\nEldredge, & Gupta, 1991) was used to measure the social interaction behaviour of\nparticipating children. The SIOS was designed to discriminate 15 types of social\ninteraction behaviour (positive peer interactions, negative behaviours directed to\nthe peer, non-play behaviour, solitary play, parallel play, cooperative play, positive\nlinguistic interaction, peer initiations of interaction, child responding positively to\npeer initiation, child responding negatively to peer initiation, no response to peer\nresponding positively to child\u2019s\ninitiation, child initiation of\ninitiation, peer responding negatively to child\u2019s initiation, and peer making no\nresponse to child\u2019s initiation). These were further divided into seven positive beha-\nviours, five passive behaviours, and three negative behaviours. The two active beha-\nviours also belong to the positive behaviour category. Three sessions of free play\nperiod were videotaped and the mean behaviours per session were computed as\nthe baseline status of children\u2019s social\ninteraction behaviour. After APT was\nimplemented, every two weeks a free play session again was videotaped. For the\ncomparison group, children were also videotaped every two weeks during free play-\ntime without receiving APT treatment. The recorded videotapes were coded and rated\nas followed. After the first minute of the 10-minute free play session, each participant\nwas rated over four one-minute intervals. For each one-minute interval, the social\nbehaviours of the child were marked as occurred (1) or not occurred (0). This\nprocess was repeated for the second child in the class during the second viewing\nof the tape. The process was repeated until all\nthe children in the class were\ncoded and rated with their social interaction behaviour.\n\nParticipating children\u2019s early literacy and language skills were measured using\nPeabody Picture Vocabulary Test, 4th edition-PPVT-IV (Dunn & Dunn, 2007); pho-\nnological Awareness Literacy Screening-PALS-PreK (Invernizzi, Sullivan, Meier, &\nSwank, 2004); and Test of Preschool Early Literacy \u2013 TOPEL (Lonigan, Wagner,\nTorgesen, & Rashotte, 2007). PPVT-IV is an unlimited, norm-referenced assessment\nmeasuring the receptive vocabulary of children and adults. The measure consists of\n19 sets of 12 items each; sets and items are arranged in order of increasing difficulty.\nThe PALS-PreK was composed of six separate subtests that were individually admi-\nnistered, assessing children\u2019s emergent phonological awareness, alphabet knowl-\nedge,1 and print skills in familiar contexts. The TOPEL is a norm-referenced\nassessment including three subtests (print knowledge, definitional vocabulary, and\nphonological awareness) and a composite score that forms the TOPEL early learning\nindex by combining the scores from the three subtests. This index represents a child\u2019s\noverall emergent literacy skills. Summative data of the PPVT-IV and TOPEL were\ncompleted at pre-intervention and post-intervention. The PALS-PreK data were col-\nlected for formative purpose biweekly. In addition, Child Satisfaction Questionnaire\nand Teacher Satisfaction Questionnaire adapted from the questionnaires developed by\nDuPaul et al. (1998) were completed to obtain participants\u2019 perceptions on the use of\nAPT.\n\n\f1594\n\nY. Xu\n\nData analysis\nFour sets of analyses were completed. The first set focused on group differences\nbetween children receiving APT and children not receiving APT. This set of analyses\nanswered the first research question. Children from the experimental group were video-\ntaped during free playtime at baseline and intervention periods. For the comparison\ngroup, children were videotaped regularly (twice/month) during free playtime after\nthe routine activity, as in the baseline condition. A multivariate analysis of variance\nwith repeated measures was conducted to compare the two groups; significant effects\nwere followed up with univariate analyses. The main effects and interaction effects\nwere analysed through this set of data analyses.\n\nThe second set of analyses was conducted to answer the second and third research\nquestions. This set of analyses examined the group differences between the children\nwho were ELLs and the children who were NES. The hypothesis related to the inter-\nvention was tested in a group design (intervention versus comparison) format that\ninvolved change over time. The repeated measures included three experimental\nphases: pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment.\n\nThe third set of analyses used path analysis to examine whether social interactions\nmediated the effect of APT on language and literacy skills to answer the fourth research\nquestion. Path analysis was a method of testing the validity of a theory about causal\nrelations between three or more variables (Gall, Borg, & Gall, 1996) and was used\nto test the proposed mediating model presented in Figure 1. Parameters were estimated\nusing maximum likelihood procedures. The fit of mediating model was evaluated based\non the comparative fit index (CFI: Bentler, 1995) and root mean square error of\napproximation (RMSEA: Browne & Cudeck, 1993).\n\nThe last set of data analyses addressed participating children\u2019s and teachers\u2019 percep-\ntions of using APT to answer the fifth research question. This analysis allowed the\nresearcher to examine the social validity of APT and help identify its long-term effects.\n\nResults\nThe ELLs from the experimental group demonstrated significant improvement than\ntheir peers from the comparison group in positive social interaction behaviour (t =\n4.98, p < .001; see Table 2) and receptive language skills as measured by PPVT-IV\n(t = 5.04, p < .001; see Table 2). Children from the experimental group also showed sig-\nnificant improvement in print knowledge (t = 4.13, p < .001) and vocabulary (t = 3.99,\np < .005) as measured by TOPEL (see Table 2); however, no significant difference was\nfound between the two groups in phonological awareness (p > .05). The formative\nPALS-Prek results indicated that ELLs\u2019 alphabet knowledge was significantly\nimproved after they received the APT procedure.\n\nFigure 1.

However, ELLs from the experimental\ngroup showed significant growth in early language and literacy skills than their NES\npeers (t = 3.95, p < .05).\n\nThe path analysis model yielded good fit to the data: \u03c72(3) = 10.16, p < .10;\nRMSEA = 0.08; Standardized Root Mean Residual = 0.04; CFI = 1.00. All hypoth-\nesised paths reached significance, with the A-B path showing the strongest effect (\u03b2\n= 0.51, p < .001), the A-C path (\u03b2 = 0.39, p < .01) and the B-C path showing the mod-\nerate effect (\u03b2 = 0.38, p < .01). The total effect indicated that children\u2019s social inter-\naction behaviour moderately mediated the APT effectiveness on language acquisition.\nAll teachers (four teachers and four instructional assistants) reported that they\nenjoyed the procedure of the APT and would consider using it in the future. The\nmajority (97%) of participating children indicated that they enjoyed the procedure of\nAPT and would share it with their friends.\n\nInterrater reliability\nThe social interaction behaviour of the participants was videotaped by the research assistant\nin each of the classrooms. The videotapes were viewed and coded by two observers.\nReliability checks were conducted on the scores of children\u2019s social behaviours using SIOS.\nFirst, Observer A (the researcher) viewed all the videotapes and rated the social\ninteraction behaviour of children from two groups by using the SIOS. Then, Observer\nB (the research assistant) viewed 25% of the videotapes and rated children\u2019s social\ninteraction behaviour using the SIOS. Interrater reliability on the SIOS was determined\nby [agreements/(agreements + disagreements)] \u00d7 100 = percent of agreement. Interrater\nagreement was 99.4% on the SIOS.\n\nThe qualitative data such as children\u2019s verbal statements during the APT procedures\nwere observed and transcribed by Observer A. Then Observer B watched all the seg-\nments including these qualitative data and transcribed them independently. The inter-\nrater reliability on children\u2019s verbal statements was 100%.\n\nDiscussion\nSocial competence not only indicates the social skills of young children, but also affects\nall the other developmental areas because children\u2019s development is all related to one\n\n\f1596\n\nY. Xu\n\nanother across domains. Social interaction plays a significant role in young children\u2019s\nlearning and social skill development that enables children to be active learners in the\ninteraction with peers and adults. Children learn best when they positively interact with\ntheir peers and adults in a meaningful activity (Phillips & Soltis, 1998). However,\nbecause of environmental or developmental differences, some children were not pro-\nvided the most appropriate social context in their learning. Among these were children\nwho are from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.\n\nIn the USA, more and more children with diverse backgrounds have been served in\nthe early childhood education programmes. Among this diverse population, young\nELLs are a group whose primary language is other than English and who are included\nin the general education settings. In addition to their limited English language profi-\nciency, many ELLs are from a disadvantaged background that often disconnects the\nnecessary interactions between the children\u2019s families,\nthe community, and the\nschool (Torres, 2001). It has been a challenging task for educators to prepare appropri-\nate educational environments and instructional strategies in helping these children reach\ntheir potentials in developmental areas. Unfortunately many ELLs have received lower\nquality education in terms of materials, interactions, activities, and expectations (Faltis,\n1997). Among the limited empirical studies on young ELLs, almost all focused on their\nsecond language development (i.e. English; August, 1987; Gersten & Baker, 2000;\nGreenwood et al., 2001).\n\nThe positive effects of APT on ELLs\u2019 social interactions and language acquisition\nsuggested the critical importance of instructional methods and strategies for teaching\nyoung children in inclusive settings, specifically children from culturally and linguisti-\ncally diverse backgrounds. The mediating role of social interactions, as supported by\nthe findings of this research, provides valuable information on the development and\nimplementation of language instruction for young ELLs and children with developmen-\ntal or language delays. Additionally, findings from this research may help policy-\nmakers in determining eligibility requirements for children with special needs due to\na specific learning disability or language delay and therefore potentially reduce the dis-\nproportionate representation of language minority children in special education.\n\nThis research also is helpful in identifying critical factors that affect young ELLs\u2019\nlearning and development, particularly the role of social interactions in their later\nschool success.\n\nA limitation of this study was the small sample size related to the results and\ninterpretation of the path analysis. Based upon the estimated size of the effect (e.g.\nWehby, Symons, Canale, & Go, 1998) and the estimated number of parameters, a\nsample size of 200 students would provide adequate statistical power (Tabachnick &\nFidell, 1996). Therefore, larger sample size is recommended for future studies to\nfurther examine the effects of the APT and the mediating effect of social interactions.\n\nsocial\n\nstudy observed ELLs\u2019\n\nImplications\nThis\nimmediately after APT was\nimplemented. A more conservative design can be developed to examine the long-\nterm effects of APT because the spillover effects of peer tutoring could carry over\nfor at least 24 hours (August & Shanahan, 2008). For example, the observation of chil-\ndren\u2019s social interactions can be conducted the next day after APT is used. When chil-\ndren\u2019s social skills are generalised to different settings, learning occurs more naturally\nand effectively (Filler & Xu, 2007; Hyatt & Filler, 2013). In addition, ELLs in this\n\ninteractions\n\n\fEarly Child Development and Care\n\n1597\n\nstudy were primarily from Hispanic backgrounds. More data are needed to examine the\neffects of APT on children from more diverse backgrounds. Also, the relationship\nbetween children\u2019s social interaction and inappropriate behaviour of ELLs was not\nthe focus of this study. Future studies can investigate the relationship between these\ntwo variables and how it might affect their academic performance.\n\nPeer tutoring is only one of the peer-mediated instructional strategies and it may not\nwork for all children. The message from this study is that children from minority back-\ngrounds have common characteristics in social and academic areas with children from\nthe majority culture. They also have their unique needs in their language development,\nespecially in the sequence of second language acquisition. Adapted peer tutoring, as an\ninstructional strategy, has the potential to help these children learn effectively in a\ndevelopmentally appropriate early childhood programme.\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.\n\nNotes on contributor\nDr Yaoying Xu is an associate professor in Special Education and Disability Policy at Virginia\nCommonwealth University.

The present study\ninvestigates changes in university students\u2019 adoption of metacognitive regulation after\nparticipating in reciprocal peer tutoring (RPT). A quasi-experimental pretest\u2013posttest\ndesign was adopted, involving an experimental (n = 51) and two control groups; CG1\n(n = 24) and CG2 (n = 22). Experimental students participated in a RPT intervention\nduring a complete semester. Metacognitive regulation was assessed by means of think-\naloud protocol analysis. Results indicate that RPT is promising to promote metacognitive\nregulation. Experimental students increasingly adopt monitoring, evaluation, and orienta-\ntion and significantly evolve towards deep-level regulation from pretest to posttest. Except\nfor an increased use of low-level comprehension monitoring, none of the evolutions in\nexperimental students\u2019 regulation could be discerned for students in both control groups.\n\nKeywords Metacognitive regulation (cid:2) Peer tutoring (cid:2) Think-aloud protocol analysis (cid:2)\nCollaborative learning\n\nIntroduction\n\nto self-regulated learning and contributes to an\nMetacognitive regulation is central\nimportant extent to students\u2019 performance (Meijer et al. 2006; Zimmerman and Schunk\n2011).

Unlike most other research, it does not focus exclu-\nsively on a particular regulation skill (e.g. monitoring), but takes an integrative perspective\nwhen assessing students\u2019 metacognitive regulation. It more specifically investigates\nchanges in students\u2019 metacognitive orientation, planning, monitoring, and evaluation after\nparticipation in RPT. By enhancing our understanding of the differential impact of RPT on\nstudents\u2019 adoption of regulation skills, the present study offers direct cues to optimally\nfoster students\u2019 regulation through RPT.\n\nTheoretical framework\n\nMetacognitive regulation\n\nMetacognition refers to both the awareness and active control students have over their\ncognitive activities when engaged in learning or academic problem-solving (Brown 1987;\nPintrich 2004). The first component, metacognitive knowledge, concerns insights of stu-\ndents about themselves as learners, insight into learning strategies, and insight into the\nusefulness of these strategies within specific learning conditions (Pintrich 2004; Zim-\nmerman and Schunk 2011). The second component, metacognitive regulation, refers to\nself-regulatory skills and strategies adopted by students to actively control and coordinate\ntheir learning and performance (Greene and Azevedo 2009; Meijer et al. 2006). The focus\nof the present study is on this second component of metacognition. We distinguish ori-\nenting, planning, monitoring, and evaluating as key regulation skills (Brown 1987;\nVeenman et al. 1997), which unfold over weakly sequenced and recursive problem-solving\nphases (Greene and Azevedo 2009; Winne and Hadwin 1998). When orienting, students\nengage in task analysis to get acquainted with learning objectives or task demands (Pintrich\n2004). This can result in awareness of task perceptions or prior knowledge activation\n(Meijer et al. 2006; Winne and Hadwin 1998). Planning encompasses selecting and\nsequencing problem-solving strategies, allocating resources, and developing action plans\n(Greene and Azevedo 2009; Meijer et al. 2006); either at the onset or during task execution\n(e.g. after a subtask). Monitoring involves the online quality control of problem-solving,\naimed at identifying inconsistencies and optimising task execution (Meijer et al. 2006;\nMoos and Azevedo 2009). Comprehension monitoring refers to control activities focusing\non the correctness of one\u2019s understanding (Pintrich 2004; Veenman et al. 1997), whereas\nmonitoring of progress focuses on the adequateness of problem-solving strategies or the\nquality of students\u2019 progress (Greene and Azevedo 2009; Moos and Azevedo 2009).\nFinally, evaluation involves learners\u2019 self-judgement upon completion of problem-solving\n(Veenman et al. 2005). This can be directed at both learning outcomes and the learning\nprocess (Meijer et al. 2006).\n\nLow-level versus deep-level metacognitive regulation\n\nThe present study distinguishes low-level and deep-level metacognitive regulation, intro-\nducing a more in-depth operationalisation. Low-level orientation is solely directed at\nexploring task demands, whereas deep-level orientation aims at processing task demands\nand activating prior knowledge (Veenman et al. 2005). Low-level planning implies the\n\n123\n\n\fHigh Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486\n\n471\n\ndevelopment of a single problem-solving plan, whereas deep-level planning involves\nselecting a plan after considering various problem-solving alternatives (Meijer et al. 2006;\nVeenman et al. 1997). When students check their progress or the comprehensiveness of\ntheir understanding, they engage in low-level monitoring. Reflective comments on the\nquality of their perceived progress or elaborative, thought-provoking reflections imply\ndeep-level monitoring (Moos and Azevedo 2009). Correspondingly, low-level evaluation\ninvolves checking and commenting on either learning outcomes or process factors,\nwhereas deep-level evaluation implies reflective judgements on both (Veenman et al.\n2005).\n\nOptimising metacognitive regulation through peer tutoring\n\nFostering metacognitive regulation requires direct observation of explicitly modelled\nmetacognitive behaviour, along with explanations about regulation skills (Schunk and\nZimmerman 2007; Volet et al. 2009). Students should further be challenged to internalise\nthe modelled behaviour at the individual level, by practising and subsequently reflecting\nupon a variety of self-regulatory strategies. Additionally, learners should be encouraged to\ndiscuss and control their learning, refining their metacognitive regulation (Schunk and\nZimmerman 2007). Current research centres on modelling by peers during collaborative\nlearning (Volet et al. 2009). During collaborative learning, students discuss meaning and\ncompare their thinking with peers, requiring both regulation of their own cognition and\ncontrol of how peers learn (Volet et al. 2009). Despite growing consensus on the meta-\ncognitive learning opportunities during collaborative learning, empirical evidence on its\ndifferential influence on students\u2019 adoption of specific regulation skills is limited. The\npresent study aims to enhance our understanding of the metacognitive potential of col-\nlaborative learning, by studying the specific impact of reciprocal peer tutoring on uni-\nversity students\u2019 use of orientation, planning, monitoring, and evaluation.\n\nPeer tutoring is characterised by active academic helping and supporting between peers\nin small groups or student pairs (Falchikov 2001; Topping 1996). One peer, the tutor, is\nexpected to take a direct pedagogical responsibility by creating learning opportunities\nthrough questioning, clarifying, and scaffolding (Chi et al. 2001). The students being\ncognitively challenged by this peer tutor are called tutees. Reciprocal peer tutoring (RPT)\nis characterised by the structured exchange of the tutor role among peers in the PT groups/\npairs (Topping 1996). Although the available research illustrates that peer tutoring chal-\nlenges students\u2019 metacognitive regulation and particularly promotes their adoption of\nmonitoring (e.g. King 1997; Roscoe and Chi 2008), possible effects on other regulation\nskills are underexposed.\n\nAim of the study and research hypotheses\n\nThe present study aims to study the changes in university students\u2019 adoption of meta-\ncognitive regulation skills after participation in RPT. Since literature provides evidence for\nmetacognitive learning opportunities within collaborative learning, we hypothesise that\nRPT will have a positive impact on students\u2019 use of metacognitive regulation skills\n(hypothesis 1). During tutoring, conceptual discussions can take place at different levels of\nsocial interaction: the individual, dyadic, and group level (Volet et al. 2009). Conse-\nquently, students experience the need to metacognitively regulate their own, each other\u2019s,\nor the group\u2019s cognition, increasing chances for metacognitive engagement. Because more\n\n123\n\n\f472\n\nHigh Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486\n\nregulatory control often results in the use of profound metacognitive strategies (Chin and\nBrown 2000; Greene and Azevedo 2009), we additionally hypothesise that RPT will\npromote students\u2019 involvement in deep-level metacognitive regulation (hypothesis 2).\n\nMethod\n\nDesign\n\nA quasi-experimental pretest\u2013posttest design was adopted, involving an experimental and\ntwo control groups. Experimental students participated in the RPT intervention during a\ncomplete semester. Both at the start (October) and the end (December) of the semester, the\nregulation skills of individual participants (n = 97) were assessed.\n\nParticipants and setting\n\nThe study was conducted in a naturalistic university setting. The experimental group (EG)\nconsisted of the complete population of 64 first-year students, Educational Sciences, who\nalready obtained a professional bachelor degree (12.5 % males and 87.5 % females).1 This\ngender distribution is representative for the Educational Sciences students population in\nFlanders (Belgium). Unlike other studies (e.g. Cheng and Ku 2009; Duran and Monereo\n2005), the present study did not aim to compare RPT with a different type of student-\nactivating learning (e.g. fixed peer tutoring, self-explaining). Therefore, we preferred not to\nassign students of the Educational Sciences programme with a professional bachelor\ndegree to either an experimental or control treatment, due to ethical reasons. Such a design\nwould imply students being deprived from the benefits of peer-assisted learning, inherent\nto RPT. Alternatively, we involved two control groups. The first (CG1) consisted of 24\nfreshmen in the Educational Sciences programme (12.5 % males and 87.5 % females).\nDespite differences in participants\u2019 age and prior experience in higher education, these\nstudents are enrolled in the same curriculum as EG students. This curriculum aims at\nintroducing students into the basic theoretical frameworks of Educational Sciences and\nconsists of general social sciences courses, specialised pedagogical courses, and method-\nology courses. The second control group (CG2) consisted of 22 first-year students in the\nSocial Welfare Studies programme of the same faculty, who also attained a professional\nbachelor degree (14.3 % males and 85.7 % females). Although these students are enrolled\nin a somewhat different curriculum, their background and prior experience in higher\neducation is comparable to EG students. CG2 students\u2019 curriculum aims at introducing\nstudents into the theoretical frameworks of Social Welfare Studies and consists of general\npedagogical courses, specialised courses on Social Welfare Studies, and methodology\ncourses. The didactical approach of these courses is comparable to the curriculum of EG\nand CG1 students: a dominance of theoretical lectures is alternated with group work, which\nfocuses on writing a theoretical paper with a small group of students. During the research\nperiod, students from both control groups attended regular curriculum activities as part of\ntheir academic training. They were not involved in tutoring, neither in any comparable\n\n1 Although all 64 RPT students participated in the pretest, not all of them attended the posttest assessment.\nAdditionally, the tape recordings of some RPT students demonstrated technical problems. Therefore, the\ndata of 13 EG students were excluded from the analysis.\n\n123\n\n\fIntervention\n\nRPT assignments\n\nTraining\n\nHigh Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486\n\n473\n\ncollaborative learning approach, encompassing systematic conceptual\ndiscussions among students in a face-to-face setting.\n\ninteraction and\n\nEG students were randomly assigned to eleven RPT groups. The RPT programme was a\nformal component of the 5-credit course \u2018\u2018Instructional Sciences\u2019\u2019 (of which the theoretical\nlectures were part of both EG and CG1 students\u2019 curriculum). Informed consent was\nobtained from all participants in the study.\n\nThe RPT intervention consisted of eight successive face-to-face sessions (each taking 2 h),\nin which students tutored each other in small and stable groups of six. The tutor role was\nchanged at each session. As a manipulation check, all RPT groups were observed weekly,\nto control whether students enacted their roles adequately.\n\nDuring each session, students worked on authentic, open-ended group assignments (De\nBacker et al. 2012). Each assignment comprised of an outline of learning objectives to\nguide peers\u2019 discussions to central course-related topics; a subtask aimed at getting familiar\nwith the theme-specific terminology; and a subtask in which students applied theoretical\nnotions to realistic instructional cases.\n\nAll EG students participated in a compulsory tutor training 1 week before the onset of the\nRPT intervention, focussing on tutor responsibilities and generic tutoring skills (i.e.\nestablishing a safe learning climate, managing peer interactions, questioning, explaining,\nscaffolding, and providing feedback) (Chi et al. 2001; King 1997). The training used\nvideotaped examples of good and bad practices, which were discussed in depth, role plays\nin which students experienced multiple tutor responsibilities and received feedback on\ntheir tutoring approach, and the in-depth analysis of authentic case studies focusing on\nspecific tutor competences. The outlines of the training were presented in a manual pro-\nvided to all EG students.\n\nTutor guide\n\nInterim support\n\nTo prepare themselves for the tutor role, tutoring students received a session-specific \u2018\u2018tutor\nguide\u2019\u2019 1 week in advance. This offered additional information about the theoretical\nlearning content to focus upon in the RPT session and assured a difference in tutors\u2019 and\ntutees\u2019 domain-specific knowledge (Topping 1996). Although the theoretical content of the\nguide differed across sessions, its structure and design were identical throughout the RPT\nintervention. In addition to offering theoretical knowledge, the guide exemplified a step-\nwise problem-solving approach (De Backer et al. 2012).\n\nAn interim supervision session and two-weekly feedback sessions were organised, to\nprovide tutor support (Falchikov 2001). The supervision was set up in small groups of\n\n123\n\n\f474\n\nHigh Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486\n\ntwelve students and directed by a university staff member, who encouraged students to\nreflect on the adequacy of their tutor/tutee behaviour. Additionally, the staff member\nprovided group-specific feedback once every 2 weeks.\n\nInstruments\n\nTask\n\nAssessment of students\u2019 metacognitive regulation was based on think-aloud protocol\nanalysis. At the start and the end of the research, all participants individually performed an\nacademic task that was videotaped. Participants were instructed to solve the task and to\nverbalise their problem-solving, resulting in verbal protocols (Greene et al. 2011).\n\nThe individual think-aloud task comprised of a theoretical text and a real-life case relevant\nto the course \u2018\u2018Instructional Sciences\u2019\u2019 (i.e. topic \u2018\u2018evaluation\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018social inequity in\neducation\u2019\u2019 at pretest and posttest, respectively). Students solved thought-provoking\nquestions about the text. In case students stopped verbalising during task performance, they\nwere prompted by the assessor to continue thinking aloud. Apart from a difference in the\ncentral topic, all aspects of the think-aloud task and the assessment procedure were\nidentical at pretest and posttest. Both tasks provided a challenging yet comprehensible text,\ncomprised of multiple parts, and had to be executed during the mild time constraint of\n30 min (Greene et al. 2011).\n\nCoding instrument\n\nTo analyse students\u2019 verbal protocols, we developed a literature-based coding instrument,\nrepresenting a multi-layered model of metacognitive regulation (De Backer et al. 2012).\nOrientation, planning, monitoring, and evaluation are adopted as the main coding cate-\ngories and further specified with sub-coding categories (i.e. task analysis, content orien-\ntation, planning in advance, interim planning, comprehension monitoring, monitoring of\nprogress, evaluation of learning outcomes, and evaluation of the learning process).\nAdditionally, a dimension on the low-/deep-level approach is included.\n\nCoding strategy\n\nThe verbal protocols of all students were transcribed verbatim and coded by two inde-\npendent and trained coders. They double coded 25 % of the protocols to determine\ninterrater reliability. Cohen\u2019s kappa (j = 0.78) indicates high overall interrater reliability\nand good agreement beyond chance for the four main coding categories (jorientation = 0.89,\njplanning = 0.86, jmonitoring = 0.82, and jevaluation = 0.89). The coding procedure followed\nsubsequent phases and focused exclusively on students\u2019 verbalised behaviour. Each verbal\nprotocol was initially segmented according to changes in the verbalisation focus, which\nformed the boundaries of substantial \u2018\u2018episodes\u2019\u2019 (Chi et al. 2001). An episode is con-\nceptualised as a brief segment of the overall verbal protocol that was centred around one\nparticular action. After segmentation, each episode received a general code, indicating\nwhether it concerned a metacognitive, task-executive, or off-task episode. Second, meta-\ncognitive episodes were selected for more detailed \u2018\u2018statement coding\u2019\u2019 (Roscoe and Chi\n2008). A statement refers to a single thematically consistent verbalisation of a single\n\n123\n\n\fHigh Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486\n\n475\n\nmetacognitive action. Next, the identified metacognitive statements were coded by means\nof the developed coding instrument. Every statement received a general code (indicating\nthe regulation skill it addressed) and a more differentiated code (referring to the concre-\ntised regulation strategies situated in the subcategories of the coding instrument). Addi-\ntionally, the approach (low level /deep level) to the identified metacognitive statements\nwas coded. Table 1 exemplifies the coding strategy.\n\nData analysis\n\nFirst, the frequency of occurrence of all regulation skills and strategies, and of low-/deep-\nlevel approaches, was calculated for each protocol per participant. The frequency of\noccurrence of regulation skills and approaches in individual students\u2019 protocols was\naggregated for each research condition. These frequencies per condition were used for\nanalysis purposes. Second, pre-analysis investigations were conducted to check both the\nassumption of normally distributed data (i.e. by means of Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov tests) and\nthe assumption of homogeneity of variance (i.e. by means of Levene\u2019s tests). Since the\nresults revealed that neither assumption was violated, parametric analyses (i.e. t tests) were\nperformed to examine the significance of differences in the adoption of metacognitive\nregulation between conditions and measurement occasions. Third, independent samples\nt tests were conducted (i.e. comparing EG with CG1, EG with CG2, and CG1 with CG2,\nrespectively) to assure that the metacognitive regulation of students in the three conditions\nwas comparable at pretest. Fourth, the frequency of occurrence of regulation skills and\napproaches at pretest and posttest was compared by means of paired samples t tests, to\nstudy the impact of RPT on students\u2019 use of metacognitive skills (hypothesis 1) and on\ntheir deep-level regulation approach (hypothesis 2). Significant differences in students\u2019\nmetacognitive regulation at pretest and posttest were tested for each condition separately\n(see Tables 3, 4, 5). Cohen\u2019s d is reported as a measure of effect size of significant\ndifferences which were identified in students\u2019 adoption of regulation skills and a deep-level\nregulation approach. The significance level was 0.05 for all analyses.\n\nResults\n\nDescriptive analysis on students\u2019 metacognitive regulation\n\nTable 2 demonstrates a dominant involvement of all students in metacognitive monitoring,\nboth at pretest and posttest, whereas their adoption of orientation, planning, and evaluation is\nrather limited, especially at pretest. Results moreover reveal a clear pretest-to-posttest change\ntowards more frequent use for the majority of metacognitive strategies by EG students. For\nsome metacognitive behaviour, this trend is markedly smaller in both control groups (e.g.\ncomprehension monitoring, evaluation of learning outcomes), while for other metacognitive\nstrategies this positive evolution cannot be discerned at all (e.g. orientation, monitoring of\nprogress). In contrast, the planning behaviour of students appears to evolve similarly for all\nresearch groups. Results further reveal students\u2019 limited attention to evaluation of the\nlearning process, deep-level monitoring of progress, deep-level planning, and taking into\naccount task perceptions. This is observed at pretest and posttest, in all conditions.2\n\n2 Metacognitive regulation strategies with very low frequency of occurrence (\\1 % in Table 2) were\nremoved from further analyses.\n\n123\n\n\f476\n\nHigh Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486\n\nTable 1 Exemplified coding strategy\n\nVerbal protocol excerpt\n\nStatement coding\n\nApproach\n\nEpisode\ncoding\n\nIt is about assessment and evaluation\n\nMetacognition Exploring task demands\n\nLow\n\nI first read the instructions to know what I have\n\nMetacognition Exploring task demands\n\nLow\n\n(orientation)\n\n(orientation)\n\n(orientation)\n\nMetacognition Processing task demands\n\nDeep\n\nto do.

Additionally, EG students demonstrate a significantly enhanced\ninvolvement in deep-level regulation at posttest. The reported effect sizes for these evo-\nlutions are moreover large (see Table 3). No significant changes could be identified in none\nof the above-mentioned regulation skills, neither in a deep-level regulation approach, for\nCG1 students (see Table 4) or CG2 students (see Table 5).

pretest and at posttest\n\ninformation and by elaborating on the learning content. Although CG1 students and CG2\nstudents also increase significantly in more comprehension monitoring through para-\nphrasing at posttest (see Tables 4, 5, respectively), the pretest-to-posttest change is sig-\nnificantly larger for EG students. Regarding students\u2019 deep-level regulation approach, the\nresults reveal a major pretest-to-posttest change for deep-level comprehension monitoring\nfor EG students (see Table 3). EG students are, moreover, nearly equally involved in low-\nlevel and deep-level comprehension monitoring, whereas control students predominantly\nengage in low-level comprehension monitoring (see Table 2). CG1 students\u2019 and CG2\nstudents\u2019 adoption of deep-level comprehension monitoring does not change significantly\nfrom pretest to posttest (see Tables 4, 5, respectively).\n\nFurther, EG students significantly increase the frequency of monitoring their progress\nfrom pretest to posttest (see Table 3). Remarkably, a significant negative pretest-to-posttest\nchange was revealed for both CG1 students (see Table 4) and CG2 students (see Table 5).\nAlthough Table 3 additionally demonstrates a significant pretest-to-posttest increase in\ndeep-level monitoring of progress for EG students, their involvement in this respect\n\n123\n\n\f480\n\nHigh Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486\n\nTable 4 Results of pre- and posttest think-aloud protocol analysis in CG1 condition: Occurrence of\nmetacognitive regulation skills and low-level versus deep-level regulation\n\nMetacognitive skill\n\nFrequency\n\nt(df)\n\np\n\nCohen\u2019s\nd\n\nOrientation\n\nTask analysis\n\nExploring task demands (LL)\n\nProcessing task demands (DL)\n\nContent orientation\n\nActivating prior knowledge (DL)\n\nPlanning\n\nMonitoring\n\nComprehension monitoring\n\nNoting lack of comprehension\n\nSummarising main ideas\n\nDemonstrating comprehension by\n\nrepeating (LL)\n\nelaborating (DL)\n\nMonitoring of progress\n\nChecking progress (LL)\n\nReflecting on progress (DL)\n\nEvaluation\n\nEvaluating learning outcomes\n\nChecking outcomes (LL)\n\nElaborating on outcomes (DL)\n\nPretest\n\nPosttest\n\nM\n\nSD M\n\nSD\n\n1.17\n\n1.08\n\n0.92\n\n0.17\n\n0.08\n\n0.08\n\n2.17\n\n7.96\n\n3.50\n\n1.75\n\n0.00\n\n1.17\n\n4.54\n\n4.50\n\n0.04\n\n0.37\n\n0.37\n\n0.37\n\n0.00\n\n1.09\n\n1.00\n\n0.58\n\n0.13\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n1.34\n\n2.71\n\n1.79\n\n1.11\n\n0.00\n\n1.00\n\n1.69\n\n1.69\n\n0.03\n\n0.13\n\n0.13\n\n0.13\n\n0.00\n\n1.58\n\n1.58\n\n1.46\n\n0.12\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\n2.50\n\n7.50\n\n5.12\n\n1.08\n\n0.67\n\n2.71\n\n2.33\n\n2.33\n\n0.00\n\n0.58\n\n0.58\n\n0.58\n\n0.00\n\n1.17 -1.22 (23)\n\n1.17 -1.52 (23)\n\n0.83 -2.60 (23)\n\n0.09\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\n0.25(23)\n\n1.45 (23)\n\n1.45 (23)\n\n0.88 -1.09 (23)\n\n1.69\n\n1.06 (23)\n\n1.72 -3.43 (23)\n\n0.233\n\n0.143\n\n0.061\n\n0.802\n\n0.162\n\n0.162\n\n0.286\n\n0.302\n\n0.002\n\n0.87\n0.071\n2.56 (23)\n0.15 -4.29 (23) \\.001\n1.62 -4.21 (23) \\.001\n\n1.40\n\n1.40\n\n0.00\n\n6.20 (23) \\.001\n6.11 (23) \\.001\n\n1.00 (23)\n\n0.13 -1.00 (23)\n\n0.13\n\n1.00 (23)\n\n0.13 -1.00 (23)\n\n0.00\n\n\u2013\n\n0.328\n\n0.328\n\n0.328\n\n0.328\n\n\u2013\n\n0.36\n\n0.45\n\n0.76\n\n0.40\n\n0.59\n\n0.59\n\n0.30\n\n0.21\n\n0.87\n\n0.43\n\n1.75\n\n1.17\n\n1.45\n\n1.39\n\n0.40\n\n0.32\n\n0.32\n\n0.16\n\n\u2013\n\nDemonstrating comprehension by\n\n0.50\n\n0.22\n\n0.67\n\n0.16 -0.59 (23)\n\n0.558\n\n0.18\n\nremains low (2.6 %).

Table 3 further reveals a significant\nincrease in EG students\u2019 adoption of both low-level and deep-level orientation. However,\nEG students\u2019 engagement in deep-level orientation remains limited (3.5 %). No significant\npretest-to-posttest changes could be found for CG1 students\u2019 and CG2 students\u2019 deep-level\norientation (see Tables 4, 5, respectively).\n\nDiscussion\n\nImpact of RPT on students\u2019 adoption of metacognitive regulation\n\nThe results indicated that students are predominantly involved in monitoring their prob-\nlem-solving when executing an academic task, both at pretest and at posttest, in all\nresearch conditions. The findings further revealed an increased adoption of monitoring and\nto a lesser extent evaluation and orientation by EG students at posttest. Except for low-\nlevel comprehension monitoring, the above-mentioned pretest-to-posttest increases were\nnot discerned in the control conditions. These results consequently demonstrated that RPT\n\n123\n\n\f482\n\nHigh Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486\n\nis more beneficiary for fostering students\u2019 adoption of monitoring and (albeit to a lesser\nextent) evaluation and orientation, compared to traditional teaching approaches. A sig-\nnificant impact on students\u2019 planning behaviour could, however, not be distinguished, not\nfor EG students neither for the control conditions. This might be due to the design of the\nthink-aloud task, for the latter partially determines the outcomes of protocol analysis\n(Greene et al. 2011). Since students were expected to solve three thought-provoking\nquestions on a well-structured academic task, the opportunities to plan were probably\nscarce. Additionally, students might not have felt the need to sequence problem-solving\nsteps within the available time framework. It should further be noted that the developed\ncoding instrument might not have been sensitive enough to capture students\u2019 planning\nappropriately. Future research should aim to conceptualise metacognitive planning in a\nmore specific way in order to optimise its assessment.\n\nRPT appeared to have a critical impact on students\u2019 application of comprehension\nmonitoring. During RPT, students were challenged to approach the learning content crit-\nically and to negotiate its meaning, resulting in self-questioning (Roscoe and Chi 2008). It\nseems plausible to assume that a semester-long experience in this cognitively challenging\nRPT environment prompted students to internalise this comprehension monitoring\nbehaviour. It should be noted, however, that control students also checked their under-\nstanding more often at posttest. Consequently, students\u2019 increased involvement in com-\nprehension monitoring might be partially attributed to their experienced need for self-\nregulation in higher education (Nota et al. 2004). During their first semester at university,\nall students were presumably faced with the demands for elaborative thinking and self-\ncontrol of one\u2019s understanding, resulting in the adoption of monitoring strategies. Nev-\nertheless, our findings demonstrated that EG students showed a significant larger adoption\nof monitoring strategies as compared to students in control conditions, implying an added\nvalue of RPT.\n\nOur findings further revealed increased monitoring of progress and more evaluative\ncomments on learning outcomes for EG students. In contrast, both control groups did\nincrease their metacognitive reflection and evaluation, not during the course of\nnot\nproblem-solving (i.e. monitoring their progress), neither upon completing it\n(i.e.\nmetacognitive evaluation). These findings suggest that RPT is a promising approach\nwhen aiming to advance students\u2019 evaluative reflections. It can be assumed that the key\nelements of PT (i.e. asking and answering thought-provoking questions, providing\nknowledge-building explanations, scaffolding, giving feedback.) directly fostered stu-\ndents\u2019 self-reflections and evaluative insights (Chi et al. 2001; Roscoe and Chi 2008).\nAdditionally, the design of the RPT learning materials might have promoted students\u2019\nevaluative engagements, for the assignments and weekly tutor guides systematically\noutlined learning objectives, which might have served as an evaluative tool (Zimmer-\nman and Schunk 2011).\n\nGiven EG students\u2019 increased adoption of certain metacognitive regulation strategies,\nwe recommend higher education instructors to implement RPT when aiming to promote\nuniversity students\u2019 metacognitive regulation. The results more specifically revealed that\ntraining students to tutor each other stimulates them to start monitoring their learning more\nfrequently. Additionally, the present study suggests that well-structured and goal-oriented\ngroup assignments have potential to elicit particular evaluation strategies (albeit less\npronounced compared to evoking monitoring acts). Consequently, organising RPT requires\neducators to carefully design learning materials which can encourage students in regulating\ntheir learning.\n\n123\n\n\fHigh Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486\n\n483\n\nImpact of RPT on students\u2019 deep-level regulation approach\n\nNotwithstanding students\u2019 dominant use of low-level regulation, at pretest and posttest, our\nfindings revealed significant effects of RPT on students\u2019 deep-level metacognitive regu-\nlation. Given that none of the control groups demonstrated significant pretest-to-posttest\nchanges towards a deep-level regulation approach for none of the key regulation skills, the\nabove-mentioned result\nimplies that RPT is more beneficiary to enhance students\u2019\nengagement in deep-level regulation, compared to traditional teaching approaches. Our\nfindings more specifically demonstrated that EG students outperformed control students in\nthe adoption of deep-level comprehension monitoring. Since tutors were trained to promote\ntutees\u2019 profound reflective thinking by asking critical questions, providing cognitive\nscaffolds, and giving knowledge-building explanations, it could be assumed that RPT\nparticipants observed and eventually internalised these strategies, modelled by their tutors.\nEG students additionally revealed an increased use of deep-level task analysis, profound\nmonitoring of progress, and deep-level evaluation of learning outcomes. It should be noted,\nhowever,\nthe frequency of occurrence of these deep-level regulation strategies\nremained low. Students\u2019 rather limited involvement in deep-level regulation might be\nexplained by both the need for explicit metacognitive prompts and more extensive\nopportunities to practise regulation skills (Schunk and Zimmerman 2007). Since orienta-\ntion and evaluation can only be employed before and upon completion of task execution,\nrespectively, their frequency of occurrence might have been too limited for students to\nevolve towards frequent deep-level orientation and evaluation.\n\nthat\n\nBased on our results, we advise higher education instructors to implement long-lasting\nRPT interventions, allowing students the time they need to evolve towards more frequent\npractice with different deep-level regulation strategies. This practice could increase the\nchances of students starting to internalise a deep-level approach when regulating their\nlearning. Additionally, it might be advisable to include explicit scaffolds in the RPT\nlearning materials, which can directly prompt students\u2019 deep-level regulation during all\nphases of problem-solving. Such scaffolds might particularly be relevant for evoking\norientation, evaluation, and planning, given that these regulation skills remained rather\nlow-level in the current RPT intervention, which was characterised by open-ended RPT\nassignments, not directing students\u2019 regulation. Prompting students\u2019 deep-level regulation\napproach in future research could enhance their regulative engagement in this respect,\nallowing students to refine and spontaneously adopt a deep-level approach when applying\ndiverse regulation skills.\n\nLimitations and recommendations for future research\n\nSince the present study was conducted in a naturalistic university setting, it was, due to\nethical reasons, preferable not to randomly assign students from the same class group to\neither the experimental or control condition. Although two control groups were involved,\nthese were not completely comparable due to differences in participants\u2019 background or\ntheir university curriculum. Consequently, caution is needed when interpreting the sig-\nnificant changes in students\u2019 metacognitive regulation. Alternative explanations for EG\nstudents\u2019 increased regulation can be found in both students\u2019 cognitive gains and the\nemphasis on self-regulation in the course \u2018\u2018Instructional Sciences\u2019\u2019. Empirical research\ndemonstrated that students\u2019 metacognitive regulation is correlated to their cognitive actions\nand performance (Greene and Azevedo 2009; Zimmerman and Schunk 2011). Students\nwith higher levels of general and domain-specific knowledge are expected to demonstrate a\n\n123\n\n\f484\n\nHigh Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486\n\nlarger involvement in regulation, often resulting in better performance. Moreover, high\nlevels of knowledge and academic experience are assumed to positively influence the\nquality of learners\u2019 metacognitive skills (Chin and Brown 2000). This study was set up in\nrelation to the course \u2018\u2018Instructional Sciences\u2019\u2019 introducing students in theories about\nlearning and instruction, including self-regulation. The particular course context might\nhave enhanced EG students\u2019 problem-solving awareness, resulting in a theory-driven\nexecution of the think-aloud task. It should be noted, however, that metacognitive gains\nbased on students\u2019 knowledge of \u2018\u2018Instructional Sciences\u2019\u2019 could equally be expected from\nCG1 students, since the course was also a formal part of their curriculum. Nevertheless, EG\nstudents\u2019 increased regulation at posttest was not reflected in the regulation behaviour of\nCG1 students.\n\nFurthermore, the assessment of students\u2019 metacognitive regulation was exclusively\nbased on their verbalised problem-solving. It can be assumed, however, that students do\nnot always explicitly articulate their thinking and regulation (Meijer et al. 2006), implying\nthat the identification of metacognitive utterances in the think-aloud protocols might not\nhave been exhaustive. Another limitation of think-aloud protocol analysis concerns the risk\nof reactivity (Greene et al. 2011), since asking students to verbalise can increase their\nattention to their cognitive processing, possibly resulting in more regulation than they\nwould spontaneously demonstrate. Data triangulation through multiple concurrent\nassessment techniques might be more preferable in future research (Meijer et al. 2006).\n\nAlthough the results suggested a positive impact of RPT, we only reported short-term\neffects. Long-lasting interventions are needed to guarantee an enduring impact. Further-\nmore, the time-consuming nature of think-aloud protocol coding only allowed for data\nanalysis on a relatively small sample (Roscoe and Chi 2008). The study was moreover\nconducted in a particular setting, with students studying a specific course. Future research\npreferably involves other student populations, alternative instructional settings, or other\ntutoring formats to increase the representativeness of the findings.\n\nIt should further be noted that although the RPT intervention successfully elicited\nstudents\u2019 metacognitive monitoring, its effects on the adoption of orientation and evalu-\nation, as well as of deep-level metacognitive regulation (i.e. monitoring and orientation)\nwere less prominent. This might be related to the format of the think-aloud tasks and RPT\nassignments (Greene et al. 2011; Perry and Winne 2013). Both might have stimulated\nstudents to particularly check their comprehension and progress but might have been less\nappropriate to evoke (and assess) other regulative acts. Future research with alternative\ntask formats is needed to examine whether more changes can be discerned in students\u2019\nadoption of specific regulation skills and approaches after participation in RPT.\n\nGiven the observation that the impact of RPT might be stimulated by specific collab-\noration patterns within particular tutoring groups (Chi et al. 2001), future process-oriented\ninvestigations could also be promising (Roscoe and Chi 2008). Analysis of videotaped\nthe present findings. Directly observing\nRPT sessions could moreover complement\nlearning and regulation could unravel when, how, and to what extent metacognitive reg-\nulation skills are adopted by RPT participants and consequently help to explain the\npotential metacognitive effectiveness of RPT suggested in the current study.\n\nSince the promotion of metacognitive regulation requires explicit modelling and guided\npractice, increasing student\u2013staff ratio\u2019s challenge university instructors to successfully\n\nConclusion\n\n123\n\n\fHigh Educ (2015) 70:469\u2013486\n\n485\n\nsupport students\u2019 regulation (Topping 1996). The present study demonstrated that organ-\nising RPT could be a valuable alternative. A RPT setting concerns a small-scale learning\nenvironment and consequently allows for intensive metacognitive modelling by peers and\nindividualised feedback on internalised regulation skills. The results of the present study\nmoreover demonstrated that RPT has the potential to foster university students\u2019 meta-\ncognitive regulation, more specifically students\u2019 monitoring. Despite students\u2019 additional\nenhanced evaluation and orientation, RPT was considerably less influential towards these\nregulation skills. The effects regarding students\u2019 adoption of deep-level regulation were\nrather limited as well, given that RPT mainly elicited deep-level comprehension moni-\ntoring. Based on our findings, we recommend the implementation of RPT in higher edu-\ncation in order to promote students\u2019 metacognitive regulation, more specifically their\nadoption of (deep-level) monitoring strategies. Additionally, we advise instructors to\ncarefully train students for RPT and to design appropriate learning materials which can\nelicit regulative acts.\n\nThe present study not only has the potential to inspire educators when aiming to foster\nstudents\u2019 metacognitive regulation, and it also offers empirical insights enhancing our\nunderstanding of students\u2019 adoption of particular regulation skills. Our findings further-\nmore raise questions concerning which elements in the RPT setting specifically evoke\nmetacognitive regulation and therefore present new process-oriented research directions to\nexplore regulation in collaborative groups in depth.\n\nReferences\n\nBrown, A.

Introduction\n\nDuring the last decade, a growing body of empirical studies has been published considering the task and\nrole of facilitators in the context of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) (Bonk, Wisher, &\nLee, 2004; Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2000; Rickard, 2004; Salmon, 2000). The discussion about the role\nof facilitators in CSCL is related to a debate about the critical potential of collaboration in online learning\ncontexts. It has been argued that collaboration does not systematically produce learning (Dillenbourg,\n2002). In this respect, the present CSCL-debate focuses especially on the conditions that foster productive\n\n* Corresponding author.\n\nE-mail address: Marijke.DeSmet@UGent.be (M.

Recent studies discuss for instance the need for guidance and structure (Bonk\net al., 2004; Johnson & Johnson, 1996; Laurillard, 1998), scaffolding (McLoughlin & Marshall, 2000; Mercer\n& Wegerif, 1999; Rickard, 2004), or facilitation (Clouston, 2005) as mutually dependent factors facilitating\nmeaningful online discourse. Based on a number of both theoretical and empirical arguments, it can be argued\nthat tutors can play a beneficial role in this context.\n\nAs to the importance of structured activity in online collaboration, it should be taken into account that\nalthough interactive media are seen as giving much greater freedom of control to the user, this self-control can\nlead to difficulties in organising the input of information, in structuring the discussion, and in developing a per-\nsonal overview, resulting in lower levels of knowledge construction (Schellens & Valcke, 2005). In this respect,\nsome authors point at a critical precondition to consider the learner\u2019s need to discern structure in the messages\n(Laurillard, 1998). Johnson and Johnson (1996) for example underscore that, whether the cooperative setting\nmakes use of technology or not, structuring the activity is essential for academic success. Moreover, Cohen\n(1994) stresses that tutors can play a compensating role in low-level interactions, since the structuring interven-\ntions of tutors can raise the level of the discourse and can ensure that disengaged students get reconnected.\n\nA second and related critical factor to foster productive interactions in collaborative settings is the explicit\nstudent need for assistance. The need for guidance and online support in CSCL settings is comparable to the\nneed of classroom support in face-to-face settings (Lazonder, Wilhelm, & Ootes, 2003). Bonk et al. (2004) state\nthat the guidance and moderating skills of the instructor are vital for online team success. Falchikov (2001)\nrefers to the importance of helping behaviour to empower students to learn and collaborate online. In this\nrespect, scaffolding, which plays a critical role in Vygotsky\u2019s \u2018zone of proximal development\u2019 (Vygotsky,\n1978), can be considered as a central concept. Scaffolding is provided to learners by a more capable expert,\nteacher, or peer helping the learners to perform a task they would normally not be able to accomplish by\nworking independently. It advances the learners\u2019 activity from a current level of understanding to a point\nwhere support is no longer required (McLoughlin & Marshall, 2000). Research of McLoughlin and Marshall\n(2000) points at the legitimate nature of scaffolding offered by peers in computer conferences to support cog-\nnitive development. This is consistent with the statement of Jaramillo (1996), who describes how learners pro-\ngress from zone to zone with the help of the scaffolds they present to one another. Moreover, it appears that\nthe similar role position of peers supporting one another as compared to staff support entails beneficial effects\non motivation (Neville, 1999).\n\nBuilding on the empirical base regarding the importance of structured and guided collaboration, a research\nstudy was set up integrating cross-age peer tutoring into the context of asynchronous discussion groups. Peer\ntutoring can be defined as \u2018people from similar social groupings who are not professional teachers, helping\neach other to learn, and learning themselves by teaching\u2019 (Topping, 1996, p. 322). A more capable, knowledge-\nable, and experienced peer with a supportive role is called the \u2018tutor\u2019, while less experienced students receiving\nhelp from a tutor are called \u2018tutees\u2019 (Topping, 1998). As to the definition of peer tutors, Falchikov (2001)\nargues that peer tutors are often defined by what they are not. They do not have a professional qualification,\nthey do not have a formal evaluation role, and finally, peer tutors have no control over the curriculum or\nmaterials used. Two large categories of peer tutoring can be distinguished. Students can be paired with other\nstudents from within their own class groups. This variant is called same-age peer tutoring. The second variant\nis called cross-age peer tutoring and refers to older and more knowledgeable students tutoring younger\nstudents.\n\n2. Theoretical background\n\nIn the context of the present research, cross-age peer tutors were introduced to provide structure and scaf-\nfolds in order to foster cognitive development in online group discussions. Taken into account the definition of\npeer tutoring (Topping, 1996, 1998), tutors were expected to help less experienced tutees to learn in a collab-\norative context. The principle of co-construction of meaning, which is linked to learning in collaborative set-\ntings, is in line with Vygotsky\u2019s socio-cultural theory, focusing on the assumption that \u2018action is mediated and\ncannot be separated from the milieu in which it is carried out\u2019 (Wertsch, 1991, p. 18). As to the description of\nhow mediation takes place, Vygotsky (1978) proposed the concepts of internalisation and zone of proximal\n\n\fM. De Smet et al. / Computers & Education 50 (2008) 207\u2013223\n\n209\n\ndevelopment. In the present study, the milieu in which peer tutors adopt the role of mediator is characterized\nby student interactions in a CSCL-setting. In this respect, it should be taken into account that the demands of\nbeing an online tutor are somewhat different than those of a face-to-face tutor (Duggleby, 2000; Falchikov,\n2001). Next to the specific needs for online facilitation according to the context in which the facilitation is car-\nried out, the gradual shift of students moving to a next zone of development as a consequence of guided\nexchange and internalisation has been put forward in literature. The idea of mediation pertains to the concept\nof peer tutoring since a cross-age peer tutor may adopt the role of mediator, converting his exchanges into\nlearning opportunities for the tutees. The gradual shift of students moving to a next zone of development\nas a consequence of a guided exchange activity and internalisation has also been put forward in the context\nof online learning. For instance, Salmon (2000) presents a five-step model to direct e-moderating skills that is\ntaxonomical in structure. Hence, the initial e-moderating activities are conditional for future support. The\nmodel aims at guided exchange activity that \u2013 at stage five \u2013 results in self-regulated contributions of students\nin the collaborative environment.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, the consecutive roles and tasks of e-moderators as grounded in the hierarchi-\ncal model are explained in more detail. The model can help to get a better understanding of online peer tutor-\ning behaviour. Nevertheless, transferring the model for e-moderating to a peer tutoring context has raised the\nquestion whether tutor performance is a matter of evolution in contrast with studies reporting that tutors\napply person-specific tutoring styles.\n\n2.1. E-moderating\n\nA review of the literature focusing on support approaches in electronic collaborative learning environments\nresults in a variety of concepts (e.g. e-tutoring, online mentoring, e-coaching, e-moderating) being used to\naddress the roles, tasks, and responsibilities of online facilitators. E-moderating is indicated as a central con-\ncept (Bonk et al., 2004; Fahy & Ally, 2005; Salmon, 2000) commonly associated with computer mediated con-\nferencing (CMC). In this respect, Salmon (2000) connects e-moderating to the need of making the content and\nsocial interactions in CMC meaningful to all participants. A multi-faceted approach to direct e-moderating\n\nFig. 1. Five-step model for e-moderating from Salmon (2000). Retrieved from: http://www.atimod.com/e-tivities/5stage.shtml.\n\n\f210\n\nM. De Smet et al. / Computers & Education 50 (2008) 207\u2013223\n\nskills is presented in a five-step model. In addition, the specific structure of the model is especially helpful in\nview of training student tutors in discussion groups (see Fig. 1).\n\nThe first moderation stage \u2018access and motivation\u2019 centres on welcoming participants and offering them\ntechnical support to get online. In this respect, online e-moderators pay attention to the participants\u2019 readiness\nto learn in a digital environment. When participants feel comfortable with the medium, they start submitting\ncontributions. Getting to know each other, sharing empathy, and having a clear sense of the \u2018discussion group\naudience\u2019 is the priority at the second moderation stage \u2018online socialisation\u2019. At this stage, e-moderators help\nestablishing a feeling of \u2018community\u2019. The e-moderator guarantees that everyone feels respected and heeds\nrespect for the input of others. A pleasant and constructive atmosphere is fundamental for further learning.\nAt the third stage of \u2018information exchange\u2019, learning is becoming the more prominent objective. The role\nof the e-moderator is giving direction by submitting plenty of messages. The moderator\u2019s messages help to\nfocus on the task or problem, shed light on the most relevant topics, and provide supportive content-related\ninformation. Central at the fourth stage \u2018knowledge construction\u2019 are social negotiation and task-related\nengagement. Knowledge construction occurs when participants explore issues, take positions, discuss their\npositions in an argumentative format, and reflect on and re-evaluate their positions. In this respect, e-moder-\nators have the role of a facilitator, not a transmission role. They ask questions, reformulate input, keep an eye\non the structure of the debate, and summarise what has been stated thus far. The overall purpose at this stage\nis sharing meaning and building common understanding. At the fifth and final stage \u2018development\u2019, partici-\npants reassess their own thinking and explore the social learning processes. Key ingredient at this stage of per-\nsonal development is reflection and becoming responsible for one\u2019s own learning. In this respect, e-moderators\nneed to challenge learners\u2019 thoughts, for example by playing the devils\u2019 advocate and by encouraging critical\nthinking. The more participants rethink and reconsider their contributions, the more stage five has been\nreached.\n\n2.2. Peer tutoring: A matter of evolution?\n\nThe taxonomical model of Salmon (2000) is consistent with literature indicating that social and planning\nbehaviour is of central importance to foster knowledge construction and reflective thinking in a CSCL-setting\n(Billett, 1996; Garrison et al., 2000; Schellens & Valcke, 2005). Referring to the model for e-moderating, this\nmeans that although every phase in the model is important, in the long run one should reach the highest\nphases in the negotiation. Notwithstanding the fact that the Salmon model is frequently mentioned in the lit-\nerature, little research has been set up to study the actual adoption of the proposed stages in online discus-\nsions. The development of e-moderation over time neither is examined empirically.\n\nMcLoughlin and Marshall (2000) argue that tutors\u2019 scaffolds are rather dynamic than fixed considering\nthe full complexity of collaborative learning in online discussions. According to Lycke, Stromso, and\nGrottum (2003), computer-supported problem-based learning implies contextual circumstances that may\naffect tutor performance. Further, previous research suggested that development in tutors\u2019 behaviour refers\nto the extent to which tutors\u2019 supportive interventions interact with task, group, and individual student char-\nacteristics (Johnson & Johnson, 1996; Schellens, Van Keer, Valcke, & De Wever, in press; Slavin, 1995). In\nline with these interaction effects on the nature of online facilitation, it could be hypothesized that Salmon\u2019s\ntaxonomical model takes the situation-specificity of tutor performance (Lycke et al., 2003) into account. As\ncan be derived from the model, a distinction can be made between beginning and advancing in the role of\ne-moderator. Moreover, during computer-mediated conferencing, e-moderators are assumed to move along\nthe five stages of e-moderating dependent on contextual variables. With regard to the dynamic characteristics\nof e-moderators, the present study focuses on and explores the nature of peer tutors\u2019 scaffolds over time.\n\n2.3. Peer tutoring: A matter of style?\n\nAs mentioned above, e-moderating can be described as a multidimensional concept, which is assumed to\nbe dynamic dependent on the assignment features and students\u2019 discourse acts and needs. Furthermore,\ne-moderating is supposed to be dependent on individual traits, especially those of the moderator himself\n(Lycke et al., 2003). In this respect, we are interested in whether peer tutors, in the role of e-moderators,\n\n\fM. De Smet et al. / Computers & Education 50 (2008) 207\u2013223\n\n211\n\ndevelop a certain tutor style when facilitating the interaction and learning processes in asynchronous discus-\nsion groups. The work of Hakkarainen and Lipponen (1998) has already reported that tutors apply person-\nspecific tutoring styles. Recently, Pata, Sarapuu, and Lehtinen (2005) supported the notion of person-related\nscaffolding styles in network-based role-play. More specifically, they report a passive and active tutoring\nstyle. The passive tutoring style consisted of less frequent process and content scaffolding acts with the tutor\nnot in the dominating role. In the case of the active tutoring style, the tutor used frequent scaffolding acts\nand led the decision-making process by keeping the initiative. These findings of more or less stable and indi-\nvidual tutoring styles can be compared to what has been studied in the field of \u2018approaches to studying\u2019 (Ent-\nwistle, Tait, & McCune, 2000), \u2018student learning styles\u2019 (Fahy & Ally, 2005; Kolb, 1993), and \u2018approaches to\nteaching\u2019 (Kember, 1997), where certain styles have been identified. Grasha (2002) identified the following\nteaching styles as a description of prevalent aspects of teacher presence in the classroom: expert, formal\nauthority, personal model, facilitator, and delegator. For Pratt (2002) most teachers have only one or\ntwo perspectives as their dominant view of teaching: transmission, developmental, apprenticeship, nurturing,\nand social reform. The different styles have been developed and used in varying educational contexts to\nexplain and accommodate individual differences in the organisation of teaching and learning practices.\n\n3. Research objective\n\nBuilding on the theoretical framework, the aim of the present study was to explore cross-age peer tutor\nbehaviour in asynchronous discussion groups. Taken into account Salmon\u2019s five-step model for e-moderating,\nit may be expected that tutor interventions evolve from \u2013 initially \u2013 introductory and social talk to \u2013 finally \u2013\ncontributions eliciting cognitive processing and critical thinking along consecutive discussion themes. Related\nto our view that the five-step model for e-moderating on the one hand interacts with task and group charac-\nteristics and on the other hand with individual student (incl. tutor) characteristics, there is the idea of tutors\npreferring a certain tutor style, reflected by specific tutor behaviour. This argumentation introduces the pres-\nent research question whether tutor behaviour can be regarded as dynamic and consequently evolving and dif-\nfering over time or rather as tutor-dependent reflecting a tutor\u2019s preferred style.\n\n4. Method\n\n4.1. Setting\n\n4.2. Participants\n\nThe present study was set up in a naturalistic higher education setting at Ghent University in Belgium. The\nonline discussion groups were a formal component of a 5-credit freshman course \u2018Instructional Sciences\u2019,\nwhich is part of the first-year curriculum of students studying Pedagogical Sciences. This introductory course\nis set up in a blended format. Next to the weekly face-to-face sessions, all first-year students (N = 257) had to\nparticipate in asynchronous discussion groups in order to discuss problems and cases building on the theoret-\nical base. In the discussion groups, peer tutors supported the work of the students. Tutors were fourth-year\nEducational Sciences\u2019 students performing the e-moderating activities as a part of their educational and teach-\ning internship (a 6-credit course).\n\nThirty-nine 4th-year student tutors were involved in the study. They worked in 18 pairs and 1 group of\nthree tutors to support asynchronous discussion groups. The majority of the peer tutors (90%) were female,\naged between 22 and 24 years. Both tutors and tutees represented the entire population of fourth- and first-\nyear students enrolled for the first semester of the academic year 2004\u20132005. Nine to 11 freshmen were\nenrolled in each discussion group. Tutor pairs were composed on a voluntary base as opposed to the 257 tutees\nwho were randomly assigned to a discussion group. We opted for co-tutorship in the peer tutoring setting to\nreduce the workload of the internship. However, this did not imply that the two tutors gave support simulta-\nneously. One of both tutors took turns to support the members of their asynchronous discussion group. The\n\n\f212\n\nM. De Smet et al. / Computers & Education 50 (2008) 207\u2013223\n\nnon-active tutor worked in the background, followed closely the interaction, and shared ideas with the co-\ntutor in view of the tutoring activities.\n\n4.3. Procedure\n\n4.3.1. Online tutoring\n\nDuring 12 weeks, peer tutors supported the freshmen in discussing six successive authentic cases and prob-\nlems, related to central themes in the Instructional Sciences course: behaviourism, cognitivism, constructivism,\ninstructional design, and evaluation. In line with the constructivist principles, the discussions were based on\nreal-life situations. Moreover, relevant links to websites and supplementary questions were added to refine\nand structure the task completion. The students were expected to work during two weeks on each discussion\nassignment. After two weeks, the discussion was only accessible on a read-only base and a new discussion\ntheme was presented for each discussion group. As the peer tutors worked in dyads, the tutors alternated\nthe support of the discussion group with their co-tutors. In this respect, three pairs of discussion themes\ncan be distinguished: each tutor moderated a discussion group for the first time during the first or second dis-\ncussion theme, led their group through the third or fourth discussion assignment, and completed their intern-\nship during the fifth or last discussion theme.\n\n4.3.2. Tutor training programme\n\nThere is a widespread agreement in the peer tutoring literature that students must be trained in order to\nbecome a proficient tutor (Duggleby, 2000; Falchikov, 2001; Parr & Townsend, 2002; Van Keer, 2004). Peer\ntutoring activities are less effective without a preceding training programme (King, 1997; Palincsar & Brown,\n1984). In the present study, preliminary training was organised two weeks before the onset of the asynchro-\nnous discussion groups. Guidelines were given collectively in a face-to-face setting during two three hour ses-\nsions. By the end of this training programme, participants received a manual including practical examples and\nreminders. The tutor training programme was grounded in the theoretical models and frameworks for training\ncoaches (Costa & Garmston, 1994; Irwin, Hanton, & Kerwin, 2004), tutors (Lentell, 2003; Moust & Schmidt,\n1998), mentors (Jonson, 2002; Rickard, 2004), and e-moderators (Bonk et al., 2004; Salmon, 2000). In this\nrespect, the five-step model for e-moderating of Salmon (2000) was discussed. Furthermore, tutors were\nencouraged to go through the first year course as well as through transcripts of previous discussion groups\nin which freshmen negotiated course contents without peer tutor assistance. Additionally, responding to con-\ntent mistakes, conflicts, unclear arguments, and tutees\u2019 non-participation in the discussion group was\nexercised.\n\n4.3.3. Focus groups\n\nIn order to foster the peer tutoring activities, focus groups with the fourth-year tutors were organised on a\nregular base. In addition, they were asked to write a personal internship logbook consisting of critical reflec-\ntions and the identification of indicators of personal progress (Seale & Cann, 2000). This requirement for tutor\nreflection is grounded theoretically in the literature concerning professional development of teachers (Rueda &\nMonzo \u0301, 2002).\n\n4.4. Content analysis\n\nContent analysis was applied to analyse the complete dataset of 114 transcripts generated during the asyn-\n\nchronous discussions (19 groups \u00b7 6 discussion themes).\n\n4.4.1. Unit of analysis\n\nThe \u2018unit of meaning\u2019 in a message was chosen as the unit of analysis. Following Chi (1997) a unit of mean-\ning is defined as a unit that represents a consistent idea, argument chain, or discussion topic. Since tutoring is a\nmultidimensional activity and units of meaning were chosen as the unit of analysis, it is clear that the tutor\ncontributions can reflect a variety of tutoring categories within a single message. The identification of the units\nof meaning was carried out by three trained and independent coders. As suggested by Strijbos, Martens, Prins,\n\n\fM. De Smet et al. / Computers & Education 50 (2008) 207\u2013223\n\n213\n\nand Jochems (2006), a procedural distinction was made between the segmentation process into units of anal-\nysis and the content analysis and coding process.\n\n4.4.2. The content analysis coding scheme\n\nTo explore the tutor contributions, a new coding scheme was developed, rooted in the five-step model of\nSalmon (2000). Seventeen categories, representing the five stages, were distinguished as concrete and opera-\ntional indicators of tutoring behaviour. Table 1 represents and exemplifies the coding categories.\n\n4.4.3. Reliability analysis\n\nThree independent coders received a training to carry out the segmentation procedure. A sample of 151\ntutor contributions was segmented in units of meaning by each individual coder. Next, the researchers\ncompared and discussed the segmented units of meaning in order to reach consensus about the segmentation\n\nTable 1\nCoding scheme based on the five-step model for e-moderating (Salmon, 2000)\n\nE-moderating\n\nIndicators of tutor behaviour\n\nExamples\n\nAccess and motivation\n\nElucidating the digital learning environment as\nwell as conceptions about the tutor role\nBeing accessible to computer-related problems\n\nEncouraging participating and wishing good luck\n\nSocialisation\n\nInformal talk\nAppreciating and confirming contributions\n\nShowing commitment\n\nInformation exchange\n\nModelling and illustrating the contents with\nexamples, personal views, and concepts\nBringing in other content information\n\nKnowledge construction\n\nAsking for content explanations and clarification\n\nDevelopment\n\nCall for further reflection\n\nOrganisational arrangements and planning\n\nUnravelling the learning task\nExplaining the learning task\n\nAsking to summarise\n\nGiving feedback about learning and social\nprocesses, giving suggestions to both the\nindividuals and the group\n\nElaboration.

This is a type of\ncommunication that creates doubts during\ncontributing.

In addition to the segmentation training, the coders also received a training to apply the 17 subcat-\negories grounded in Salmon\u2019s five-step model (Salmon, 2000). The three hour training resulted in a high level\nof interrater reliability. The reliability sample consisted of 508 units of meaning or 9% of the full sample and\nwe calculated overall percent agreement (0.91) as well as Krippendorff\u2019s a (0.84). The overall agreement rate\nshows the overall percentage agreement of the three coders across all subcategories. Krippendorff\u2019s a demon-\nstrates the level of agreement beyond chance between the three coders (De Wever, Schellens, Valcke, & Van\nKeer, 2006). Both indices were calculated and reported since there is no general agreement on which should be\nused. Percent agreement is considered an overly liberal index by some researchers, whereas the indices, such as\nKrippendorff a, which do account for chance agreement, are considered overly conservative and restrictive (De\nWever et al., 2006).\n\n5. Results\n\n5.1. Descriptive results\n\nDuring the 12 weeks and 6 consecutive themes, tutors posted 1955 messages. As can be derived from Table 2,\nthe highest number of messages was posted during the second discussion theme. There is a gradual decrease in\nthe average number of tutor contributions. Within the 1955 messages, the coders identified 5472 units of\nmeaning. As presented in Table 3, it is apparent that although triggering reflection is hardly present, peer\ntutors appear to use a variety of tutoring activities as suggested in the preliminary training. A high proportion\nof tutor behaviour focuses on exchanging information. In the vast majority (almost 30%) of the units of mean-\ning within tutors\u2019 contributions, tutors pay attention to planning, separating, and explaining the learning\ntasks, bringing in additional sources, and modelling the discussion. In about 27% of the units of meaning\nin tutor postings, tutors concentrate on the creation of a motivating learning environment. Further, in about\n24% of their contributions they watch over discourse clarity and they structure the discussion in order to facil-\nitate students\u2019 knowledge construction. Peer tutors show a clear social commitment in 18% of their messages.\nFinally, in only 1% of the interventions, tutors stimulate personal development and reflection.\n\n5.2. Can tutor behaviour be regarded as dynamic? Is there an evolution over time?\n\nWith regard to the question whether tutoring evolves over time, we refer to Table 3. The results indicate\nthat \u2018information exchange\u2019 occurs most often within each discussion theme in comparison with the other\ne-moderating stages and this from theme 2 on.

Remarkably, the incidence of contributions focusing on \u2018socialisation\u2019\nincreases over time, while a declining trend can be seen in contributions stimulating knowledge construction.\nIn order to test the changes in the proportions of tutor behaviour throughout the successive discussion themes,\nv2 analysis was applied.\n\nAs can be observed in Table 4, significant changes occur in tutors\u2019 behaviour over the six themes in general,\nand between themes 1 and 2 and between themes 3 and 4 in particular. Looking in more detail at the evolution\nbetween the first and the second discussion theme, a decrease in contributions concerning \u2018access and motiva-\ntion\u2019 is found in favour of an increase of units of meaning encouraging tutees\u2019 knowledge construction. In the\ntransition from themes 3 to 4 on the other hand, an opposite trend can be noticed. In this respect, it can be\nconcluded that there is some evolution in tutoring behaviour over time. However, this development is not con-\nsistent and does not reflect a gradual increase in higher levels of peer tutoring activities as reflected in the Sal-\nmon model.\n\nTo refine the analysis, two broad types of tutor communication within the Salmon model were identified.\nOn the one side, tutors reflect social and emotional communication (SEC), which encompasses all tutoring\ninterventions focusing on \u2018access and motivation\u2019 and \u2018online socialisation\u2019. Secondly, the remaining types\nof e-moderating interventions are combined and labelled as communication about cognitive processing\n(CPC). To verify whether tutor interventions evolve from introductory and social talk to contributions reflect-\ning cognitive processing and critical thinking, a univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied. The\nproportion of SEC-interventions was included as the dependent variable; discussion theme was included as\nthe independent variable. The results reveal a significant upward trend in social and emotional communication\nand thus a significant downward trend as to the level of communication concerning cognitive processing\nthroughout the six discussion themes (F = 3.51; df = 5; p < 0.01). However, posthoc analyses (Sheffe\u2019s crite-\nrion), only reveal a single significant difference between the second and the last discussion theme\n(p = 0.022). These results question the idea of a gradual shift in the nature of tutoring behaviour and imply\nthat each new discussion theme appears to require a mixture of different tutoring interventions.\n\n5.3. Can tutor behaviour be regarded as tutor-dependent? Is it possible to distinguish different tutoring styles?\n\nThis question focuses on exploring tutoring styles on the basis of tutor behaviour during the subsequent\ndiscussions. To examine tutor profiles, cluster analysis was carried out. The purpose of cluster analysis is\nto derive a classification scheme for grouping a number of individuals or objects into clusters, so that individ-\nuals or objects within a cluster are more similar to each other than those from other clusters (Aldenderfer &\nBlashfield, 1984; Gore, 2000). The purpose of the analysis is thus to arrange objects into relatively homoge-\nneous groups based on multivariate similarity (Gore, 2000). Since no a priori assumptions regarding the num-\nber of relevant clusters could be derived from the literature, an exploratory hierarchical cluster analysis was\ncarried out. Hierarchical cluster methods proceed by stages producing a sequence of partitions each corre-\nsponding to a different number of clusters. They can be either \u2018agglomerative\u2019, meaning that groups are grad-\nually merged until one large cluster is formed, or \u2018divisive\u2019, starting with all cases in one cluster, which is\npartitioned into smaller clusters at each stage. Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis techniques, as used\nin SPSS, start with each case representing a separate cluster. Cases close to one another, as assessed by their\ncorrelational Euclidean distance, or other similarity measures are joined, forming progressively more inclusive\ngroups or clusters. This process is repeated until all cases form a superordinate cluster. A decision must then\n\nTable 4\nResults of the v2-analyses with regard to the evolution of the occurrence of contributions in the five categories (Salmon, 2000) as indicator\nof tutor behaviour over time\n\nEvolution in tutor behaviour over time\n\nEvolution from theme 1 to theme 6\nEvolution from theme 1 to theme 2\nEvolution from theme 2 to theme 3\nEvolution from theme 3 to theme 4\nEvolution from theme 4 to theme 5\nEvolution from theme 5 to theme 6\n\nv2\n\n38.47\n15.01\n5.30\n17.77\n6.12\n5.13\n\ndf\n\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\np\n\n0.000\n0.005\n0.258\n0.001\n0.191\n0.274\n\n\f216\n\nM.

In the\npresent study, the Ward hierarchical method was adopted, which implies that within-cluster differences are\nminimized (Hair, Anderson, Tatham, & Black, 1998). The squared Euclidean distance was used as a similarity\nmeasure. To determine the optimal number of clusters, the agglomeration schedule coefficients were examined.\nFor a good cluster solution, one should look at a sudden jump in the distance coefficient or a sudden drop in\nthe similarity coefficient between two adjacent sets. In addition to reviewing the changes in clustering coeffi-\ncients at each step, the number of clusters was also verified by visual inspection of the dendograms and of the\nindividual and group profiles within and across clusters. The hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on 6\nclassification measures, reflecting tutors\u2019 process of moderating the asynchronous discussion groups. More\nspecifically, the following variables were included in the analyses: the proportions of tutors\u2019 contributions\nin the different stages of e-moderating distinguished by Salmon (2000) (i.e. access and motivation, online soci-\nalisation, information exchange, knowledge construction, and development) and tutors\u2019 presence throughout\nthe different discussion themes, as reflected in the total number of messages posted during the discussions. The\ndata were not standardised prior to using the squared distance measure, since the scale measurements were\ncomparable for all classification measures.\n\nAs to the results of the analysis, the agglomeration schedule indicates a large increase in the distance coef-\nficients when moving from a three cluster to a two cluster solution. Therefore, a three cluster solution was\nchosen and consequently three tutoring profiles were distinguished, consisting of respectively 28.2%, 38.5%,\nand 33.3% of the tutors. Table 5 presents the mean scores and standard deviations of the six classification mea-\nsures of each cluster. The profiles, labelled as \u2018motivators\u2019, \u2018informers\u2019 and \u2018knowledge constructors\u2019, are dis-\nplayed in Fig. 2. Except for the rather rare occurrence of tutor contributions stimulating freshmen\u2019s personal\ndevelopment in all clusters, the clearly different course of the three profiles indicates that tutors\u2019 behaviour\ndiffers both in quantity and in quality of the contributions.\n\nThe first tutor profile (N = 11) is primarily characterized by a low level of presence in the ongoing discussions\nand a high proportion of contributions with regard to gaining access and stimulating freshmen to participate in\n\nTable 5\nMeans and standard deviations of the classification measures per cluster (Hierarchical clustering)\n\nClassification measure\n\nCluster 1\n\u2018Motivators\u2019 (N = 11)\n\nCluster 2\n\u2018Informers\u2019 (N = 15)\n\nAccess and motivation\nSocialisation\nInformation exchange\nKnowledge construction\nDevelopment\n\nPresence\n\n32.47 (4.80)\n21.51 (4.30)\n23.81 (5.56)\n20.11 (5.38)\n2.09 (3.46)\n\n12.00 (3.14)\n\n26.90 (4.14)\n17.16 (4.24)\n33.43 (4.71)\n21.46 (2.93)\n1.05 (1.25)\n\n19.72 (3.39)\n\nCluster 3\n\u2018Knowledge Constructors\u2019\n(N = 13)\n\n22.64 (6.31)\n18.76 (6.51)\n27.02 (4.83)\n30.19 (4.91)\n1.39 (1.37)\n\n18.86 (6.22)\n\n40\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n\n5\n0\n\nAccess &\nmotivation\n\nSocialisation\n\nInformation\nexchange\n\nKnowledge\nconstruction\n\nDevelopment\n\nPresence\n\nCluster 1: M otivators (N=11)\n\nCluster 2: Informers (N=15)\n\nCluster 3: Knowledge constructors (N=13)\n\nFig. 2.

Further, tutors in this cluster show average proportions of online social-\nisation contributions, whereas postings reflecting information exchange and knowledge construction occur less\nfrequently than in the other clusters. The second cluster (N = 15) shows a quite different pattern and is char-\nacterized by a high proportion of exchanging information tutoring behaviour on the one hand and a low pro-\nportion of online socialisation messages. This implies that these tutors attach great importance to illustrating\nthe content with examples and their personal point of view, add alternative sources to the discussion, plan the\ndiscussion activities, and unravel and explain the learning task. The main focus of the third cluster of tutors\n(N = 13) is on eliciting knowledge construction. Further, these tutors demonstrate average proportions of con-\ntributions with regard to gaining access and stimulating participation and with regard to information exchange.\nA rather low engagement in contributions reflecting appreciation, confirmation, and commitment is shown.\n\nMultivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test the differences in tutoring types statistically.\nThe tutor profiles were entered as independent variables to compare the five Salmon tutoring interventions\nand the degree of tutor presence in each cluster. Based on the Wilks\u2019 lambda criterion, the multivariate test\nshows a significant cluster effect (F(10, 64) = 8.454; p < 0.001; og2 = 0.569). The corresponding ANOVA\u2019s also\nreveal significant effects on the proportions of tutors\u2019 contributions with regard to access to the learning envi-\nronment and motivation (F(2, 36) = 10.942; p < 0.001; og2 = 0.378), information exchange (F(2, 36) = 12.712;\np < 0.001; og2 = 0.414), knowledge construction (F(2, 36) = 19.615; p < 0.001; og2 = 0.521), and tutors\u2019 pres-\nence throughout the discussion themes (F(2, 36) = 10.656; p = 0.001; og2 = 0.372). No significant differences\nbetween the three clusters were found when considering tutor contributions about online socialisation\n(F(2, 36) = 2.303; p = 0.114; og2 = 0.113) and development, (F(2, 36) = 0.765; p = 0.473; og2 = 0.041). The\nog2 indicates that the clusters explain respectively 38%, 41%, 52%, and 37% of the occurrence of tutors\u2019 con-\ntributions with regard to access to the learning environment and motivation, information exchange, knowl-\nedge construction, and 37% of tutors\u2019 presence throughout the discussion themes. Significant posthoc\nanalyses (Scheffe criterion) associated with the effect of the variable cluster are summarised in Table 6.\n\nAs recommended by Borgen and Barnett (as cited in Gore, 2000) and Gore (2000) the hierarchical cluster\nanalysis, which can be regarded as a data exploration tool, was supplemented with a k-means partitioning\nmethod to confirm the previously established cluster solutions. The k-means clustering was performed with\nthe same variables as in the hierarchical clustering (the proportions of tutors\u2019 contributions in the five stages\nof e-moderating and tutors\u2019 presence throughout the different discussion themes). The results showed three\nparallel tutor profiles, consisting of respectively 33.3% \u2018motivators\u2019, 53.8% \u2018informers\u2019, and 12.8% of \u2018knowl-\nedge constructors\u2019. Table 7 presents the mean scores of the six classification measures of each profile as dis-\ntinguished by k-means clustering. In both clustering methods most tutors fit into the second profile, which is\nmainly characterized by information exchange. The three cluster distribution for the two distinct methods of\nclustering is outlined in Table 8. For only 10 out of 39 online peer tutors, dissimilarity in the cluster allocation\nwas observed between the hierarchical and k-means clustering.\n\nIn order to check whether the three distinguished tutoring styles are stable in time and thus mainly tutor-\ndependent, k-means clustering was performed on the three pairs of discussion themes. In this respect, the sta-\nbility of the clusters throughout the tutorship is tested from the start (themes 1 and 2), over the intermediate\n(themes 3 and 4), to the closing discussion themes (themes 5 and 6).

Looking in more detail to the clustering centers and to the\nevolution within a cluster over time, it appears that in the last themes the \u2018motivators\u2019 show a predominant\nincrease in socialisation (mean = 36.23) next to their constant high proportion of contributions with regard\nto gaining access and stimulating freshmen to participate in the asynchronous discussion. As to the \u2018inform-\ners\u2019, the tutor contributions remain mainly characterized by information exchange. However, in themes 3 and\n4 they additionally show a high proportion of interventions in the fourth stage of e-moderating, namely elic-\niting knowledge construction (mean = 30.63). Finally, whereas tutors belonging to cluster 3 primarily focus on\nknowledge construction, they also fluctuate in the sense of having considerably more contributions aiming at\nthe lowest stages of e-moderating beginning from the third theme.\n\nFinally, to deal with the question whether tutor behaviour is tutor-dependent reflecting a tutor\u2019s preferred\nstyle, we controlled the cluster allocation at the start, intermediate and closing discussion themes for each indi-\nvidual tutor. In this respect it appears that 30% of the tutors do shift from cluster in all discussion themes.\nSixty-five percent of the tutors keeps the same typology two times, while only 5% of the tutors reflect the same\npreferred style during the starting, the intermediate, and closing phase of their tutorship.\n\n6. Discussion\n\nThe present study aimed at gaining insight into the tutoring behaviour of cross-age peer tutors in asynchro-\nnous discussion groups. Training was set up to allow peer tutors to adopt a rich mixture of tutoring behaviour\nthat aims at shared knowledge construction and reflective behaviour in tutees. From the descriptive results it\ncan be argued that cross-age peer tutors perform a blend of tutoring activities, with a slight predominance of\ngiving additional information, clarifying the learning task, and planning activities.\n\nWith regard to the evolution in peer tutor behaviour, it can be concluded that the nature of the overall\ntutoring behaviour is not completely stable over time. The results more specifically point at peer tutoring\nas a dynamic process in which task specificity plays a role. This is consistent with findings from the literature\non problem-based learning (Moust & Schmidt, 1998). The significant decrease in \u2018access and motivation\u2019\ntutoring behaviour from theme 1 to theme 2 can be explained by the students getting acquainted with the\nCSCL learning environment. In the light of Salmon\u2019s taxonomical model, it was expected that from the third\ntheme on more peer tutoring activities would be directed towards \u2018knowledge construction\u2019. However, a sig-\nnificant decrease in this type of tutoring behaviour was observed when comparing discussion themes 3 and 4.\nThis can probably be attributed to the nature of the fourth discussion theme. In this theme, all knowledge\nfrom the previous three themes had to be considered when solving the task. This discussion assignment\nwas extensive and complex for the freshmen, necessitating the peer tutors to invest again in tutoring activities\nsuch as \u2018access and motivation\u2019 and \u2018information exchange\u2019. This is in line with the findings of Solomon and\nCrowe (2001) who also observed how peer tutors convey a permanent sense of worry and a feeling of respon-\nsibility for ensuring that their colleagues addressed the objectives adequately.\n\nFurther, it was explored whether peer tutor contributions would evolve over time from introductory and\nsocial talk (SEC) to contributions reflecting cognitive processing and critical thinking (CPC). Univariate anal-\nysis of variance however rejected this prediction. This finding suggests that each new discussion theme requires\na mixture of all types of peer tutor support as distinguished in the e-moderating model of Salmon (2000). The\ncontinuous importance of motivating and social interventions also confirms the lowest phases in the hierar-\nchical structure of the model. In addition, the finding can be linked to the studies of others on non-peer tutor\nsupport (Billett, 1996; Garrison et al., 2000) who state that social and emotional presence are of continuous\nimportance to foster cognitive processing. Next to these empirical and theoretical explanations for the initial\ne-moderating activities being conditional for future support, arguments can be added building on the nature of\nthe asynchronous learning environment. First, tutors and tutees do not see and know each other while inter-\nacting. As a consequence building a feeling of community is a prerequisite in the text-based learning environ-\nment. Hammond (2000) therefore highlights that a communicative approach within online forums always\nremains both task-centred and personal. Second, it can be hypothesized that social and emotional communi-\ncation is attractive tutor behaviour to start with during the first experience of helping peers. This can be\nconnected to an opportunistic point of view in which some tutors primarily prefer to focus on socialisation\n\n\f220\n\nM. De Smet et al. / Computers & Education 50 (2008) 207\u2013223\n\nwhen intervening on the one hand and to peer tutors\u2019 difficulty to diagnose low levels of knowledge construc-\ntion within the discourse on the other hand. As a result, they tend to agree with the contents of the discussion\nand thus praise when contributing. \u2018Students being too friendly to one another\u2019 has been mentioned by other\nauthors to be a problem in e-learning settings (Bonk et al., 2004). These authors suggest providing online facil-\nitators with reflection schemas or question guides in order to encourage tutor and tutee reflection. Thirdly, the\ndiscussion task might have been too complex and extensive to be able to deal with during the two negotiation\nweeks. The period might have been too brief for peer tutors to be able to go beyond a focus on communication\nto a more cognitive oriented focus. Additionally, since each discussion theme was based on a new body of\nknowledge, little transfer in contributions aiming at knowledge construction from a former discussion theme\ncould occur (Schellens & Valcke, 2005).\n\nIn addition to the study of the evolution in peer tutor behaviour, the purpose of the present study was to\nexplore whether different types of cross-age peer tutors can be distinguished in order to confirm the construct\nof personal tutoring style. Three distinct clusters emerged from the analysis showing quantitative and quali-\ntative differences in the types of e-moderating as distinguished by Salmon (2000) and their presence during the\ndiscussions. In addition, comparable clusters were found along the successive discussion themes. The slight\nvariability in cluster appearance over the different discussion themes as presented in Table 9 is an interesting\nfinding since this confirms the notion of relatively consistent instead of completely consistent tutoring styles\nover time. Notwithstanding the small variation in the characteristics of the tutor styles throughout the discus-\nsion themes, it appears that for the majority of the peer tutors tutor behaviour can be regarded as tutor-depen-\ndent: 70% of the peer tutors holds on to their cluster in at least two phases of the tutorship. This finding\nconfirms earlier research recognizing learning and teaching styles as individual, consistent, and measurable\n(Fahy & Ally, 2005; Grasha, 2002; Kolb, 1993; Pratt, 2002). As to the specification of each tutoring style,\nin the first cluster or \u2018motivators\u2019 profile we could observe few messages and low frequencies of knowledge\nconstruction oriented tutoring behaviour. This is in line with research of Pata et al. (2005) distinguishing a\npassive scaffolding cluster in which process and content scaffolding was performed less frequently than in\nthe active scaffolding cluster. The low presence and high proportion of contributions with regard to \u2018access\nand motivation\u2019 might be related to the quality and/or the duration of the training provided to the peer tutors.\nThis training might have been too restricted to stimulate a subgroup of peer tutors to go beyond a certain type\nof tutoring behaviour. Moreover, we could use information obtained from the cluster solution to optimise\ntutor training. For example, the pros and cons of all three tutor profiles as well as their expected influence\non students\u2019 discourse acts could be outlined in more detail. As suggested by Gore (2000), it is advisable to\nconsider the cluster study as a first step and not as an end in itself.\n\nIn summary, the present study affiliates with the idea of Lycke et al. (2003) that contextual circumstances\nmay be reflected in tutor performance. However, the rather prominent differences in tutor activity do not seem\noverly contextual, but fairly appear to be the result of a person-related tutoring style. Nevertheless, more\nresearch is needed to replicate these results and to study the peer tutor typology in more detail. In this respect,\nadditional attention should be paid to indicators of peer tutors\u2019 preferred style in online interaction, such as\ntheir role perceptions during activity and their efficacy beliefs.\n\n7. Limitations, implications and directions for future research\n\nThe present study reflects a number of limitations. First, the study has been conducted in a particular set-\nting with a medium-size group of peer tutors, studying a specific freshman course in only one university set-\nting. Future research should try to replicate the findings involving other student populations, and set up in\nalternative instructional settings or knowledge domains. Follow-up research could also focus on the question\nwhether the peer tutor activities found in this study would be different for non-peer tutors.\n\nThe present research is also limited since solely quantitative approaches have been adopted in the research\ndesign. Content analysis has been used in order to gain insight in tutor\u2019s behaviour to support students\u2019 nego-\ntiation of subject-matter in asynchronous discussion groups. In order to increase the validity of interpreting\nthe dynamics of online tutor action, triangulation of research methods is needed. Network analysis could,\nfor instance, focus on the structure of the interaction that is (or is not) induced by the peer tutors. Tutors\nmight be interviewed to study their perceptions about being/becoming a coach (Cossentino, 2004).\n\n\fM. De Smet et al. / Computers & Education 50 (2008) 207\u2013223\n\n221\n\nA third comment centres on the need for replication studies that focus on the validation of the content anal-\nysis instrument used in the present study (De Wever et al., 2006). A new content analysis instrument was devel-\noped for this study, based on the five-step e-moderating model of Salmon (2000). To our knowledge, no\nalternative analysis scheme is currently available to study the tutoring interventions in parallel. Future studies\ncould aim at studying the concurrent validity of the applied instrument, and moreover, all subcategories could\nbe explored separately to figure out their distinct appearance and evolution within and along the successive\ndiscussion themes.\n\nFourth, a shortcoming of the cluster analysis technique has to do with the fact that the selection of classi-\nfication measures is critical for the results. Although there is no clear-cut rule of thumb determining the vari-\nables to include in a cluster analysis, Gore (2000) argues that studies guided by theory will have an advantage\nin specifying which variables are most likely to contribute to a meaningful cluster solution. The present study\nis built on Salmon\u2019s stages of e-moderating (Salmon, 2000). More specifically, the proportion of tutors\u2019 con-\ntributions in the different stages, and tutors\u2019 presence throughout the different discussion themes were included\nin the analysis. To validate the applied coding scheme based on the work of Salmon (2000) and the identified\nclusters, additional research employing alternative coding schemes is however necessary. Another critical issue\nin cluster analysis is how many clusters should be extracted. Since there is no generally accepted statistical cri-\nterion for this, the choice must primarily be based on the meaningfulness of the clusters. However, based on\nthe agglomeration schedule coefficients and visual inspection of the dendograms, three well-defined tutor pro-\nfiles could be discriminated.\n\nParallel to a number of methodological limitations, suggestions can be made that inspire follow-up\nresearch. Peer tutors differ in behaviour and shift their supportive activities due to a mix of task, group,\nand individual student variables that we did not figure out in more detail (e.g. task complexity, discussion time\nper theme, degree of group cohesion, freshmen\u2019s level of prior knowledge, tutoring style, tutor\u2019s efficacy or role\nbeliefs, etc.). With respect to individual tutor characteristics, it is also important to realise that although the\npeer tutors involved in the study are all fourth-year students, they do not represent a homogenous group. The\nfollowing individual characteristics could be considered: gender, age, experience in working with groups, and\nICT knowledge and skills. Accordingly, design characteristics such as the constellation of intervening alone\nwhile working in pairs and the preliminary training could have influenced the observed diversity in tutor\nbehaviour. In this respect, future research should investigate the distinct as well as mixed effects of contextual\ncircumstances on tutor performance in more detail since results are always better understood in the light of the\nbackground and setting in which they take place. Moreover, similar studies with larger sample sizes and a\nwider range of higher education tutors can help to better understand the impact of these inter-individual dif-\nferences on peer tutor behaviour (Irwin et al., 2004).\n\nThe present study is to be considered as a pilot study. At present, the tutor typology should be regarded as\nexploratory and descriptive rather than as an explanatory typology that is grounded in a peer tutoring theory.\nMore research is needed to confirm whether the number and the tutoring types are stable and are also to be\nfound in other groups of peer tutors and other tutoring settings. According to Aldenderfer and Blashfield\n(1984), this cross-validation is important to verify whether the cluster solution found has a certain degree\nof generality. If the cluster structure in the present study is stable, similar clusters should re-emerge in the anal-\nysis of other samples.\n\nFurther, it will be interesting to examine the relationship between tutoring behaviour, the peer tutor typol-\nogy and the nature, and the quality of the tutees\u2019 contributions in asynchronous discussion groups. These new\nstudies could finally also focus on impact on the quality of the knowledge constructed in the discussion groups\nand the resulting performance on tests, tasks, or evaluation activities.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nAlthough the findings of this study provide mixed evidence for the contextual influences of tutor behaviour,\nit is clear that they cannot provide robust support for the expected evolution in time when analysing tutors\u2019\ntranscripts. According to the results, tutors\u2019 interventions differ throughout consecutive discussion themes, but\nthey do not significantly evolve from introductory and social talk to contributions eliciting cognitive process-\ning and critical thinking. Whereas there is no apparent tendency in the orientation of tutors\u2019 contributions, the\n\n\f222\n\nM. De Smet et al. / Computers & Education 50 (2008) 207\u2013223\n\nresults further reveal peer tutor behaviour as being tutor-dependent reflecting a tutor\u2019s preferred style. As a\nresult of cluster analysis methods, the following tutor profiles were distinguished inspired by Salmon\n(2000): \u2018motivators\u2019, \u2018informers\u2019, and \u2018knowledge constructors\u2019. Apart from future research on larger sample\nsizes and contextual influences on tutor performance, additional studies should also focus on exploring those\nthree peer tutor styles according to more specific research questions.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nReferences\n\nThis study was funded in part by the Flemish Government under the BOF programme, NR. 1107104.\n\nAldenderfer, M.

The current study used a simultaneous treatments design to \nanalyze the comparative effects of whole-word vocabulary instruction and morphograph instruction on students\u2019 vocabulary \nacquisition and generalization through the use of a computer-assisted peer-tutoring program. Seven of eight middle school \nparticipants with mild disabilities involved in this study acquired higher percentages of vocabulary in the morphograph con-\ndition compared to the whole-word condition. All eight students were better able to generalize to unknown vocabulary in \nthe morphograph condition. This study\u2019s findings indicate a functional relationship between morphograph instruction and the \nacquisition and generalization of vocabulary.\n\nKeywords\nmorphograph, vocabulary, peer tutoring, computer-assisted instruction\n\nVocabulary knowledge greatly contributes to text compre-\nhension and overall reading achievement (Medo & Ryder, \n1993; Nagy, 1988; Stahl, 2003). Students who have limited \nvocabulary  knowledge  often  struggle  with  content-area \nreading comprehension (Bryant, Ugel, Thompson, & Hamff, \n1999). Research has shown that the rate at which students \nacquire vocabulary varies tremendously; students with read-\ning disabilities tend to have poor vocabularies because of \ntheir limited involvement with reading activities, and the \nvocabulary  gap  between  good  readers  and  poor  readers \nincreasingly widens over time (Bryant et al., 1999). Therefore, \nit is critical that struggling readers receive instruction spe-\ncifically targeted for vocabulary.\n\nTeachers often use a variety of strategies to increase stu-\ndents\u2019 vocabulary knowledge (e.g., definition, context, pre-\nreading, incidental exposure, keyword method), but there has \nbeen insufficient empirical support to suggest any one strat-\negy as superior to others in promoting vocabulary growth \n(National Reading Panel, 2000). The National Reading Panel \n(2000) suggested that strategies for teaching vocabulary vary \nwidely and stressed a great need for research in vocabulary \ninstruction.\n\nThe National Institute for Literacy (2003) recognized that \nknowledge of some common prefixes and suffixes (affixes), \nbase words, and roots can help students learn the meaning of \nmany new words. A morpheme is the most elemental spoken \nunit that has meaning. Teaching vocabulary through the study \nof words parts or morphemes is one approach that has some \nempirical and authoritative support for enhancing regular \nvocabulary instruction (Carlisle, 2000; Wysocki & Jenkins, \n1987). Their counterparts in writing are referred to as morpho-\ngraphs. All words are composed of one or more morphograph \n(Dixon, 1991). Morphological knowledge supports the process \nof learning to decode written words and facilitates both word \nreading and understanding of words and texts (Carlisle, 2003).\nA number of authorities have posited that morphologi-\ncal knowledge plays a role in students\u2019 word reading and \n\n1University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC\n\nCorresponding Author:\nCharles L.

Moats (2000) contended \nthat knowledge of word meaning, rapid word recognition, \nand spelling ability greatly depend on knowledge of word \nstructure at the level of morphemes. In spite of authoritative \nsupport spanning more than two decades for teaching mor-\nphemes or morphographs, there has been little empirical \nsupport for the possible benefits of morphograph instruc-\ntion for learners with or without disabilities (Dixon, 1991).\nWysocki  and  Jenkins  (1987)  investigated  the  extent \nto which morphological generalization could account for \nincreases  in  vocabulary  size.  The  study  tested  students\u2019 \nability to use morphological and contextual information to \ndetermine the meaning of unknown words. Results showed \nthat students were able to make use of knowledge of word \nstructure to infer the meaning of the unknown words. In a \nsimilar study, Carlisle (2000) analyzed the effects of mor-\nphological awareness on word reading and reading compre-\nhension  with  a  group  of  third  and  fifth  graders.  Results \nshowed that awareness of structure and meanings of derived \nwords were significantly related to the ability to define mor-\nphologically complex words. Despite these promising results, \nmore research needs to address the potential benefits of mor-\nphograph instruction on vocabulary acquisition and gener-\nalization compared to traditional approaches to vocabulary \ninstruction (e.g., whole word).\n\nIn addition to considerations regarding the strategy for \nteaching new vocabulary, the National Reading Panel (2000) \nsuggested that decisions regarding task presentation (e.g., \nlearning strategies, context, computer technology) need to be \nmade. Explicit instruction of roots and affixes could be done \nthrough presentation and creation of oral and written exam-\nples in context (Moats, 2000). Carnine, Silbert, Kame\u2019enui, \nand Tarver (2004) recommended directly teaching the most \ncommonly used morphemes (e.g., co, pre, able). According \nto an analysis by Moats (2000), if students receive direct \ninstruction in the meanings of the most commonly used pre-\nfixes, identification of base words when common suffixes \nare removed, and the spelling changes associated with the \naddition of inflections beginning with vowels, they can suc-\ncessfully analyze 250 new printed words per year through \nmorphological analysis.\n\nOne efficient learning strategy that increases task engage-\nment and the number of opportunities for practice is recip-\nrocal  peer  tutoring  (Heron, Villareal, Yao,  Christianson, \n& Heron, 2006; Maheady, Mallette, & Harper, 2006). Peer \ntutoring is an evidence-based strategy that increases active \nstudent engagement and provides multiple opportunities to \npractice academic content with immediate delivery of cor-\nrective feedback (Heron et al., 2006; Maheady et al., 2006). \nOne limitation of peer tutoring is that the tutor needs to have \navailable the correct response to provide accurate feedback. \nThis can be difficult when working with a population with \n\nlimited  reading  skills.  One  solution  is  to  make  correct \nresponses available through audio feedback (Van Norman \n& Wood, 2008). This changes the role of the tutor to con-\ncurrent learner, provider of social reinforcers, and audience, \nwhich  may  help  the  learner  to  attempt  responses  before \nusing audio feedback.\n\nUsing computers for this purpose is efficient and advan-\ntageous. Computer-assisted instruction is an individualized \napproach that can reach students at all levels (Kolich, 1991). \nSome studies suggest that computer-assisted vocabulary \ninstruction  shows  positive  learning  gains  over  traditional \nmethods (Davidson, Elcock, & Noyes, 1996; Heise, Papelewis, \n& Tanner, 1991; Heller, Sturner, Funk, & Feezor, 1993; \nReinking & Rickman, 1990). The purpose of this study was \nto add morphograph instruction to current and recommended \npractices for teaching vocabulary and to determine its effects \non  the acquisition  and generalization of  vocabulary. The \nresearch questions for this study were as follows:\n\n1.  To what extent does teaching the meaning of mor-\nphographs result in higher acquisition of vocabu-\nlary than when students are taught word meaning \nwithout attention to morphographs?\n\n2.  To what extent does teaching the meaning of mor-\nphographs result in greater acquisition of novel \nwords with those morphographs than when students \nare taught without attention to morphographs?\n3.  Which method of instruction do students prefer?\n\nMethod\nParticipants and Setting\n\nThe students were 8 seventh grade students (5 boys, 3 girls) \nranging in age from 12 to 15 years. Students who were \nidentified as having a disability under the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Improvement Act (2004) were spe-\ncifically chosen for this study. Of the participants, 4 were \nidentified as having an other health impairment, 1 par-\nticipant  had  an  emotional  or  behavioral  disorder,  and  3 \nparticipants had a specific learning disability. Of the par-\nticipants, 2 were African American, 5 were Caucasian, and \n1  was  Hispanic.  The  students  were  included  in  general \neducation classrooms and received small-group instruction \nin language arts and math in the special education resource \nroom. According to their most recent individualized edu-\ncation programs (IEPs), all participants were functioning \nat least one level or more below grade level in reading. \nEach student also had an IEP goal that addressed increas-\ning his or her vocabulary acquisition as well as improving \ncomprehension of unknown vocabulary in the context of \nprinted material. Table 1 summarizes students\u2019 demographic \ninformation.\n\n\fWood et al. \n\n41\n\nTable 1.

The school \nincluded many students who came from families with low \nsocioeconomic status, and more than 65% of the students \nreceived  free  or  reduced-price  lunch. All  sessions  of  the \nstudy  were  delivered  in  the  school\u2019s  resource  room.  The \nresource classroom was an 18 ft \u00d7 20 ft room that contained \ndesks, instructional materials, a desktop personal computer, \nand a laptop computer. A video camera was used to record \ntutoring sessions and probes. For the tutoring sessions, only \none pair of students was in the resource classroom at a time. \nFor the pretests and probes, all eight students were in the \nresource classroom at one time.\n\nMeasures\n\nPretests. The experimenter (second author) created 48-item \npretests  given  at  the  beginning  of  the  study  and  following \nevery  two  tutoring  sessions. An  item  contained  a  sentence \nwith a blank for which a vocabulary word would be selected to \ncomplete the sentence. Each sentence was composed so there \nwas sufficient context to predict the missing vocabulary word, \nif familiar to the student. In addition, each item contained the \ncorrect vocabulary word and three distractors, all with mor-\nphographs, that would be a focus of the next two sessions. The \nexperimenter mixed the position of the correct vocabulary \nselection across items. Of the 48 pretest items, 8 contained less \ncomplex sentence structures and easier, nontargeted vocabu-\nlary words that included the same morphographs. These items \nwere  interspersed  within  the  pretest  to  decrease  frustration \nlevel and ensure some success for the students. After assessing \nthe pretest scores for each student, the experimenter discarded \na maximum of 2 words per morphograph (8 total from the \n40 words) that were known by the majority of the students to \nensure that words already known by the students would not be \nused for instruction or generalization. The remaining 8 words \nper morphograph (32 total) were used in the subsequent set \nof two tutorial sessions and and in the probe.\n\nProbes.  Probes  tested  both  vocabulary  acquisition  and \nvocabulary generalization and had the same format as the \npretests (i.e., multiple-choice sentences, each with four pos-\nsible answers). As explained previously, each probe used the \n32 words composed of four morphographs from the pretest. \nWith an equal distribution of words across the four mor-\nphographs, each morphograph was represented on the probe \nwith 2 taught words and 6 generalization words. In addition \nto items representing the 32 words, nontargeted vocabulary \nwords and sentences were interspersed within the probe, \nbringing the total to 40. The students could attain a total of \n4 correct responses for each condition (8 total) on the taught \nwords and 12 correct responses for each condition (24 total) \non the generalization words. The nontargeted items were not \nincluded in scores.\n\nDependent variables. Two dependent variables were mea-\nsured in this study: acquisition of vocabulary and general-\nization of vocabulary. Acquisition of vocabulary was defined \nas the number of directly taught words, in each condition, \nthat were correctly selected as answers on a multiple choice \nprobe. Generalization of vocabulary was defined as the per-\ncentage of novel words, in each condition, that included a \nmorphograph common to the directly taught words. A max-\nimum of two known words per morphograph could be dis-\ncarded for each participant after the pretest. Based on pretest \nresults, some students correctly selected more than two items \nper morphograph, causing the number of items possible for \nacquisition and generalization to change on a participant-by-\nparticipant basis for the probe. Therefore, the optimal num-\nber of words learned varied by participant when determining \ncumulative totals. When measuring generalization, percent-\nages were used to account for the variability in possible words. \nItem-by-item recording was used to measure the number of \ncorrect responses of both learned and generalized words on \nprobes given after every two sessions. Answers were scored \nas correct if the participant circled the answer choice or wrote \nthe letter of the answer choice that appropriately fit the fill-\nin-the-blank sentence. If the wrong answer choice was cir-\ncled or recorded, the item was counted as incorrect.\n\nInterscorer  reliability.  Because  the  probes  were  written \nproducts, copies of all unscored probes were made so the \nsecondary data collector could independently score answers \nas correct and incorrect. A second scorer used an answer key \nto  evaluate  the  accuracy  of  students\u2019  responses  on  probes. \nInterscorer reliability was measured by comparing the exper-\nimenter\u2019s scores and the secondary rater\u2019s scores on an item-\nby-item basis. Answers that were incorrect  were marked \nwith an X, and answers that were correct were marked with \na C. Interscorer reliability was calculated by counting the \nnumber of agreements, dividing by the number of agree-\nments plus disagreements, and multiplying by 100. Inter-\nscorer  reliability  was  measured  for  30%  of  the  probes; \nagreement was 100%.\n\n\f42 \n\n \n\nRemedial and Special Education 33(1)\n\nSocial validity. Social validity data were collected to measure \nthe outcome of the study from the students\u2019 perspectives. \nSocial validity questionnaires concerning the usefulness of \nwhole-word instruction and/or morphograph instruction \nwere used at the end of the study.\n\nExperimental Design\n\nThe  experimental  design  was  a  simultaneous  treatments \ndesign (Tawney & Gast, 1984) to analyze the comparative \neffects of whole-word vocabulary instruction and morpho-\ngraphic instruction on students\u2019 vocabulary acquisition and \ngeneralization. Because the focus of the study was on the \nacquisition of new vocabulary through the generalization of \nmorphographs, those data were graphed to allow for visual \ncomparison of the effects of two conditions\u2014teaching of \nwhole words and teaching of words with explicit instruction \nof the morphograph and word. Visual analysis of the graphed \ndata was used to compare treatments. The basic feature of \nthis design is the fast alternation of two different interven-\ntions or treatment conditions with an individual learner or \ngroup of learners. Specifically, the interventions in this type \nof design are alternated and counterbalanced within sessions, \nmeaning that students are exposed to both morphograph and \nwhole-word conditions within one session. In a simultaneous \ntreatments design, a functional relationship becomes compel-\nling when there is clear separation between the data paths \nrepresenting measures of the two dependent variables.\n\nThe data for the acquisition of vocabulary are presented \nin a cumulative graph. Because the number of directly taught \nwords was limited to four per condition per probe, a cumula-\ntive graph allows for a visual comparison of trajectories, not \nevident in a session-by-session representation.\n\nProcedures\n\nGeneral procedures. The experimenter created PowerPoint \nslides that contained each session\u2019s content (e.g., instruc-\ntions, words, example sentences, clickable icons for audio \nrecordings of the sentences). Figures 1 and 2 show example \nslides used for peer tutoring for the whole-word and mor-\nphograph conditions, respectively.\n\nThe  study  lasted  14  weeks  and  included  tutor  training \nsessions, tutoring sessions, and pretest and probe sessions. \nTutoring  sessions  took  place  2  days  per  week  and  lasted \napproximately  7  min  for  each  pair.  Following  the  experi-\nmenter\u2019s  direction  to  begin,  the  pairs  began  tutoring. \nAlthough  each  session  was  recorded  via  videotape,  the \nexperimenter closely monitored each pair to ensure proper \nprocedures  were  followed.  After  every  two  peer  tutoring \nsessions,  a  probe  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  extent  to \nwhich students had learned the vocabulary words and gen-\neralization (untaught) vocabulary words. Prior to the start \n\nFigure 1. Example slides for computer-assisted peer tutoring \nduring the whole-word condition\n\nof the next set of tutoring sessions, another pretest was used \nto select unknown words for the next two sessions.\n\nThe majority of words used in this study came from lists in \nworkbooks by Draze (2005a, 2005b) and Vurnakes (1998). \nThe word lists were organized by prefixes, suffixes, and \nword roots. Of the approximately 400 words used in this \nstudy, one fourth of these words were directly taught in the \ntutorial program, with the remaining words used as gener-\nalization words during probes. The words were assigned to \ntutoring pairs so that two pairs of students learned half of the \nwords through morphograph instruction whereas the other \ntwo pairs of students learned those words with only whole-\nword instruction. The reverse took place for the other half \nof the words.\n\nTutor training. The experimenter trained all students on \nthe steps of reciprocal peer tutoring (tutoring and feedback) \nduring three 15-min training sessions prior to data collec-\ntion. All students received step-by-step instructions for the \nrole of tutor and tutee. Specifically, the students were taught \nappropriate tutoring behaviors (e.g., speaking clearly) as \n\n\fWood et al. \n\n43\n\nProbing. After every second tutoring session, a probe was \nconducted on all 8 words that the students learned (as both \ntutor and tutee) as well as the 24 generalization words. The \nprocedures  used  in  pretesting  students  were  repeated  for \neach probe. Of the probes, 40% were recorded for reliabil-\nity measures. All probes lasted approximately 30 min.\n\nConditions\n\nThe tutoring program was set up so that each student acted as \ntutor and tutee for a total of four words each session. For each \npair, one student in the pair was selected to consistently start \nthe session in the tutor role. In every session, two words with \nprefixes and two words with roots were introduced. One \nprefix and one word root were assigned to each condition, \nrepresenting four morphographs in all. The condition iden-\ntified to start the session alternated each session and within \neach session the two conditions alternated as well. For exam-\nple, one tutoring pair began a session with the first word part \nbeing taught using the whole-word condition and the second \nword being taught using the morphograph condition. The \nfollowing session, the tutoring program would begin with \nthe morphograph condition followed by the whole-word \ncondition.\n\nWhole-word condition. The whole-word condition intro-\nduced an unknown vocabulary word, asked the student to \npredict the meaning based on the context of a sentence, and \nthen provided the correct definition for the student to repeat. \nFigure 1 shows example slides for computer-assisted peer \ntutoring during the whole-word condition.\n\nMorphograph  condition.  The  morphograph  condition \nintroduced the meaning of the morphograph and asked the \nstudent to repeat the morphograph and its meaning. The \nstudent was then given a word containing that same mor-\nphograph and was asked to use knowledge of the morpho-\ngraph (word part) and the context to predict the meaning of \nthe word in a sentence. The correct definition was then pro-\nvided  for  the  student  to  repeat.  Figure  2  shows  example \nslides for computer-assisted peer tutoring during the mor-\nphograph condition.\n\nProcedural reliability. A second observer used a checklist \nof the procedural steps to obtain reliability. Procedural reli-\nability was calculated as the percentage of steps completed \ncorrectly across 30% of the sessions. The mean procedural \nreliability across sessions was 95%.\n\nResults\nAcquisition of Vocabulary\n\nThe cumulative number of words acquired for each partici-\npant is shown in Figures 3 and 4. For seven of the eight stu-\ndents, the acquisition data path was steeper for words learned \n\nFigure 2. Example slides for computer-assisted peer tutoring \nduring the morphograph condition\n\nwell as how to give ample thinking time, praise, or correc-\ntive feedback (e.g., \u201cTry again\u201d) to tutees. Students received \ndirections on following a script format (blue script for tutor, \nred script for tutee) in the PowerPoint slides. Tutors were \ntaught to click icons to activate audio recordings of text read \naloud and to advance the slides. Data collection began when \ntutoring pairs demonstrated correct tutoring behaviors and \nmade no procedural errors during the training session.\n\nPretesting. The experimenter met with the four tutoring \npairs in the resource classroom. Prior to beginning the pre-\ntests, the experimenter instructed the students to underline any \nwords or word parts they thought they knew and to circle the \nletter of the best answer choice for each item. The pretest \nitems and answer choices were read aloud by the experi-\nmenter. Items were repeated when requested by the students. \nAll pretest sessions lasted approximately 40 min.\n\n\f44 \n\n \n\nRemedial and Special Education 33(1)\n\nFigure 3.

Cumulative words used correctly on probes for \nAdrienne, Sean, Jacob, and Drew\nNote: Closed triangles indicate number of optimal words for \nmorphograph condition; open triangles indicate number of optimal \nwords for whole-word condition.\n\nin the morphograph condition. The number of optimal words \nstudents could learn varied by their performance on pretests. \nThe number of optimal words for the morphograph condition \nis indicated by a closed triangle and the number of optimal \nwords for the whole-word condition is indicated by an open \ntriangle on each student\u2019s graph. Students had a mean of \n38.5  (range  =  35\u201340)  optimal  words  that  could  have  been \nlearned  for  the  morphograph  condition  and  a  mean  of  37 \n(range = 35\u201340) optimal words that could have been learned \nfor the whole-word condition.\n\nDrew\u2019s cumulative total for words acquired in the mor-\nphograph condition was 29 of 39 optimal words, compared \nto 27 of 36 optimal words in the whole-word condition (see \nFigure 4). When these numbers are used to calculate the \n\nFigure 5. Percentage of generalization words used correctly on \nprobes for Jasmine, Taylor, Alisha, and Wesley\n\npercentage of the optimal number of words that were learned, \nthere is a marginal difference between the two conditions \n(74.3% in the morphograph condition, 75.0% in the whole-\nword condition). The percentage difference between the two \nconditions was greater for the remaining 7  students  and \nfavored the morphograph condition. The difference between \nconditions varies by more than 20 percentage points (range = \n25.4%\u201327.5%, M = 26.9%) in favor of the morphograph \ncondition for Alisha, Adrienne, Sean, and Taylor and greater \nthan 9 percentage points (range = 9.5%\u201313.3%, M = 10.9%) \nin favor of the morphograph condition for Jasmine, Wesley, \nand Jacob. Across students, the mean was 82.9% in the mor-\nphograph condition compared to 65.4% in the whole-word \ncondition.\n\nGeneralization of Vocabulary\n\nFigures 5 and 6 show percentage correct on generalization \nwords given on each probe for each student in both the mor-\nphograph and whole-word conditions. The continuous data \npaths show that percentage correct on generalization words \nwas higher for all eight students during the morphograph \ncondition when compared to the whole-word condition.\n\nData paths for Taylor and Adrienne show no overlapping \ndata points or variable trends. Both students\u2019 scores were \nhigher during the morphograph condition on all 10 probes. \nDespite some overlapping data in Probes 3 and 4, Alisha\u2019s \ndata show higher percentages in the morphograph condition \nfor the remainder of the probes (see Figure 5). Wesley\u2019s data \nindicate a substantial difference in percentage correct between \nthe two conditions from Probe 2 through Probe 10, in favor of \nthe morphograph condition (see Figure 5). Data for Jasmine \nand Sean show a higher percentage correct in the morphograph \n\n\fWood et al. \n\n45\n\ninstruction was added. This study\u2019s findings indicate a func-\ntional relationship between morphograph instruction and \nacquisition and generalization of vocabulary.\n\nBased on social validity data, all students indicated that \nlearning morphographs made it easier to learn new words \nand  to  decipher  the  meanings  of  unknown  words  in  text. \nSeven  out  of  eight  students  indicated  they  would  like  to \nuse the computer for tutoring again. One participant stated, \n\u201cI like how the computer talked to us and gave us the right \nanswer. That  made  it  easier  to  be  the  tutor.\u201d All  students \nenjoyed  the  program  when  they  played  the  role  of  tutor. \nTaylor stated, \u201cI like being the tutor, because it felt like I was \na teacher. It made me feel like I was really helping some-\none.\u201d Only one student indicated that she did not prefer to \nuse the computer for tutoring again and did not offer a spe-\ncific reasoning as to why.\n\nThe findings suggest that teaching vocabulary through \nmorphographs can enhance vocabulary instruction. The results \nsupport the findings by Carlisle (2000) and Wysocki and \nJenkins (1987). Wysocki and Jenkins specifically focused \non  morphological  generalization  with  suffixes  taught  to \nstudents in the fourth, sixth, and eighth grades. This study \nextends that of Wysocki and Jenkins by using different mor-\nphographs (i.e., word roots and prefixes). This study also \ndiffers from both Carlisle and Wysocki and Jenkins in that \nthe population used in this study was seventh grade students \nwith mild disabilities.\n\nOne limitation of this study is that with only four words \nin each condition there is a relatively low ceiling on how \nmuch difference can be seen between the conditions in each \nsession. Another limitation is that the long tests used for pre-\ntesting may have resulted in lower scores because of greater \nfatigue  and  frustration  than  with  probes.  In  an  attempt  to \ndecrease  the  likelihood  of  this  occurrence,  uncomplicated \nitems with easier vocabulary were randomly distributed in \nthe  pretests  and  probes  so  that  students  could  experience \nsome level of success. Finally, we created all of the probes \nused in the study; therefore, the technical adequacy of these \nmeasures is unknown.\n\nThis study has several practical implications for teaching. \nResults indicate that adding morphograph instruction to more \ntraditional whole-word instruction might increase students\u2019 \nacquisition and generalization of vocabulary more than tra-\nditional whole-word instruction alone. Teachers could utilize \nmorphograph instruction as a valuable tool in their class-\nrooms to increase vocabulary acquisition and generalization. \nBased on the results of this study, teachers should also con-\nsider using computer-assisted peer tutoring to supplement \nteacher-led instruction. As indicated in this study, reciprocal \npeer tutoring is especially useful for low-performing students \nor students with disabilities. With embedded audio prompts \n(e.g., Van Norman & Wood, 2008; Wood, Mackiewicz, Van \nNorman, & Cooke, 2007), the PowerPoint format ensures \n\nFigure 6.

Jacob and Drew\u2019s graphs \nshow higher percentage correct on generalization words in \nthe morphograph condition on 9 out of 10 probes.\n\nSocial Validity\n\nAll students indicated that learning morphographs made it \neasier for them to learn the meaning of unknown words than \nwhen  they  did  not  know  the  morphographs.  One  student \nstated, \u201cI enjoyed it very much. I think other students can learn \nmore from this program.\u201d All students stated they enjoyed the \nprogram when they played the role of tutor. Six out of eight \nstudents enjoyed the program when they played the role of \nlearner. Seven out of eight students indicated they would like \nto use the computer for tutoring again in the future.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare morphograph \ninstruction versus whole-word instruction during computer-\nassisted peer tutoring. Seven out of eight students acquired \nmore total vocabulary words and a higher percentage of \nvocabulary  in  the  morphograph  condition.  One  student \nacquired  a  higher  percentage  of  vocabulary  in  the  whole-\nword condition; however, the difference was minimal (i.e., \n75.0% vs. 74.3%). This student also had one of the highest \nreading levels prior to the study and the most developed \nvocabulary when compared to other students on the pretest \nscores. Results suggest that teaching the meaning of mor-\nphographs that make up target vocabulary words increases \nacquisition of those words and the generalization of mor-\nphograph  meaning  to  novel  words  increases  learning  of \nthose words as well because all eight students were better able \nto generalize to unknown vocabulary when morphograph \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nRemedial and Special Education 33(1)\n\nthat low-performing students can act as tutor and still be \nable to provide accurate feedback to the learner.\n\nDepending on the availability of computers in the school \nsetting, a teacher could easily use computer-assisted peer \ntutoring to provide students with extra vocabulary practice. \nTeachers could accommodate the whole class by using a com-\nputer lab. If a classroom computer is available, teachers could \nrotate tutoring pairs on and off the computer during the inde-\npendent work time of a class period.\n\nExtensions of this study could include younger students \nwho are beginning to have reading difficulties so that the \nvocabulary gap can be narrowed at an earlier age. Research-\ners could investigate how morphograph instruction assists in \nthe comprehension of longer reading passages. Future stud-\nies could use a randomized control group design to compare \nmorphograph instruction with other vocabulary instruction \nstrategies. These studies should use measures of vocabulary \nor comprehension that have sufficient validity and reliability.\nThis  study  offers  a  promising  direction  for  teaching \nmorphographs to increase acquisition and generalization of \nvocabulary. At the same time it suggests a number of reasons \nto be optimistic about using computer-assisted peer tutoring \nas a resource in teaching vocabulary. Results of this study \nsuggest that students who lack prerequisite knowledge to \ntutor can be successful when given support through a com-\nputer program. Tutoring with a computer can provide a way \nfor teachers to integrate technology into the classroom and \nallow all students the opportunity to practice appropriate peer \nsocial interactions. Students who might not otherwise have \nthe confidence or willingness to participate in whole-class \ninstruction can benefit from brief but intensive practice.\n\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\n\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interests with respect \nto the authorship and/or publication of this article. \n\nFinancial Disclosure/Funding\n\nThe authors received no financial support for the research and/or \nauthorship of this article. \n\nReferences\n\nBryant, D.

The program used a conditional cash transfer con-\ntract to encourage peer tutors to help their underperforming classmates. Incentivized\npeer-tutoring significantly improved the academic performance of the underperforming\ntutees over a semester. The impact persisted in the second semester when the interven-\ntion was removed. Our results suggest that nongovernment organizations and govern-\nment agencies can increase their capacity of remedying education by incorporating\nincentivized peer-tutoring into their existing merit-based scholarship and conditional\ncash transfer programs.\n\nKeywords: Conditional cash transfer; Peer-tutoring; Remedial education\nJEL classification: O11, I21\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nG overnment and nongovernment agencies are increasingly using condi-\n\ntional cash transfer programs to reduce the negative effects of poverty. In\nthe field of education alone, many such programs have been implemented\naround the globe in the last decade (see a review in Slavin 2009). However, relying\nsolely on cash incentives to remedy education also seems logically unrealistic;\nin this light, a more integrated intervention strategy could be more effective. This\npaper evaluates such a program that encompasses elements from both conditional\ncash transfer and peer-assisted learning.\n\nPeers constitute an important educational resource. Even though peer-tutoring is\ndifferent from formal teaching, their functions are similar. Extensive research in\neducational psychology, which has mainly been conducted in industrialized coun-\ntries, has demonstrated that peer-assisted learning is a very effective teaching\nmethod (Topping 2005). However, hardly any research has been done in develop-\ning countries, where peer resources are arguably more important because other\nresources are in serious shortage and many students do not learn effectively\n(Glewwe and Kremer 2006). Even in the poorest places on earth, a classroom\n\n\u00a9 2012 The Author\nThe Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies\n\ndoi: 10.1111/j.1746-1049.2012.00178.x\n\n\fINCENTIVIZED PEER-TUTORING\n\n335\n\nlacking everything from a blackboard to trained teachers is almost certain to enjoy\nthe presence of some smart students. Making better use of these \u201cwild\u201d human\nresources provides one solution.\n\nMany teachers in China have tried to implement peer-assisted learning in\ntheir classrooms (e.g., Wang 2006; Xie 2008; Zhao 2009). However, it is typically\ndone in an ad hoc and spontaneous fashion. What usually happens is that some\nteachers may request a high-performing student to help another under-performing\nstudent in the same classroom. These teachers are typically neither trained in the\nmethod nor have the time or incentive to provide extra supervision\u2014a problem\nmore serious in underdeveloped rural areas. The tutors and tutees are left to sort\nthings out by themselves, which is obviously not easy. Because of these limita-\ntions, peer-assisted learning remains at a rudimentary level in China.\n\nThe experiences of the industrialized countries suggest that successful peer-\nassisted learning is a very skill-intensive and time-consuming teaching method\n(Topping 2000). Trained teachers need to play a central role. Tutoring protocols\nneed to be carefully designed. Regular tutoring sessions need to be organized\nand supervised by the teachers. These crucial ingredients of the traditional peer-\ntutoring program are typically missing in most Chinese schools.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to test the effectiveness of a peer-tutoring program\nspecifically designed for developing countries. If students respond to economic\nincentives as adults do, a properly designed labor contract for peer tutors may boost\ntheir effort level and improve tutoring efficiency in the absence of extra teacher\ninterventions. This motivated us to add an incentive contract on top of a stream-\nlined peer-tutoring program. Tutors (strong students) in our one-to-one tutoring\nprograms were eligible to compete for a prize in a tournament. Both the chance of\ngetting the prize and its size were conditional on the test score improvement of the\ntutee (weak student) who was paired with the tutor. To simulate the realities in\ndeveloping countries, we required neither structured peer interactions nor teacher\nmonitoring.\n\nTo test our idea, we ran a field experiment in two migrant children primary\nschools in Shanghai, China. Such schools educate millions of poor migrant chil-\ndren (see Section II). With the prize of an official certificate the program showed\nimprovements in the grades of under-performing children by 0.615 standard devia-\ntions over a semester. Adding a monetary reward (labeled a scholarship in our\nprogram) to the prize made the impact larger and more robust. Even though there\nis evidence of heterogeneity in program effects, in most program classes the\nestimated impact was about 0.9 standard deviations over a semester. A large part of\nthe program impact persisted in the second semester when the intervention was\nremoved.\n\nOur program effects are consistent with the findings in the psychology literature\non traditional peer-tutoring programs.

According to Banerjee et al.\n(2007) and Glewwe and Kremer (2006), it is not easy to improve education\nquality with traditional methods. Banerjee et al. (2007) report positive effects\n(0.27 s.d.) of a rare successful program in urban India that hired local young\nwomen (balsakhi) on a flat wage rate to work on basic skills with under-\nperforming children from poor families (see also Mischo and Ludwig [2002] and\nDang and Rogers [2008] for other private paid tutoring in both developed and\ndeveloping countries). They suggest that inputs targeted specifically to helping\nweaker students learn may be effective. Our programs are designed in a similar\nvein; the main difference is that our programs used peer tutors and tournament-\nbased conditional cash transfer. Our program has a larger impact and is more\nflexible to implement in our context.\n\nSections II and III describe the background and design of our programs, respec-\ntively. Section IV describes the design of the evaluation. In section V, we introduce\nthe main program effects for the tutees. Section VI concludes the paper.\n\nII. BACKGROUND\n\nThe majority of migrant children schools is privately owned, and is set up to serve\nthe children of China\u2019s estimated 150 million poor migrant workers. Because they\ncharge migrants much lower fees than local public schools, they are the most\npopular choice for migrants who bring their children to live with them. In Beijing\nalone, about 300,000 to 500,000 migrant children were studying in about 350\nmigrant children schools in 2009. This size is roughly equal to the size of the local\nstudents attending local public schools.1 Across China millions of migrant children\nare attending such schools.\n\nAccording to the results of a large-scale standardized test across China, migrant\nchildren are the weakest link in the Chinese education system (Lai et al. 2012).\nMigrant children are the poorest performing group of students in the entire\ncountry\u2014poorer than children attending local public schools in those underdevel-\noped rural areas. Improving education quality for migrant children has important\n\n1 The number estimations for the migrant children and their schools are based on our extensive\nfield study in Beijing. They are consistent with numbers often cited in the media (e.g., Christian\nScience Monitor, November 7, 2008). The comparison with local students is based on official\nstatistics.\n\n\u00a9 2012 The Author\nThe Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies\n\n\fINCENTIVIZED PEER-TUTORING\n\n337\n\nimplications for China now and undoubtedly even more in the future as the trend\nof urbanization continues.\n\nThe responsibility of providing primary and secondary education lies with\nlocal governments in China. For local residents with hukou (household registra-\ntion card, an entitlement similar to local citizenship), primary education is\nnow almost free. However, migrants without hukou have to pay a very high\nfee to enter the local public schools. Most migrants cannot afford it, creating a\nhuge demand for paid education services provided by migrant children schools,\nregardless of their quality. Because students are geographically very mobile, cur-\nriculum in these schools typically follows standard national guidelines. In China,\nthe primary school curriculum is highly centralized. The Ministry of Education\nmakes sure that textbooks are more or less similar across the nation, and pro-\nvides rigid guidelines regarding every aspect of the curriculum, including sub-\njects offered, or even how each individual lecture should be taught. The teachers\nare expected to closely follow these guidelines. Migrant children schools also\noffer standard subjects such as math, Chinese, English, physical education,\nmusic, etc. Just like other Chinese schools, they put a lot more emphasis on\nmath, Chinese, and English, because these will eventually be tested in the pres-\ntigious national college entrance exam. Students typically spend the whole day in\nclass, and go home only in late afternoon.\n\nLocal governments not only refuse to lower the discriminating barrier so that\nmigrant children can enter the local public schools, but also try to control or even\neliminate migrant children schools. The motive is probably control over perma-\nnent migration. In 2006 the Beijing city government began a campaign to shut\ndown over 200 migrant children schools. The Shanghai city government followed\nsuit, and set a goal of eliminating all migrant children schools that did not meet\nthe high standards set by the local government by 2010. However, because the\nlocal governments have no plan to educate all migrant children with their own\nresources, it is impossible to completely root out these schools. When a school\nis closed down by the government, it usually reopens in another location with a\ndifferent name.\n\nFinancial constraints and adverse government policy seriously crippled the\ndevelopment of migrant children schools. Despite the fact that these schools are\nlocated in China\u2019s richest cities, they resemble schools in poor rural areas that lag\nbehind the urban public schools by several decades. Given the political realities, it\nis almost impossible to improve education quality in these migrant schools through\nmore traditional methods. We are therefore left with very few options. Improving\npeer-assisted learning is one of them.\n\nIn our study the local government (i.e., the Shanghai local government) had\nestablished School A only one year before our experiment. The government sent a\nformal teacher from a local public school to serve as the headmaster; this was the\n\n\u00a9 2012 The Author\nThe Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies\n\n\f338\n\nthe developing economies\n\nonly staff member on a regular government payroll.2 School B, a more typical\nmigrant children school, was several years old and a private school owned by its\nheadmaster. Because of the difference in ownership, School A had better and\nself-owned facilities, possibly better school administration, and possibly higher\nteacher morale. The most important benefit, however, was government recognition.\nNote that migrant schools are often closed by the government at will. Since School\nA was recognized by the local government, it was free from such arbitrary treatment.\nThe teachers and students in these two schools were otherwise quite similar. The\nstudents were all migrant children. There were 419 students in School A (excluding\ngrade 1) in 2007. The average number of students per class was 47. There were 692\nstudents in School B (also excluding grade 1) in 2007. The average number of stu-\ndents per class was 53. The class size in both schools was quite big. Student tuition\nand fees (about RMB500 or US$60 a semester) were the main source of funding\nin each school. There was no government funding of any sort in either school.\n\nThe conditions in migrant children schools make it impossible to implement\na traditional peer-tutoring program. For example, tutor\u2013tutee study sessions\u2014\ntypical in traditional tutoring programs\u2014are not feasible since migrant children\nschools have limited available space. Also, students have a full-day schedule. And\nit is neither safe to keep students after school nor possible to do so, since everyone\nwants to go home to dinner after a long school day. Students may live far apart\nfrom each other in a large city like Shanghai. This is also the reason we did not\nwant to randomly assign tutor and tutee (see Section III). We were hoping that\nstudents living close to each other would team up and have more interaction after\nschool, but there was no way for us to require them to do so in such a large city.\nTeachers are hired on a contractual basis at a low wage (typically about US$100,\nor RMB 700\u2013800 per month). Job loyalty is therefore very low. For example, a\nsalesgirl with a senior high school diploma might come to work as a teacher for a\nyear or two, and then move on to another job unrelated to teaching. To save money,\nstudent\u2013teacher ratios are typically quite high. Asking these teachers to do any-\nthing beyond their normal teaching duties, such as supervising the tutoring process,\nis unreasonable. Additionally, schools have little incentive to improve teaching.\nThey are for-profit businesses with a short expected time horizon. They may be\nclosed down by the government at any time simply because the government does\nnot want them to exist. Whether the schools provide high-quality teaching is not a\nconcern of the government.\n\n2 One strategy the government takes is to retain and control a small number of migrant schools\nafter closing down others. This is because of strong pressure from the central government, the\nmedia, and the international community. Then some limited resources may be provided to these\nselected schools. To reduce its payout, the local government would not provide help to the migrant\nschools without controlling the numbers of such schools.\n\n\u00a9 2012 The Author\nThe Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies\n\n\fINCENTIVIZED PEER-TUTORING\n\n339\n\nWhile some of these scenarios are unique to China, most are common in\nmany developing countries. In general, the conditions that have made traditional\npeer-tutoring programs successful in developed countries are missing in our\ncontext.\n\nIII. PROGRAM DESIGN\n\nConsider one program class in our study. At the beginning of the academic\nsemester, we invited an equal number of weak and strong students to participate\nin our Peer-Tutoring Program. Priority was given to those who did worst/best in the\nfinal exams in the previous semester.3 Information sessions were organized in each\nclass to introduce the program details to the prospective students. These students\nbrought home a formal invitation letter that also listed the program outlines. We\nasked the parents of the invited children to sign and return the invitation letters if\nthey wanted their children to participate.\n\nEach weak student was matched with a strong student in his or her own class\nwho served as a peer tutor. Both had a say in choosing their partner. The voluntary\nmatching process was coordinated by our enumerators and the teachers. We did not\nopt for random assignment mainly because we believed that teachers and students\ncould use their private information to improve the quality of matching, which may\ncontribute to better tutoring outcomes.\n\nWe encouraged the tutors and tutees to interact more frequently between classes\nand at lunchtime but we did not formally require them to do anything during school\nor after school, nor did we ask the teachers to pay special attention to our programs.\nOur design was intended to reduce external involvement in the project such that its\nsuccess did not depend on such efforts. As we discussed in detail in Section II,\nmore structured peer interaction and teacher monitoring was difficult to implement\nin our context. According to our interviews at the end of the program, informal\npeer-tutoring did occur. For example, the tutors helped the tutees do their problem\nsets, explained to them things they did not understand well, and so on.\n\nThe key to our experiment was a formal incentive contract (tournament)\ndesigned to encourage the tutors\u2019 efforts. The output of a tutor\u2019s effort was\nmeasured by improvement in the academic performance of his or her partner over\nthe semester. The teacher\u2019s behavior and disciplinary environment did not affect\nthe effectiveness of the tournament because they are common shocks to all tutors\nin the same class (Lazear and Rosen 1981). The improvement was defined as the\ndifference between the rank of the total scores of the semester finals immediately\nbefore and following the program.\n\n3 Since ranking of the final was public information in these schools our invitation did not reveal\n\nadditional information.\n\n\u00a9 2012 The Author\nThe Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies\n\n\f340\n\nthe developing economies\n\nWe did not use simple linear contracts, which would have provided teachers with\nthe perverse incentive to inflate tutees\u2019 grades. Shastry and Linden (2009) provide\none example that teachers in developing countries may inflate student performance\nto help them get more resources from aid agencies. Tournament helped us fix the\ntotal amount of resources provided to a particular class (RMB 300 per monetary-\nprogram class in our design) so that teachers would have minimal incentives to\ndistort the educational outcome. Using a linear contract also requires that different\ntests are comparable so that students could be paid according to the score differ-\nence. This is unrealistic in poor countries. Note that in China even the most\nimportant college entrance exam scores cannot be compared over different years.\nIt is probably not a coincidence that the most well-known cash incentive program\nperformed in a poor country used tournament as well (Kremer, Miguel, and\nThornton 2009).\n\nOur experiment provided two types of incentive contract to the peer tutors: the\nnonmonetary incentive peer-tutoring program (or nonmonetary program) and the\nmonetary incentive peer-tutoring program (or monetary program). Students and\nparents were aware of the types of program they would participate in at the very\nbeginning of the semester.\n\nLet us first consider the monetary program. A typical program class in our\nexperiment had ten peer tutors and ten weak students. The top prize of RMB 100\n(about one-fifth of a semester\u2019s tuition and fees) was awarded to the tutor whose\npartner made the largest improvement during the semester.4 Four second prizes of\nRMB 50 went to the four tutors whose partners made the next four largest improve-\nments. Five third prizes (small gifts) were awarded to the rest of the tutors. An\nofficial certificate of award, which clearly stated the achievement and the level of\naward, accompanied each prize. There was also public recognition at each school\u2019s\nawards assembly held for students and teachers. The nonmonetary program was\nidentical, except that monetary rewards were removed.\n\nWe were careful not to provide direct incentives to the tutees because we\nwanted to clearly identify the consequences of strengthening the tutors\u2019 incen-\ntives alone. It is entirely plausible that allowing the winning tutor to share the\nprize with her partner (a type of group incentive, which is more difficult to\ninterpret) would improve our program effects and make the financial rewards\nmore equitable, but\nthis would be an entirely different economic problem.\nIn another working paper we report very encouraging program effects from a\nlarge-scale randomized experiment using the group-incentive scheme to motivate\npeer-tutoring.\n\n4 The size of the prize is relatively large. In a day trip (which cost RMB 70 per student) organized\n\nby School B, 56.2% of the students did not go because of economic reasons.\n\n\u00a9 2012 The Author\nThe Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies\n\n\fINCENTIVIZED PEER-TUTORING\n\n341\n\nIV. EVALUATION DESIGN\n\nA.\n\nSample\n\nBoth schools in our study had classes ranging from grade 1 to grade 6. Each\ngrade contained one to three classes, which were usually taught by the same set\nof teachers. We excluded all grade 1 students.5 This left us with ten classes from\nSchool A and 13 classes from School B. We randomly assigned ten classes (from\ndifferent school/grade combinations) to participate in the monetary program, and\nfour classes to participate in the nonmonetary program. The remaining nine classes\nwere comparison classes, which did not receive any intervention.\n\nThe intended treatment was not carried out in two School B classes, which\nincluded one monetary program class from grade 5, and one nonmonetary program\nclass from grade 6.6 These two were used as additional comparison classes in our\nanalysis. We later discovered that the historical academic information for the only\nSchool A class assigned to the nonmonetary program was missing, and thus had to\ndrop it from our analysis. This left us with nine monetary program classes, two\nnonmonetary program classes (both from School B), and 11 comparison classes.\nWe were interested mainly in the program effects for the tutees (i.e., the treated\nweak students). In a typical program class with 50 students, we invited ten or fewer\nstudents with the lowest pre-treatment scores to participate in our programs. In\nclasses with fewer (or more) than 50 students we invited fewer (or more) weak\nstudents to participate in our program so that the proportion of the invited weak\nstudents was about 20% of the class size. Table 1 sets out the basic structure of our\nfield experiment.\n\nAn evaluation sample (including control and treatment students) was used to\ncalculate program effects. The evaluation sample for calculating nonmonetary\nprogram effects was made up of treated weak students in two nonmonetary\nprogram classes and corresponding control students. The treated students (19 in\ntotal) were weak students from these two nonmonetary program classes (class 3.2\nand class 5.1 from School B). Because of the small number of nonmonetary\nprogram classes, to reduce estimation noises, we restricted the corresponding\ncontrol students to those that study in nearby comparison classes of the same\nschool/grade combination. The control students were those weak students (31\nin total) from other comparison classes (3.3, 5.2, and 5.3) in grades 3 and 5 from\nSchool B. Class 3.1 was not included because it is a monetary program class. So\nthe evaluation sample of the nonmonetary program included 19 treated students\nand 31 control students (see columns 1 and 2 of Table 2).\n\n5 They are not fit for our program on a regular basis as they do not have previous-semester scores in\n\nthe fall semester.\n\n6 It seems that teacher negligence was the main cause of the problem at least in one class.\n\n\u00a9 2012 The Author\nThe Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies\n\n\f342\n\nthe developing economies\n\nTABLE 1\n\nEvaluation Sampling Design\n\nNo. of Classes in School A\n\nNo. of Classes in School B\n\nControl Monetary Nonmonetary Total Control Monetary Nonmonetary\n\nTotal\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nGrade 2 1 (7)\nGrade 3 1 (10)\nGrade 4 1 (9)\nGrade 5 1 (8)\nGrade 6 0 (0)\n4 (34)\nTotal\n\n1 (8)\n1 (4)\n1 (8)\n1 (9)\n1 (7)\n5 (36)\n\n2 (15) 1 (10)\n2 (14) 1 (10)\n2 (17) 1 (10)\n2 (17) 2 (21)\n1 (7)\n2 (19)\n9 (70) 7 (70)\n\n1 (9)\n1 (9)\n1 (7)\n0 (0)\n1 (8)\n4 (33)\n\n0 (0)\n1 (9)\n0 (0)\n1 (10)\n0 (0)\n2 (19)\n\n2 (19)\n3 (28)\n2 (17)\n3 (31)\n3 (27)\n13 (122)\n\nNote: Number of weak students (about bottom 20% of a class) in parentheses.\n\n(3)\n\n0 (0)\n0 (0)\n0 (0)\n0 (0)\n0 (0)\n0 (0)\n\nTABLE 2\n\nSummary Statistics of Evaluation Samples\n\nSchool B Nonmonetary\n\nSchool A Monetary\n\nSchool B Monetary\n\nControl Treatment Diff.

It was composed of treated students and weak students in comparison\nclasses from the same school. Because almost every grade in each school had at\nleast one monetary program class, it was not necessary to restrict control students\nto those from the same grade/school combination. In total, the evaluation sample\nfor monetary program effects in School A included 36 treated students and 34\ncontrol students (columns 4 and 5 of Table 2); the evaluation sample for monetary\nprogram effects in School B included 33 treated students and 70 control students\n(columns 7 and 8 of Table 2).\n\n\u00a9 2012 The Author\nThe Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies\n\n\fINCENTIVIZED PEER-TUTORING\n\n343\n\nB. Outcomes\n\nThe main outcome of interest is whether the interventions improved the aca-\ndemic performance of the tutees. We used raw scores to measure academic\nperformance. Data from the pretreatment final exam (fall 2006) and the posttreat-\nment final exam (spring 2007) are available for both schools. The same grade in\ndifferent schools uses different exams. The classes in the same grade of a par-\nticular school use the same exams. In what follows, all raw scores are normalized\nrelative to the distribution of the pretreatment raw score in the comparison group\nin each school.7\n\nTable 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the evaluation samples in three dif-\nferent cases: (1) School B, nonmonetary program vs. comparison group (or treat-\nment vs. control); (2) School A, monetary program vs. comparison group; (3)\nSchool B, monetary program vs. comparison group. For example, the summary\nstatistics (for gender, school, and grade dummies, and scores before and after the\nprogram Score2006 and Score2007) of the evaluation sample of the nonmonetary\nprogram effects is reported in columns 1 and 2 of Table 2, by treatment and control\nstatus. Column 3 reports the difference of columns 1 and 2, and the stars denote the\nlevel of statistical significance in the t-test.\n\nMost of the pretreatment characteristics are balanced (i.e., with an insignificant\nt-test statistic) in Table 2. Our main confounding problem is that the pretreatment\nscores (Score2006) in the treatment groups seem to be systematically lower. In\nother words, the bottom students in the program classes are much weaker (in terms\nof the raw score) than their counterparts (in terms of the class ranking) in the\ncomparison classes.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that our evaluation design is fundamentally flawed.\nRandomization cannot guarantee complete pretreatment score balance, especially\nwhen the number of classes is relatively small, as in our case. We can further show\nthat the unbalanced score is mainly a problem in the senior grades (results\nomitted). We always report the results of separate regressions for the junior and\nsenior subsamples.\n\nC. Estimation Strategy\n\nSince we are interested in score improvement, a standard estimation strategy to\nuse is differences-in-differences. If the score improvement trend is similar for the\nweak students in both the program and comparison groups, the coefficient of\n\n7 For each school, we subtracted the mean of the control group\u2019s pretreatment score and divided it\nby its standard deviation. The raw score is the sum of the scores for all subjects taught in a school.\nChinese and math were taught in both schools. English was only taught in School A. Results based\non separate subjects are similar and omitted.\n\n\u00a9 2012 The Author\nThe Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies\n\n\f344\n\nthe developing economies\n\nthe interaction term in the following differences-in-differences regression (i.e., a3)\nwould yield unbiased estimates of the treatment effects.8\n\nY\ni\n\n=\n\n\u03b1\n1\n\nPost\n\n+\n\n\u03b1\n2\n\nTreatment\n\n+\n\n\u03b1\n3\n\nDD\n\n+\n\n\u03b2\nZ\n\nt\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\ni\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Yi is score, Post is the time dummy that equals 1 for spring 2007 and 0 for\nfall 2006, Treatment equals 1 for the treated group and 0 for the corresponding\ncontrol group, DD = Post \u00a5 Treatment is the diff-in-diff variable, and Zi contains\nother control variables including sex and class dummies.\n\nV. MAIN PROGRAM EFFECTS FOR TUTEES\n\nThe tutees in at least some groups seem to have benefited from the programs.\nFigure 1 plots the difference in the posttreatment and pretreatment raw scores.\nThe top, middle, and bottom rows correspond to three scenarios, respectively: (1)\nSchool B, nonmonetary program vs. comparison group; (2) School A, monetary\nprogram vs. comparison group; (3) School B, monetary program vs. comparison\ngroup. The program effects are quite significant in the top and middle panels. In\nother words, the tutees in the nonmonetary program and School A\u2019s monetary\nprogram experienced larger score improvement compared to those in the corre-\nsponding comparison groups. There seem to be no program effects in School B,\nsuggesting the impact is context dependent. More rigorous and detailed regression\nestimation results are reported below.\n\nA. Nonmonetary Program\n\nEven without monetary incentive, peer-tutoring seems to be effective. From\nTable 2, we can calculate from the summary statistics that the program effect is\n0.612 in terms of the raw score improvement.9 The DD estimation result (reported\nin column 1 of Table 3) is consistent with the back-of-envelope calculations.\nThe first column reports the results using raw score as the outcome variable and\ncontrolling various covariates in equation (1). The DD estimator is 0.615 and\nstatistically significant at the 5% level. This means that the nonmonetary program\nhelped the tutees gain an additional score improvement of 0.615 standard devia-\ntions. Because of the relatively small sample size, we will not report results by\ndifferent grades. Because of the panel data structure in diff-in-diff regression\nspecification, the sample size reported in column 1 of Table 3 (N = 100) doubles\nthat reported in Table 2 columns 1 and 2 (N = 31 + 19 = 50). The same is also true\nfor the following diff-in-diff regression samples.\n\n8 If the weak students are less likely to make progress, this will strengthen our program results.\n9 (-1.17 + 0.742)-(-2.12 + 1.08) = 0.612\n\n\u00a9 2012 The Author\nThe Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies\n\n\fINCENTIVIZED PEER-TUTORING\n\n345\n\nFig. 1.

The 3rd and 4th columns report the results for grades 2\u20133 and 4\u20136 in School\nA, respectively. The estimated treatment effects are slightly weaker for the younger\nstudents in School A, though the difference is quite small. Both are statistically\nsignificant at the 10% level. The 5th column reports the results for School B. The\nestimated DD estimator is only 0.155, and is not statistically significant. This is\nlargely because of the ineffectiveness of the program for the older students. The\nDD estimator for the younger or grade 2\u20133 students (reported in the 6th column)\nis 0.874, and is statistically significant at the 10% level. For the older or grade 4\u20135\nstudents, the DD estimator (reported in the 7th column) is -0.131 and not statis-\ntically significant. In summary, except for the older students in School B, the\nmonetary program is effective and helps the weak students gain an additional score\nimprovement of about 0.9 standard deviations. The monetary program is about 0.5\ntimes more effective than the nonmonetary program.\n\nWhy is the program effect weaker in School B, especially in its senior classes?\nOur interviews with the students suggest that there were significantly fewer actual\npeer-tutoring activities in School B\u2019s senior program classes. Teacher negligence\nand low incentives also appeared to be more serious in these classes as they failed\n\n\u00a9 2012 The Author\nThe Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies\n\n\fINCENTIVIZED PEER-TUTORING\n\n347\n\nto conduct the actual pairing of the assigned tutors and tutees in two of the program\nclasses, forcing us to drop these two classes from the program class list. We are\nnot sure about the cause of this noncompliance. It may be due to the differences in\nthese two schools mentioned above. Kremer, Miguel, and Thornton (2009) also\nfound that the compliance rate and the effects of their scholarship program was\ncontext dependent. Another possibility is that later-life-stage intervention is more\ndifficult (Carneiro and Heckman 2003). The age difference is also consistent with\nfindings in educational psychology (Cohen, Kulik, and Kulik 1982). We suggest\nthat readers use caution in interpreting our results (including both monetary and\nnonmonetary program effects) based on School B, which is included in the current\npaper mainly as a reference.\n\nThere is no evidence that the program effects differ by gender or by the gender\n\ncomposition of the pairs. These results are not reported.\n\nC.\n\nSecond Semester Results\n\nThere is a large body of literature in economics and psychology that suggests\nthat incentive contracts and material rewards may undermine voluntary coopera-\ntion.10 We find no such evidence in our programs. This is not surprising, since\nthere was a minimum amount of spontaneous peer-tutoring in the absence of our\ninterventions.\n\nThe incentives provided to the tutors in our programs were removed in the fall\nsemester of the 2007\u20138 school year in both schools. Testing long-run program\neffects after the removal of the financial incentive is a common practice to test for\nthe presence of the motivational crowding-out effect (Kremer, Miguel, and Thorn-\nton 2009). Because the tutees knew their tutors were paid, the presence of tutor\npayment might have crowded out tutee motivation if they had a sufficiently high\ncooperative spirit. And the tutees may have become discouraged because of the\nwithdrawal of the monetary program. It is also possible that payment may have\nreduced the tutors\u2019 intrinsic motivation to interact with the tutees. And they may\nhave reduced the level of interaction with the tutees below the pretreatment level\nafter the removal of the cash incentive.\n\nWe were only able to track the follow-up records in School A since the other\nschool was hit by a sudden policy change around the middle of the spring semester\nwhen the local government asked many migrant children schools to close at the end\nof the academic year. Using the same pretreatment score, the program effect on raw\nscores is 0.80 in the second semester (significant at the 5% level), slightly smaller\nthan the first-semester effect (see column 1 in Table 4). This suggests the existence\n\n10 For a discussion on economics see Mellstro\u0308m and Johannesson (2008).

CONCLUSION\n\nThis paper reports the results of a remedial education field experiment that used an\nincentive contract to encourage peer tutors to help their underperforming class-\nmates in migrant children schools in China. Our experimental evidence suggests\nthat paying peer tutors has a significant impact on tutees\u2019 grades in these schools.\nIf the program studied here can be successfully scaled up across the country, the\npolicy impact will be very significant because a huge number of migrant children\nlag behind students in the public education system.\n\nScaling up the program is also quite feasible. As both one-to-one peer-tutoring\nand merit-based scholarships are common practice in China, combining these\ntwo into an incentivized peer-tutoring program would be readily accepted by\nmany teachers and schools. In our experience, teachers embraced our program with\nmuch enthusiasm. Therefore many migrant/rural schools may be willing to adopt\nsuch a program if there are such opportunities. At the same time, some funding\n\n\u00a9 2012 The Author\nThe Developing Economies \u00a9 2012 Institute of Developing Economies\n\n\fINCENTIVIZED PEER-TUTORING\n\n349\n\nfor merit-based scholarship programs already exists. For example, Cyrus Tang\nFoundation has offered scholarships (largely based on merit) to 24,722 students in\nrural China from 2006 to 2010. If nongovernment organizations and government\nagencies can incorporate incentivized peer-tutoring into their existing merit-based\nscholarship and conditional cash transfer programs, smart but poor rural children\ncan get some extra funding for their education, and underperforming rural students\ncan improve their academic performance with the help of their peers.\n\nIncentivized peer-tutoring is also free of the moral weakness believed to be\ninherent in merit-based scholarships. Many argue that the benefits flow dispropor-\ntionately to well-off pupils and exacerbate inequality (Orfield 2002). This argument\nis particularly powerful for primary education, where equity seems to be a more\nimportant goal than efficiency. To get the prize in an incentivized peer-tutoring\nprogram, the tutors (who are also high-performing students) need to effectively\nstrengthen their underperforming tutees, contributing to a unique equity-enhancing\noutcome.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBanerjee, Abhijit V.; Shawn Cole; Esther Duflo; and Leigh Linden. 2007. \u201cRemedying\nEducation: Evidence from Two Randomized Experiments in India.\u201d Quarterly Journal\nof Economics 122, no. 3: 1235\u201364.\n\nCarneiro, Pedro, and James Heckman. 2003. \u201cHuman Capital Policy.\u201d NBER Working\n\nPaper no. 9495.

It places teaching and learning commitments\nand responsibilities on students. Considerable evidence supports the positive effects of peer tutoring, including cognitive\ngains, improved communication, self-confidence, and social support among students. Peer tutors are also said to better\nunderstand the learning problems of fellow peer learners than teachers do.\nObjective: This study intended to facilitate the development of \u2018cooperative learning\u2019 among nursing students through a\npeer-tutoring scheme.\nStudy method: Undergraduate nursing students were invited to join a peer-tutoring scheme. Fourteen students studying\nyear 3 were recruited to serve as peer tutors and 16 students from year 2 of the same program participated as tutees.\nPeer tutors attended a training workshop and received a guideline for peer-tutoring activities. They were to provide a\ntotal of \u201810 weekly tutoring sessions throughout the semester on a one-to-one basis for their tutees. Focus groups and\nindividual interviews were conducted in the middle and at the end of the semester to evaluate the students\u2019 experiences\nin the tutoring process.\nResults: Content analysis of the interview scripts identified that students had both positive and negative experiences\nfrom the peer tutoring, but that positive experiences predominated. Positive aspects included enhancement of learning\nskills/intellectual gains and personal growth. Negative experiences stemmed mainly from frustrations in dealing with\nmismatched learning styles between tutors and tutees, and the required time commitment.\nConclusions: Both tutors and tutees benefited to some extent from this peer-tutoring process. Further studies in an\neducation program for students in all years should be implemented to examine peer-tutoring effects. Implementation of\npeer tutoring should address the frustrations and difficulties encountered by the students to facilitate better outcomes.\nr 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nStudents in nursing are expected to be able to analyze,\nsynthesize, and communicate information in order to\nsolve clinical problems in their professional careers.\nThese skills are better developed through an active\nlearning process in which students take a deep learning\napproach, and develop critical thinking and effective\ncommunication (Loke et al., 1997).\n\n2. Peer tutoring\n\nPeer tutoring, as a system of partnership in the\nlearning process, involves students helping each other to\nlearn and learning themselves by teaching. It places the\ncommitment and responsibility on the students in the\nteaching and learning experience (Topping, 1996).\nAccording to Moust and Schmidt (1994), peer tutors\nbetter understand the learning problems of their fellow\nstudents than teachers do, since they have recent similar\nlearning experiences. While peer tutoring could make\nlearning more efficient for the tutees, it also has benefits\nfor the tutors (Goodlad and Hirst, 1989; Jones, 1995;\nTopping, 1996).\n\nPeer tutoring has been used in a variety of contexts.\nSome peer-tutoring schemes were involved in teaching at\nelementary and secondary levels (Greenwood et al.,\n1988, Jenkins and Jenkins, 1985; Stephenson and\nWarwick, 2001), or teaching children with learning\ndisabilities, and mental or physical disabilities (Barfield\n\net al., 1998; Fenrick and Peterson, 1984; Osguthorpe and\nScruggs, 1986). Peer tutoring is increasing popularity in\ntertiary education (Anderson and Boud, 1996; Fantuzzo\net al., 1989a, b; Saunders, 1992), such as in education\n(Rittschof and Griffin, 2001), physics (Booth and James,\n2001), mathematics (Evans et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2001),\npsychology (Potter et al., 1998), medicine (Goodfellow,\n2001; Johansen et al., 1992; Sobral, 2002; Solomon and\nCrowe, 2001), and nursing (Clarke and Feltham, 1990).\nClarke and Feltham (1990) stated that the process of\npeer tutoring can enhance learning skills that contribute\nto higher academic achievement. Griffin and Griffin\n(1997, 1998) argued that peer tutoring had no measur-\nable impact on students\u2019 achievement, but students\nin studying course materials. Peer\nfound it helpful\ntutoring also facilitates cooperative learning. Students\nwho engage in interaction with their peers are expected\nto externalize their thoughts, and to make explicit their\nqueries related to the subject. The situation provides\nopportunities for students to discover their inadequacies\nand to correct misunderstandings, and it encourages\nopenness to others\u2019 ideas (Johnston, 1995). In a review\nof studies on peer tutoring, Hill and Topping (1995)\nfound considerable evidence of positive effects for the\ntutors, including cognitive gains, improved communica-\ntion, and self-confidence. Fantuzzo et al. (1992, 1989b)\nidentified a positive effect on increasing social support\namong the students.\n\nA peer-tutoring scheme project was launched with the\naim to enhance the development of learning skills and\ninterpersonal skills among undergraduate nursing stu-\ndents. This\nstudy was conducted to examine the\nexperiences of the nursing students who participated in\nthe peer-tutoring scheme incorporated in the Bachelor of\nScience Degree in Nursing Program in Hong Kong.\n\n3. Study method\n\nThis study was conducted with a cohort of nursing\nstudents who were studying the second and third years\nof the undergraduate program. The second year students\nwere taking a subject \u2018\u2018Maternal and Child Care\u2019\u2019, which\nincluded weekly 2-h lectures and 1-h laboratory sessions\nfor one 14-week semester. During the time, the students\nalso spent 2-days per week in a clinical placement in\nmaternity and infant care units. Peer tutoring was used\nas an adjunct to the regular lectures, laboratory, and\nclinical placement.\n\nThe students were informed that that the peer tutoring\nproject was integrated into the teaching of the subject.\nStudents were invited to join the scheme on a voluntary\nbasis, and were asked to sign a written consent. They\nwere assured that their decision would not affect in any\nway their assessment results for the subject. They were\nalso reassured that data collected would be used for\n\n\fARTICLE IN PRESS\n\nA.Y. Loke, F.L.W.

They\nwere aged 20\u201322 years, and 14 of them were female.\nStudents in the third year of study in the same program\nthat had satisfied the requirements of the \u2018\u2018Maternal and\nChild Care\u2019\u2019 subject, and had relevant clinical compe-\ntence in their previous year of study were invited as\ntutors. Fourteen out of 50 (28% of the class) students\ntook part as tutors, and they were aged 21\u201323 years and\n12 were female.\n\nBefore the peer-tutorial activities commenced, a 2-h\ntraining workshop was arranged to introduce the concept\nof peer tutoring, the ground rules of the peer-tutoring\nscheme, the roles and responsibilities of the tutors, and\nsome basic teaching and learning principles. Student peer\ntutors were also provided with a guidebook developed by\nthe project team. It outlined the information and skills\nthey would need as peer tutors (Loke et al., 2002). A set of\ncourse materials was also provided. It\nincluded the\nsyllabus, learning objectives, and covered content.\n\nteam arranged small\n\nThe tutors and tutees were required to have 1-h\ntutoring sessions on a weekly basis throughout the\nsemester. The project\ntutorial\nrooms in the university for these tutoring sessions, and\nserved as resource persons, providing ongoing support\nwhenever it was deemed necessary. Tutors and tutees\nwere expected to identify learning issues and objectives,\nand to keep a record by noting the concerns and the\nissues discussed in each session. The progress of the\ntutoring activities were monitored in group meetings\nthat were separately held between the project team, and\nthe tutors and tutees during the 4th, 7th, and the 10th\nweeks of the 14-week semester. The meetings were to\nprovide a forum for the tutors or tutees to share their\nexperience and any difficulties encountered.\n\nData were collected from group and individual\ninterviews. Upon completion of the project, tutors and\ntutees that had raised pertinent issues in the group\ninterviews were invited for further individual interviews.\nDuring the interviews, questions were asked regarding\nthe peer-tutoring experience and whether they had\ngained from the experience; difficulties encountered;\nand their evaluation of the scheme. All interviews were\nrecorded by tape, and transcribed. Typical quotations\nfrom interviews were extracted to illustrate the major\nthemes and categories that emerged from the data.\n\n4. Results\n\nQualitative content analysis of the interviews revealed\nboth positive and negative comments on the peer-\ntutoring process. Students reported that positive aspects\n\nincluded enhancement of deep learning, cooperative\nlearning, and personal achievements/gain, and they\nreported the difficulties\nthey encountered in peer-\ntutoring activities.\n\n4.1. Enhancement of deep learning\n\nBoth tutors and tutees realized that the experience had\nexpanded their ways of learning and thinking. Students\nfound that they had to be more systematic in their\nlearning, to reflect on their experiences, and they had to\nintegrate theory with practice. The following comments\nby tutors and tutees demonstrated the enhancement of\ndeep learning, which involved critical\nthinking and\nreflective learning:\n\nWhen the tutee/tutor asked questions that I hadn\u2019t\nthought of before, I learned the way the tutee/tutor\nthought and asked myself why I hadn\u2019t asked these\nin the past, she\nquestions. I seldom asked \u2018why\u2019\n[tutee] stimulated me to think from another perspec-\ntive. (tutors 2, 3, 5) (tutee 9)\nWhen I had my obstetric clinical placement, I was\nnot able to apply the theory to practice. Now, I can\nrecall some of the cases that I had come across, and\nintegrate them with textbook theories to explain to\nmy tutee. (tutors 1, 3, 5, 11, 14)\nWe shared our clinical experiences, then I asked\nmyself if I would have the same judgment, and how I\nwould have handled the situation. We do reflect on\nour clinical encounters. (tutee 6, 11,12)\n\n4.1.1. Problem solving and critical thinking\n\nMany tutors and tutees appreciated the opportunity\nto ask or to answer questions that stimulated their\nthinking in the tutoring process. It was obvious from the\nthe tutoring process enhanced the\ninterviews\ndevelopment of problem-solving and critical-thinking\nskills. The following quotations are some examples:\n\nthat\n\nMy tutee/tutor challenged me about why I do things\nin a particular way. I used to follow strictly what the\nteacher or the literature said. But now, I have started\nto question if it should be done in that way. Since I\nhave been asked several more times, I\u2019ve started to\nuse a critical mind to evaluate what I have done, and\nto think of alternative methods. (tutors 1, 3, 7, 14)\n(tutees 4, 14, 15)\nShe (tutee) would only recall if she had studied it\nbefore and try to locate the information in her notes.\nI taught her to start thinking from the basics. For\nexample, to start with the functions of an organ, if\nthat fails, then what would be affected? That is to\nthink step-by-step,\nlogically. It does not require\nmemorization. (tutors 1, 10)\n\n\f240\n\nA.Y. Loke, F.L.W. Chow / International Journal of Nursing Studies 44 (2007) 237\u2013244\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\nMy tutor taught me how to think from the basic and\nto go logically step-by-step, and not to memorize the\ninformation in our textbook or lecture notes. This\nhelped me to relearn my study approach. (tutee 4, 9)\n\n4.2.1. Alternative approach to cooperative learning\n\nIn order to cope with the tutees\u2019 questions, the tutors\nlearned that textbook knowledge was not sufficient to\nanswer all questions. They learned that they had to\nexplore alternatives in searching for answers.\n\n4.1.2. Systematic approach to learning\n\nBoth tutors and tutees reported intellectual gains from\n\nbeing more systematic in their learning.\n\nI\u2019ve become more systematic in learning since I\u2019ve\nhad to organize the materials beforehand, and to\nexpress myself clearly to help her [tutee] understand.\n(tutors 2, 7, 9)\nMy thinking has become more systematic and\norganized. Studying was unstructured for me in the\npast, but now that I have to present to another\nperson clearly and have him/her understand, I have\nchanged. This has trained me to be more organized\nand systematic. (tutors 1, 5, 9)\n\n4.2. Cooperative learning\n\nApart from deep learning skills, participation in the\npeer-tutoring scheme enhanced students\u2019 cooperative\nlearning. Both tutors and tutees acknowledged that it\nwas a mutual process that went both ways.\n\nI didn\u2019t know the answers to some questions, so we\nwent back to read and then discuss in our next\nmeeting. She even taught me things that I didn\u2019t\nknow; it was good that we could learn from each\nother. (tutors 2, 5) (tutees 1, 5)\nSometimes I thought I understood, but when the\ntutee/tutor asked me more questions, I realized that I\ndidn\u2019t. This helped me to realize my own inadequa-\ncies. We searched for information together from a\nvariety of sources, and we both learned. (tutors 3, 6,\n13, 14) (tutees 3, 8)\n\nThe following quotes\n\nfrom the interviews were\nevidence that even tutors experienced increased con-\nfidence in their own learning.\n\nI used to rely on others when I prepared my\nassignments, now I\u2019m more independent. Perhaps\nit\u2019s because I have to teach someone younger than me.\nI\u2019m now doing more preparation and other things by\nmyself and we learn together. (tutors 1, 9, 11)\nI\u2019m more confident in answering questions that I\nknow, such as the subject \u2018\u2018Maternal and Infant\nCare\u2019\u2019. I was rather hesitant when I couldn\u2019t answer\nher questions at first, but the tutee/tutor didn\u2019t mind\nand we both learned together. (tutors 1, 8) (tutee 3)\nThe peer tutoring sessions provided me with oppor-\ntunities to ask questions. I became more ready to ask\nquestions in my own class and more active in\nlearning. (tutor 8) (tutee 8)\n\nIf I\u2019m not certain about an answer, I\u2019ll tell my tutee/\ntutor honestly that I\u2019m not sure, and I\u2019ll search for\nthe answer in the textbook. I\u2019ll also reflect on my own\nclinical experience, and will check the practice\nprotocols in several hospitals to share. It\u2019s like we\nboth have more clinical exposure. (tutors 1, 5) (tutees\n5, 11)\nIt is meaningless to repeat what we\u2019ve been told in\nlectures, so I did literature searches on the Web and\ndiscussed my findings with the tutee/tutor. In the past,\nI\u2019d only studied the lecture notes and hadn\u2019t searched\nfor additional information, but now I\u2019ll search more\nmyself. This has broadened my scope in searching for\ninformation. (tutors 1, 2, 6) (tutees 7, 16)\n\n4.3. Personal gains/growth\n\nApart from learning skills and cooperative learning,\nthey also claimed that participation in the peer-tutoring\nscheme enhanced their personal growth, which would be\nuseful in their subsequent study and work lives.\n\n4.3.1. Communication skills\n\nThis was one of the areas that participants most\nfrequently commented on. Students reported that they\nlearned to respect one another and to communicate\nbetter in the tutor\u2013tutee relationship. Here are some of\nthe students\u2019 comments.\n\nI learned how to communicate with others, such as,\nwhat language to use, how to approach, and what\nkind of attitude I should have when I teach someone\nelse. (tutors 5, 9)\nI learned many communication skills. When I\u2019d faced\ndifficult patients in the past, I would escape from the\nsituation. But in the peer-tutoring process, I had to\nface the difficulties and try to talk to the tutee. Now,\nwhen I meet patients who don\u2019t cooperate, I\u2019ll try my\nbest to talk to them. I won\u2019t escape nowy (tutors 3,\n8, 9, 14)\nI\u2019ve learned to give clear explanations, and am now\nmore articulate in expressing myself. (tutor 9)\nI\u2019ve become more tactful in handling what I used to\ncall\n\u2018I\u2019ve learned how to ask\nquestions to stimulate thinking, and how to give\nexplanations or answer questions systematically and\nclearly. (tutors 2, 8)\n\n\u2018stupid\u2019 questions.\n\nStudents also reported that they had learned how to\nbe more open, more understanding, and more suppor-\ntive in the didactic relationship.\n\n\fARTICLE IN PRESS\n\nA.Y. Loke, F.L.W. Chow / International Journal of Nursing Studies 44 (2007) 237\u2013244\n\n241\n\nIt\u2019s important to accommodate one another\u2019s needs\nand it\u2019s important to understand the other\u2019s situa-\ntion. This\nis because we can\u2019t have adequate\npreparation each time. Understanding is fundamen-\ntal to developing a friendly collaborative relation-\nship. (tutors 1, 5) (tutees 10, 15)\nI learned that I should have more patience. This also\nworks when I have to teach health lessons for our\nclients. I\u2019ve also learned to be a good listener. I\nshould listen when others want to express themselves.\n(tutors 1, 8, 9, 12)\n\n4.3.2. Time management\n\nStudents, especially the tutors, claimed that they\nlearned how to better organize their schedules in order\nto accommodate the tutoring sessions.\n\nAlthough it was hard to fit the tutorial sessions into\nmy schedule, I realized that it was worthwhile, for I\nrealized that even if I hadn\u2019t had the tutoring\nsessions, I wouldn\u2019t have been doing anything (in\nthose hours)yor maybe I\u2019d be sleeping. (tutor 3)\n(tutee 5, 6, 13, 15)\n\nSome tutors developed a stronger sense of responsi-\n\nbility and were more active in learning.\n\nNow I\u2019m a more serious learner. I realized that the\nmore I put into learning, the greater the reward.\nWhen I study now, I try to read from a wider scope,\nand won\u2019t wait until examination. (tutors 2, 3) (tutees\n6, 12)\nI feel an obligation and responsibility to teach and/or\nlearn. I also feel that the teachers are serious about\nour learning and that I am part of the team. (tutors 2,\n3, 12) (tutee 8, 10, 12)\n\n4.3.3. Social gain\n\nMany tutors and tutees appreciated the chance to\nexpand their circle of friends and valued the friendships\nthat developed through the arrangement. They were able\nto share worries and concerns, other than just academic\nmatters. The following are students\u2019 comments on their\nrelationships:\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to get to know schoolmates from other\nclasses. This provided me with an opportunity to get\nto know them. It\u2019s nice to have a \u2018little sister/big\nsister\u2019 in the program. (tutors 2, 9) (tutees 1, 2, 4)\nWe started off with lots of conflicts, but near the end,\nwe were like friends. She even called me when she\nencountered personal as well as academic problems.\n(tutors 4, 9)\nWe shared our concerns about clinical placements\nand trusted each other enough not to tell anyone.\nThis made me feel that it\u2019s a close relationship. We\n\neven talked about our concerns about future job\nopportunities in nursing. (tutors 5, 10) (tutee 8)\n\n4.4. Difficulties encountered in the peer-tutoring process\n\nDespite students\u2019 enjoyment of the tutoring process\nand their perceptions of\nthey also\nexperienced frustrations and disappointments. Causes\nof these frustrations usually stemmed from passivity in\nlearning, punctuality, commitment, inadequate knowl-\nedge, and mismatches.\n\nits usefulness,\n\n4.4.1. Passivity in learning\n\nIt was frustrating to tutors when the tutees did not\ncome prepared to the tutoring sessions, but expected the\ntutors to repeat explanations that had been given in\nlectures. Here is an example:\n\nIn several sessions, the tutee/tutor had not done her\npart in preparing for the session, and we had to go\nthrough the notes, and give explanations that were\nlike those the teacher gave in class. This was\nfrustrating for mey (tutors 1, 10) (tutee 1)\n\n4.4.2. Time commitment and punctuality\n\nSome students said that it was difficult to schedule a\ntime that was convenient for both individuals as they\nhad other obligations. Some tutors regarded the effort of\npreparing the tutoring sessions as demanding. Punctu-\nality was also a concern for peer-tutoring participants.\n\nTwice, she [tutee] was late; I had to wait for 45\nminutes. I couldn\u2019t find her. It was difficult and\nupsetting. I wondered if there was something wrong\nwith me. (tutors 3, 9) (tutee 12)\nApproaching the end of the semester, we were busy\nwith our own assignments, it was difficult to arrange\na suitable time, and I found preparing for tutoring to\nbe very demandingy (tutors 2, 10) (tutee 4, 11, 14)\n\n4.4.3. Inadequate knowledge\n\nAnother area of concern was not having enough\nknowledge to teach. The following quotations highlight\nthe issue.\n\nyI don\u2019t think I have an in-depth understanding of\nthe subject matter and of the clinical applications to\ngive full explanationsy (tutors 2, 4, 9)\nWe don\u2019t have the knowledge and can\u2019t give answers\nto all questions straight awayyI have to wait until\nthe following week before I can get the answer.\n(tutors 4, 8)\nThe tutor didn\u2019t have adequate knowledge to teach,\nand often couldn\u2019t answer my questions. It wasn\u2019t\nuseful to just keep referring back to the notes. (tutees\n8, 10)\n\n\f242\n\nA.Y. Loke, F.L.W. Chow / International Journal of Nursing Studies 44 (2007) 237\u2013244\n\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n\n4.4.4. Mismatched styles\n\nThere might be discrepancies between the personal\nand learning styles of tutors and that of tutees, and this\nmight create hurdles in the tutoring process.\n\nI do see that there are differences in our personalities\nand styles\u2014and these weren\u2019t easy to resolvey\n(tutor 9)\n\n5. Discussion\n\nsought answers\n\nidentified enhancement of\n\nThis study has provided an understanding of students\u2019\nexperiences with peer tutoring in the context of nursing\neducation in Hong Kong. The study showed that\nstudents who participated in the peer-tutoring scheme\nbenefited from the experience in various ways. First, the\nstudents\nlearning skills/\nintellectual gains that improved reflective and critical\nto\nthinking abilities. Both parties\nproblems from various sources of\ninformation and\nshared clinical experience in cooperative learning.\nSecondly, peer tutoring provided the opportunity to\ndevelop \u2018transferable\u2019 personal skills, such as commu-\ninterpersonal, and time management skills.\nnication,\nStudents also identified personal growth,\nsuch as\nincreased confidence, and becoming more active and\nresponsible for\ntheir own learning. Students also\ntreasured the opportunity to come to know other\nstudents in the same program. Friendships, which\nallowed sharing of concerns and worries outside\nacademic matters, provided an alternate source of\nsupport.\nThe\n\nstudents who\nparticipated in the peer tutoring had utilized reflective\nthinking and increased critical thinking. As suggested by\nHill and Topping (1995), teaching in a tutorial setting as\nopposed to a didactic lecture setting demands that one\nreally comes to grips with the knowledge in order to\nrender it meaningful\nto the learner. Peer tutoring\nenabled the students to achieve a deeper understanding\nof\nthe subject matter by re-organizing the existing\nknowledge, clarifying and exemplifying the knowledge,\nand applying the knowledge in practice (Topping, 1996).\nIn other words, the process involved new associations\nand integration of the concepts such that students would\nbe able to apply the knowledge and skills to new\nsituations.\n\ninterview data showed that\n\nin communication,\n\nStudents improved communication skills and clarify-\ning skills, which facilitated effective tutorial discussion.\nsuch as asking less\nStrategies\nthe beginning and then\ncomplicated questions at\nbuilding up to more-complex questions, and how to be\nan approachable tutor and sensitive to needs of the\ntutees, were seen as useful. Interesting discussions during\npeer-tutoring sessions offered new perspectives, sponta-\n\nneous debate, generated energy and enthusiasm, and led\nenhancing learning\nto optimal participation,\nthrough articulation.\n\nthus\n\nIt was also apparent from the findings that the peer-\ntutoring program could be used to cultivate a coopera-\ntive-learning environment in which the students support\none another in their learning. The scheme provided an\ninteractive-communication environment that developed\nsupportive relationships between the tutors and tutees,\nwhich is not only career enhancing but also an\nimportant source of student support. The findings\nshowed that other than knowledge exchange, a mutual\nsense of trust was established. Some students even\nconfided their own experiences\nto each other or\ndifficulties in dealing with schoolwork, and how they\nstruggled with assignments and demands from the\nlecturers.\n\nThe peer-tutoring scheme was successful in encoura-\nging students to accept their responsibility for their\nlearning. This is consistent with the literature that peer\ntutoring provides students with opportunities to develop\ntransferable skills, such as communication and inter-\npersonal skills (Hill and Topping, 1995). It was apparent\nthat tutors developed confidence to ask questions in\nclassroom, particularly those that had been previously\nunwilling to speak up in class. They had gained the\ncourage to ask questions and to voice their opinions.\n\nStudents regarded peer tutoring as demanding, yet\nworth-doing. It is important that lecturers monitor\nprogress and meet regularly with students to provide\nsupport and to identify difficulties encountered. As\nsuggested by Goodlad and Hirst (1989), logistics in peer\ntutoring should be kept\nsimple to minimize the\ndifficulties students encounter, such as finding venues,\nallowing for timetable flexibility, and structuring of\ntutorial sessions.\n\nAs for the difficulties encountered by students, some\nthat related to personal characteristics would be difficult\nto address. However, it would be desirable if the tutees\ncould enter into a contract and be encouraged to take\nmore initiative and responsibility for their learning.\nThis, hopefully, would reduce the passivity encountered\nby the tutors in this study. Tutors\u2019 inadequate knowl-\nedge was a concern that warrants careful consideration\nin the planning of subsequent peer-tutoring activities.\nLecturers should make themselves available as resource\npersons for the tutors. Obviously though, students\nshould not be discouraged from finding their own\nanswers. A successful peer-tutoring program requires\ncareful planning, organization, and tutoring training.\n\nOwing to the lack of comparison groups in this study,\nit was difficult to determine the relationship between\npeer tutoring and gains in cognitive and personal\ndevelopment that were described by the participants in\nthe scheme. The self-reported changes in the students\u2019\nattitude and behaviors could also be explained by\n\n\fARTICLE IN PRESS\n\nA.Y. Loke, F.L.W. Chow / International Journal of Nursing Studies 44 (2007) 237\u2013244\n\n243\n\nHawthorne effects. It is inappropriate to make causal\ninferences from the reported changes in the students\u2019\nattitudes and behaviors during the peer-tutoring pro-\ngram. Generalization of the findings of this study to\nother settings and other populations is inappropriate\ndue to the use of a self-selected sample and the reliance\non the use of a self-reporting method of data collection.\nIt is recommended that further research includes control\ngroups or comparison groups, and addresses issues of\nachievement gain and objective outcome measures as\nwell as subjective participant feedback.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe present findings are very much in line with\nprevious research findings. Both tutors and tutees\nreported that they benefited from the experience. While\nthis qualitative study provided many insights into the\ngains and benefits that result from peer tutoring, it also\nreminded us of pitfalls that need further consideration\nand deliberation. It is evident that the use of the peer-\ntutoring program enhanced students\u2019\nlearning skills,\ncritical-thinking and problem-solving abilities, and\ncommunication skills, and that enabled them to gain a\nstronger motivation to learn and to gain a sense of\nresponsibility. Considering the benefits, it is suggested\nthat similar peer-tutoring programs be implemented in\nother courses within the university and that further,\nlarger scale, studies that examine the effects of peer\ntutoring be pursued.\n\nReferences\n\nAnderson, G., Boud, D., 1996.

An\nelectronic  search  was  conducted  among  English  journals  published  from  1960  to  November\n2012.  Databases  included  ERIC,  PsycINFO,  and  SPORTDiscus.  Fifteen  research  studies\nemploying  group-experimental  (Gersten  et  al.,  2005)  or  single-subject  designs  (Horner  et  al.,\n2005)  met  inclusion  criteria.  Each  study  was  assessed  for  the  presence  and  clarity  of  quality\nindicators.  Group  designs  met  an  average  of  62.5%  essential  and  69%  desirable  indicators.  An\naverage  of  80%  of  indicators  was  present  for  single-subject  designs.  Results  suggest  claims  of\npeer-tutoring  being  an  evidence-based  practice  are  premature.  Recommendations  for\nclarifying  and  applying  the  quality  indicators  are  offered.\n\n(cid:2)  2013  Elsevier  Ltd.

Introduction\n\nEvidence-based  practice  (EBP)  was  first  used  in  medicine  in  the  late  1900s  (Odom  et  al.,  2005)  and  was  defined  as\nintegrating  individual  clinical  expertise  with  the  best  available  evidence  from  systematic  research  (Balsor  et  al.,  2000).\nPresently,  EBP  has  been  proposed  in  many  areas  including  medicine  (Sackett,  1997),  rehabilitation  (Cicerone  et  al.,  2000),\n\n*  Corresponding  author.

Kalef  et  al.  /  Research  in  Developmental  Disabilities  34  (2013)  2514\u20132522 \n\n2515\n\nnursing  (Melnyk,  2010),  psychology  (Kratochwill  &  Shernoff,  2004),  and  education  (Pring  &  Thomas,  2004),  including\nadapted  physical  education  (Hutzler,  2011;  Bouffard,  &  Reid,  2012  and  Reid,  Bouffard,  and  MacDonald  (2012)).  An  emphasis\nhas  been  placed  on  delivering  services  based  on  the  best  possible  research  evidence  (Worrall,  2002).  In  accordance  with\npolicies  such  as  the  No  Child  Left  Behind  Act,  many  schools  presently  focus  on  improving  the  quality  of  education  by\nimplementing  teaching  practices  that  have  been  demonstrated  to  be  effective  by  scientific  evidence  (Odom  et  al.,  2005).\nPeer-tutoring  involves  one  student  enhancing  the  learning  of  another  (Ehly  &  Larsen,  1976).  Research  suggests  peer-tutoring\nhas  positive  effects  in  physical  education  for  students  with  a  disability  (Klavina,  2008;  Lieberman,  Newcomer,  McCubbin,  &\nDalrymple,  1997)  and  therefore  it  might  be  a  candidate  for  evidence-based  practice.\n\nIn  2003,  the  Council  for  Exceptional  Children\u2019s  Division  for  Research  established  a  task  force  to  assess  the  quality  of\nindividual  studies  in  special  education  and  to  identify  effective  practices.  In  the  2005  special  issue  of  Exceptional  Children\n(Odom  et  al.,  2005),  the  task  force  identified  four  types  of  research  methodologies  used  in  special  education;  experimental\ngroup  (Gersten  et  al.,  2005),  correlational  (Thompson,  Diamond,  McWilliam,  Snyder,  &  Snyder,  2005),  single-subject  (Horner\net  al.,  2005)  and  qualitative  designs  (Brantlinger,  Jimenez,  Klingner,  Pugach,  &  Richardson,  2005).  For  each  methodology,\nindicators  of  research  quality  were  presented  to  serve  as  standards  for  determining  the  strength  of  specific  studies.  In\ngeneral,  more  quality  indicators  were  assumed  to  be  associated  with  research  of  high  quality  and  therefore  practices  that\nmight  be  considered  evidence-based.  For  example,  providing  sufficient  detail  of  participants  for  replicable  precision  is  an\nindicator  for  single-subject  articles  (Horner  et  al.,  2005).  The  quality  indicators  were  developed  by  the  Task  Force  which\naimed  to  put  forth  clearly  stated,  understandable,  and  easily  accessible  guidelines  to  identify  high-quality  research  in  special\neducation  to  serve  researchers,  reviewers,  and  practitioners  who  determine  the  usability  of  findings  (Odom  et  al.,  2005).\nGersten  et  al.  (2005)  outlined  quality  indicators  for  group-experimental  and  quasi-experimental  research.  They  divided\nthe  quality  indicators  into  two  groups:  essential  for  quality  and  desirable  for  quality.  For  a  study  to  be  considered  \u2018\u2018acceptable\u2019\u2019\nit  must:  (a)  meet  all  but  one  of  the  essential  quality  indicators  and  (b)  at  least  one  of  the  desirable  quality  indicators.  For  a\nreport  to  be  considered  \u2018\u2018high  quality\u2019\u2019  it  must:  (a)  meet  all  but  one  of  the  essential  quality  indicators  and  (b)  at  least  four  of\nthe  desirable  quality  indicators.  Notably,  the  authors  provided  no  clear  rationale  of  those  criteria.  Essential  quality  indicators\nwere  arranged  into  four  groups,  coinciding  with  four  areas  of  a  group  experimental  research  report.  These  included  (a)\ndescribing  participants,  (b)  implementation  of  the  intervention  and  description  of  comparison  conditions,  (c)  outcome\nmeasures,  and  (d)  data  analysis  (Gersten  et  al.,  2005).  For  example,  one  of  the  quality  indicators  for  describing  participants\nconsiders  if  sufficient  information  was  provided  to  verify  the  participants\u2019  disabilities.\n\nHorner  et  al.  (2005)  presented  only  a  single  list  of  essential  quality  indicators  for  single-subject  research.  They  did  not\ndistinguish  between  essential  and  desirable  indicators.  Seven  broad  categories  were  proposed  for  single-subject  research:\n(a)  description  of  participants  and  settings,  (b)  dependent  variable,  (c)  independent  variable,  (d)  baseline,  (e)  experimental\ncontrol/internal  validity,  (f)  external  validity,  and  (g)  social  validity.  To  attain  a  replicable  status,  a  study  must  describe  an\nintervention  with  sufficient  clarity  so  that  it  may  be  duplicated.  The  current  study  aims  to  apply  the  aforementioned  quality\nindicators  for  group-experimental  and  single-subject  designs  within  the  peer-tutoring  literature  to  determine  if  this  popular\npractice  can  be  deemed  evidence-based.\n\n1.1.  Peer-tutoring\n\nPublic  Law  94-142,  the  Education  for  All  Handicapped  Children  Act  (1975),  later  renamed  the  Individuals  with  Disabilities\nEducation  Improvement  Act  (2004)  requires  students  with  a  disability  to  receive  physical  education.  Peer-tutoring,  also\nknown  as  peer-teaching,  is  one  of  the  instructional  models  that  can  be  considered  an  innovation  in  the  way  physical\neducation  subject  matter  is  taught  (Metzler,  2000)  and  might  be  particularly  beneficial  for  students  with  a  disability.  Peer-\ntutoring  can  be  categorized  as  peer-assisted  learning  and  includes  other  forms  such  as  class-wide  peer-tutoring  (Ward  &\nAyvazo,  2006)  and  peer-assessment  (Block,  Conatser,  Montgomery,  &  Flynn,  2001).  These  instructional  approaches  use\ntutors  to  directly  teach  their  peers,  with  minor  variations.  Class-wide  peer-tutoring  involves  the  class  working  in  reciprocal,\nrotating  roles  of  the  tutor  and  the  tutee  (Ward  &  Ayvazo,  2006),  whereas  peer-tutoring  occurs  when  students  are  arranged  in\nestablished  pairs  (Ward  &  Lee,  2005).  Peer  assessment  encompasses  either  method,  with  a  specific  focus  on  the  outcome  of\nstudents  assessing  others  (Ward  &  Lee,  2005).  In  physical  education,  it  is  argued  that  peer-tutoring  supports  the  inclusion  of\nstudents  with  a  disability  (Block  &  Obrusnikova,  2007),  provides  social  and  health  benefits  (Block  &  Oberweiser,  1995),  and\nenhances  student  learning  and  participation.  For  example,  Lieberman  et  al.  (1997)  found  that  peer-tutoring  can  help\nstudents  with  Down  syndrome  become  more  focused  and  involved.  Similarly,  Ward  and  Ayvazo  (2006)  determined  that\npeer-tutoring  facilitated  inclusion  of  students  with  autism  and  an  enabled  them  to  perform  an  increased  number  of  correct\nball  catches.  Peer-tutoring  has  been  used  among  students  with  varying  disabilities,  including  visual  impairments  (Wiskochil,\nLieberman,  Houston-Wilson,  &  Petersen,  2007),  autism  (Vansteenkiste,  Lens,  &  Deci,  2006),  and  Down  syndrome  (Lieberman\net  al.,  1997).  Several  studies  have  examined  the  effects  of  peer-tutoring  on  individuals  with  specific  disabilities  whereas\nothers  have  investigated  its  effects  on  individuals  with  general  disabilities  (Turlington,  2009)  or  severe  multiple  disabilities\n(Klavina  &  Block,  2008).  Peer-tutoring  has  been  a  popular  research  topic  in  adapted  physical  education  and  research  supports\nit  as  a  favorable  practice,  but  according  to  CEC  criteria,  is  the  research  evidence  of  sufficient  quality  to  claim  peer-tutoring  as\nan  evidence-based  practice?\n\nThe  current  research  will  assess  individual  studies  on  peer-tutoring  in  adapted  physical  education  using  the  quality\nindicators  presented  by  The  Council  for  Exceptional  Children\u2019s  Division  for  Research  task  force  in  2005  (Odom  et  al.,  2005).  It\n\n\f2516\n\nL.  Kalef  et  al.  /  Research  in  Developmental  Disabilities  34  (2013)  2514\u20132522\n\nwill  also  evaluate  the  clarity  and  ease  of  interpretation  of  the  quality  indicators  themselves  (Cook,  Tankersley,  &  Landrum,\n2009).  Do  they  highlight  all  the  necessary  areas  of  the  research  studies?  Are  all  indicators  clearly  identified  and  easy  to\ninterpret?  Thus,  the  purpose  of  the  current  research  is  to  assess  individual  studies  using  a  quality  indicator  analysis  to\nevaluate  the  effectiveness  of  peer-tutoring  in  adapted  physical  education.  The  clarity  of  the  quality  indicators  was  also\nevaluated  to  enhance  their  practicality.\n\n2.  Methods\n\n2.1.  Criteria  for  inclusion\n\n2.2.  Search  procedure\n\nStudies  selected  were  required  to  meet  several  inclusion  criteria.  First,  the  primary  purpose  of  the  study  was  to\ninvestigate  the  use  of  peer-tutoring  among  students  with  a  disability.  Second,  the  authors  had  to  specifically  state  that  the\nintervention  was  taking  place  in  physical  education  as  opposed  to  a  classroom.  Third,  the  study  adopted  a  single-subject  or\ngroup-experimental  design.  Fourth,  studies  were  published  in  peer-reviewed  journals  or  included  in  PhD  Dissertations  and\ntheses  between  1960  and  November  2012.  Finally,  all  studies  were  data-based  and  written  in  English.\n\nAn  electronic  search  was  conducted  among  peer-reviewed  English  language  journals  published  from  1960  to  November\n2012.  Databases  included  ERIC,  PsycINFO,  Health  &  Psychosocial  Instruments,  Current  Contents/All  Editions,  ProQuest\nDissertations  &  Theses:  Full  Text,  and  SPORTDiscus.  Specific  search  terms  included  \u2018\u2018physical  activity\u2019\u2019,  \u2018\u2018physical  education\u2019\u2019,\n\u2018\u2018exercise\u2019\u2019,  \u2018\u2018sport\u2019\u2019  and  \u2018\u2018recreation\u2019\u2019.  These  terms  were  used  in  conjunction  with  \u2018\u2018peer-tutoring\u2019\u2019,  \u2018\u2018class-wide  peer-tutoring\u2019\u2019,\nas  well  as  \u2018\u2018disability\u2019\u2019,  or  \u2018\u2018handicap\u2019\u2019.  To  search  for  relevant  studies  that  may  have  been  overlooked,  the  footnote  chasing\napproach  was  also  used  in  which  pertinent  studies  were  identified  in  the  reference  lists  of  the  articles.\n\n2.3.  Data  compiling  and  analysis\n\nFive  hundred  eighty-four  studies  were  identified  using  the  search  terms.  Notably,  over  500  of  these  studies  were  doctoral\ndissertations.  The  large  number  of  hits  was  likely  attributed  to  the  nature  of  the  search  in  Dissertations  &  Theses:  Full  Text.\nFor  instance,  articles  from  education,  as  opposed  to  physical  education  were  identified.  Only  fifteen  studies  met  the  inclusion\ncriteria.  Each  study  was  classified  as  single-subject  or  group  experimental  designs  according  to  the  definitions  provided  by\nthe  Exceptional  Children  task  force  in  2005  (Gersten  et  al.,  2005;  Horner  et  al.,  2005).  Each  study  was  assessed  using  the\nquality  indicator  analysis  identified  for  the  respective  research  method:  group  experimental  (Gersten  et  al.,  2005)  or  single-\nsubject  (Horner  et  al.,  2005).  For  group  design  articles,  a  distinction  between  acceptable  quality  and  high  quality  was  made\nby  Gersten  et  al.  (2005)  based  on  the  total  number  of  indicators  present.  No  such  distinction  was  presented  for  single-subject\ndesign,  however,  the  more  indicators  were  assumed  to  be  proportional  to  the  strength  of  the  claim  for  EBP  (Horner  et  al.,\n2005).\n\nTo  assess  the  individual  studies,  a  four-step  process  was  followed.  First,  the  authors  familiarized  themselves  with  the\nquality  indicators  and  posed  any  clarification  questions  they  had.  Second,  each  study  was  read  carefully.  Third,  the  studies\nwere  reviewed  a  second  time  to  examine  the  presence  of  the  quality  indicators.  Fourth,  quality  indicators  that  were\nconsidered  vague  were  identified  and  critiqued  individually  among  the  authors.\n\nAlmost  all  of  the  studies  involved  students  working  in  pairs,  with  peers  teaching  a  student  with  a  disability.  One  study\n(Ward  &  Ayvazo,  2006)  applied  class-wide  peer-tutoring  which  required  to  work  as  tutor-tutee,  but  in  small  groups.  Notably,\nonly  one  study  (Vivo,  2002)  reported  a  reciprocal  peer-teaching  style,  in  which  the  student  with  a  disability  also  taught  his/\nher  peer.\n\n2.4.  Inter-observer  agreement\n\nIn  addition  to  the  primary  author,  an  additional  author,  and  an  undergraduate  student  performed  coding  procedures  to\nobtain  an  indication  of  inter-observer  agreement.  All  observers  were  trained  to  reach  an  intra-observer  reliability  score  of  at\nleast  80%  prior  to  assessing  the  articles.  Then,  they  randomly  assessed  12  of  the  15  studies,  including  both  group  and  single-\nsubject  designs.  Intra-  and  inter-observer  agreements  were  assessed  using  percent  agreement.  The  number  of  agreements\nbetween  observers  were  summed  and  divided  by  the  number  of  agreements  plus  disagreements  between  observers,  and\nmultiplied  by  100.  The  average  inter-reliability  score  for  the  group  experimental  design  analysis  was  97%  and  for  single-\nsubject  designs  was  96%.

In  some  studies  the  two\nattrition  rate  indicators  were  not  applicable  making  the  number  of  desirable  indicators  10  rather  than  12.  The  total  number\nof  essential  quality  indicators  present  in  each  study  ranged  from  8/22  (36%)  to  20/22  (91%).  Only  one  study  (DeLuzio,  2009)\nwas  considered  acceptable  and  high  quality  according  to  the  criteria  described  by  Gersten  et  al.  (2005).  The  other  studies\nfailed  to  meet  criteria  to  be  considered  acceptable.\n\nTable  3  depicts  the  quality  indicators  present  in  the  10  single-subject  reports.  The  number  of  quality  indicators  ranged\nfrom  0%  (0/10)  to  100%  (19/10),  with  an  average  of  80%  (8/10).  As  seen  in  Table  3,  40%  (8/20)  of  the  quality  indicators  were\npresent  in  all  studies.  Several  quality  indicators  were  commonly  absent  and  some  were  more  frequent  than  others.  For\nexample,  quality  indicators  addressing  social  and  external  validity  were  present  in  every  study  while  only  three  of  the\nstudies  included  sufficient  information  in  regards  to  describing  the  setting  of  the  interventions  with  replicable  precision.\n\n\f2518\n\nL.

Some  quality\nindicators,  such  as  common  threats  to  internal  validity,  lacked  clarity  and  were  therefore  difficult  to  assess.\n\n4.  Discussion\n\nOnly  one  group-experimental  study  by  DeLuzio  (2009)  was  considered  acceptable  and  high  quality  according  to  the\ncriteria  described  by  Gersten  et  al.  (2005).  The  other  research  reports  failed  to  meet  criteria  to  be  considered  acceptable.\nEssential  indicators  for  describing  participants  and  the  interventionist/teacher  were  frequently  omitted  from  the  studies.\nAccording  the  Gersten  et  al.  (2005),  it  is  not  sufficient  to  merely  indicate  the  disability  when  describing  participants;  a\ndiagnosis  also  needs  to  be  documented.  For  example,  Turlington  (2009)  stated  that  students  had  severe  cognitive  disabilities,\nphysical  and  visual  impairments,  and/or  used  forms  of  mobility  assistance,  but  did  not  further  discuss  the  diagnoses  or  the\nspecifics  of  each  disability.  More  specific  information  such  as  indicating  an  individual  with  a  physical  disability  has  an\namputated  leg  would  enhance  replicability  of  the  study.  It  is  possible  the  specifics  of  the  disability  were  unavailable  to  the\nresearcher  or  unable  to  be  publically  documented  for  confidentiality  reasons.  More  detailed  descriptions  of  background  and\ncapabilities  of  the  individual  or  teacher  implementing  the  intervention  is  also  critical  for  replication  of  the  research.\n\nFour  of  five  group  design  articles  studies  failed  to  include  the  essential  indicator,  measurement  of  effect  size.  Although  the\ncalculation  was  usually  absent,  several  authors  indicated  that  a  small  sample  size  may  have  contributed  to  the  lack  of\nsignificant  findings.  For  example,  DePaepe  (1985)  stated  that  his  sample  size  was  too  limited  for  a  power  analysis,  but\nindicated  it  should  be  calculated  in  future  studies.\n\nThe  final  area  of  weakness  in  the  essential  group  design  quality  indicators  was  the  description  and  assessment  of  the  fidelity\nof  the  implementation.  Fidelity  is  critical  to  EBP  because  proper  implementation  of  an  intervention  might  increase  the\ngeneralizability  of  the  results  (Protheroe,  2009).  This  indicator  was  only  present  in  two  of  studies.  DeLuzio  (2009),  for\nexample,  addressed  fidelity  by  videotaping  the  peer-interactions  among  children  with  and  without  hearing  loss,  then\nanalyzed  quantity  and  quality  of  the  interactions.  Other  studies  involved  peer  tutor  training  to  ensure  the  research  was\ncarried  out  in  the  way  it  was  intended,  but  did  not  explicitly  assess  for  fidelity  (e.g.,  DePaepe,  1985).  Since  Horner  and\ncolleagues  did  not  provide  specific  measures  for  fidelity,  it  was  a  challenge  to  assess  and  was  identified  as  an  area  of\ndiscrepancy  among  raters.\n\nAttrition  rates  were  present  in  all  five  studies.  The  indicators  related  to  attrition  were  presented  in  more  general  terms\nthan  most  of  the  essential  indicators.  For  example,  the  first  indicator  asked  if  data  was  available  on  attrition  rates  among\nsamples  and,  therefore,  to  present  this  information,  explicit  documentation  and  description  of  attrition  rates  were\nunnecessary,  as  long  as  the  information  was  available.  In  review  of  the  five  articles,  there  was  a  range  of  observations  for  this\ncriteria;  some  explicitly  mentioned  attrition  (Halle  &  Gabler-Halle,  1989)  whereas  tables  of  results  were  consulted  in  other\nstudies.  For  example,  DeLuzio  (2009)  provides  tables  with  \u2018\u2018n\u2019\u2019  values  for  both  groups  that  are  consistent  with  the  initial\nnumber  of  participants,  showing  that  no  one  dropped  out  of  the  study.  Once  the  presence  of  this  indicator  was  established,\nthe  criteria  further  asked  if  severe  attrition  was  documented  and  if  so,  if  it  is  comparable  across  samples  and  if  it  is  less  than  30%.\nThese  last  two  indicators  were  only  relevant  in  one  article,  where  severe  attrition  was  presented  (Halle  &  Gabler-Halle,\n1989).  In  general,  the  presence  of  the  indicators  on  the  checklist  is  a  positive  attribution  of  the  associated  study,\ncorresponding  to  high  quality.  This  is  not  the  case  when  reporting  attrition,  as  indicating  severe  attrition  would  provide  less\neffective  results  and  negatively  influence  the  quality  of  the  paper.  Using  a  grading  scale  may  be  helpful  in  this  area  as  well,  in\norder  to  assess  quality.  It  may  be  true  that  a  study  is  higher  quality  if  there  is  explicit  documentation  of  attrition  information,\nas  opposed  to  the  information  just  being  available.  A  scale  would  also  incorporate  the  four  attrition  indicators  into  a\ncombined  criterion,  and  provide  a  positive  result  when  indicating  its  presence.  Alternatively,  four  indicators  may  be\nunnecessary  for  this  topic  and  reducing  to  one  or  two  at  most  may  be  more  effective.\n\nAll  five  articles  included  the  desirable  indicator,  presented  results  in  a  clear,  coherent  fashion,  which  might  not  be  surprising\nas  researchers  often  follow  strict  writing  guidelines  from  the  American  Psychological  Association  and  from  journal  editors  in\npreparation  for  publishing.\n\nThe  least  frequently  observed  desirable  indicators  relate  to  measurement  during  intervention;  data  collectors  blind  to  the\nstudy  conditions  and  equally  unfamiliar  to  examinees  across  conditions.  It  is  common  in  peer-tutoring  research  that  peer  tutors\nare  the  data  collectors  (e.g.,  Block  et  al.,  2001;  DePaepe,  1985),  or  the  researcher  (e.g.,  DeLuzio,  2009),  as  opposed  to  a  blind\ndata  collector.  A  data  collector  who  is  unaware  of  the  purposes  of  the  study  poses  some  challenge,  as  the  students  are  more\nlikely  to  perform  better  as  they  become  more  comfortable  with  an  individual  as  a  relationship  evolves.  Although  this  may\n\n\fTable 3\nNumber of quality indicators within single-subject research.\n\nQuality indicators\n\nDescriptions of participants and settings\n\nSufficient detail\nParticipant selection process described with replicable precision\nCritical features of physical setting described with replicable precision\n\nDependent variables\n\nDescribed with operational precision\nEach measured with procedure that generate quantifiable index\nValid measurement described with operational precision\nMeasured repeatedly over time\nData on reliability and inter-observer agreement associated with each\n\ndependent variable\n\nIndependent variable\n\nDescribed with replicable precision\nSystematically manipulated, under control of experimenter\nOvert measurement of fidelity of implementation\n\nBaseline\n\nBaseline conditions described with replicable precision\n\nExperimental control/internal validity\n\nAt least 3 demonstrations of experimental effects at 3 different times\nCommon threats to internal validity controlled\nResults document pattern that demonstrates experimental control\n\nExperimental effects replicated across participants, settings, materials,\n\nExternal validity\n\nto establish external validity\n\nSocial validity\n\nDependent variable is socially important\nMagnitude of change in dependent variable resulting from independent\n\nvariable is socially important\n\nIndependent variable implementation is practical and cost effective\nImplementation of independent variable over extended time periods, by\n\ntypical agents, in typical physical/social contexts\n\nX\nO\nO\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nO\nX\nO\n\nX\n\nX\nO\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nDonder and\nNietupski\n(1981)\n\nVivo\n(2002)\n\nHouston-Wilson\net al.

The  one  study  that  presented  measurements  beyond  an\nimmediate  post-test  had  a  group  design  study  that  looked  specifically  at  each  individual  in  the  group  over  a  period  of  13\nweeks  (Halle  &  Gabler-Halle,  1989).  The  presentation  of  the  measurements  provided  the  reader  with  more  concrete  evidence\nof  sustainability  of  each  individual  than  would  be  seen  with  only  pre-  and  post-testing.  This  difference  makes  it  clear  to  the\nreader  why  this  indicator  is  desirable  for  a  high  quality  paper,  yet  is  more  frequently  seen  in  single-subject  design  articles\nthat  follow  a  multiple  baseline  approach  (Horner  et  al.,  2005).  Evidence  of  criterion  and  construct  validity  also  provides  the\nreader  with  information  regarding  the  credibility  of  the  implementation,  which  is  important  for  replication.  But  such  validity\nwas  largely  absent,  with  only  DeLuzio  (2009)  addressing  the  constructs.\n\nThe  final  desirable  quality  indicator  missing  from  four  of  the  five  group-design  studies  was  inclusion  of  audio  or  video\nexcerpts,  which  are  meant  to  capture  the  nature  of  the  intervention.  In  the  studies,  it  was  common  to  use  videotaping  as  a\nform  of  data  collection,  yet  only  one  study,  which  was  a  thesis  with  appendices,  provided  excerpts  for  the  reader  (DeLuzio,\n2009).  While  documented  evidence  would  enhance  research  quality,  publishing  restrictions  such  as  page  limitations\nfrequently  prevent  researchers  from  including  this  information.  Perhaps  such  information  could  be  placed  in  digital  format\nat  a  site  associated  with  the  journal  or  the  author.  However,  there  may  also  be  restrictions  of  public  sharing  of  such  data  for\nethical  reasons  in  some  jurisdictions.\n\nTen  single-subject  studies  were  evaluated  using  the  criteria  outlined  by  Horner  et  al.  (2005).  Notably,  no  specific  number\nof  criteria  has  been  proposed  (Horner  et  al.,  2005),  to  deem  a  study  as  evidence-based.  Thus,  it  might  be  assumed  that  a\ngreater  number  of  quality  indicators  is  indicative  of  a  higher  quality  study.  The  average  number  of  indicators  present  in  the\n10  reviewed  articles  was  85%  (16.9/20).  Four  indicators  were  most  commonly  absent,  including  description  of  the  method  of\nselecting  participants,  description  of  setting,  baseline  described  with  replicable  precision,  and  controlling  for  internal  validity.\nExternal  validity  and  social  validity  were  present  in  all  studies.\n\nWhile  some  studies  described  the  participants  with  replicable  precision,  including  the  sampling  design  (Klavina  &  Block,\n2008),  several  described  only  who  was  selected,  as  opposed  to  how  they  were  selected  (e.g.,  Houston-Wilson,  Dunn,  Mars,  &\nMcCubbin,  1997).  Most  studies  incorporated  descriptions  of  the  participants\u2019  disability,  including  a  diagnosis,  which  was  less\nfrequently  present  in  the  group  designs.  Setting  descriptions  ranged  from  providing  general  details,  such  as  indicating  the\nresearch  took  place  in  physical  education  (e.g.,  Lieberman  et  al.,  1997),  but  few  provided  detailed  accounts  of  the\nenvironment  including  the  characteristics  of  the  facility  (but  see  Ward  &  Ayvazo,  2006  for  some  excellent  specific  examples).\nThe  studies  were  typically  conducted  in  schools,  therefore,  purposeful  rather  than  random  sampling  was  frequently  used.\nSince  the  indicators  describing  participants  and  settings  are  open  to  the  assessor\u2019s  interpretation,  perhaps  a  rubric  could  be\ncreated  and  implemented  to  assess  the  quality  of  each,  as  opposed  to  a  checklist.  A  detailed  rubric  would  provide  a  clear\nindication  of  study  quality  in  terms  of  meeting  insufficient,  sufficient,  or  exceptional  standards,  as  seen  in  recent  studies  that\nhave  assessed  quality  indicators  (Baker,  Chard,  Ketterlin-Geller,  Apichatabutra,  &  Doabler,  2009;  Chard,  Ketterlin-Geller,\nBaker,  Doabler,  &  Apichatabutra,  2009).\n\nThe  quality  indicator  controlled  for  common  threats  to  internal  validity  by  permitting  elimination  of  rival  hypotheses  was\nusually  absent.  Rival  hypotheses  were  commonly  discussed  in  the  studies;  however,  they  were  not  necessarily  controlled  to\npromote  validity.  For  example,  Lieberman,.  Dunn,  van  de  Mars,  and  McCubbin,  (2000)  described  measurement  effects  that\nmay  have  contributed  to  changes  in  student  activity  levels,  yet  did  not  control  for  them.  Understandably,  rival  hypotheses\nwill  be  presented  as  no  study  is  perfect.\n\nEvery  study \n\nincluded  the  quality \n\nindicators  external  validity  and  social  validity.  External  validity \n\nis  commonly\ndemonstrated  in  single-subject  designs  by  demonstrating  effects  using  multiple  participants  (e.g.  Vivo,  2002),  settings  (e.g.\nWebster,  1987),  materials  and/or  behaviors  (e.g.  Donder  &  Nietupski,  1981).  There  may  be  a  bias  involved  in  terms  of  the\nfrequency  of  the  social  validity  indicators.  The  evaluators  agreed  that  research  on  peer-tutoring  has  social  importance  as\neach  study  demonstrated  effective  intervention  strategies  that  are  feasible  and  easy  to  implement.  However,  since  there  is  no\nclear  definition  of  what  \u2018socially  important\u2019  means,  personal  bias  has  to  be  considered  when  evaluating  this  indicator.\n\nThe  present  research  has  some  limitations.  First,  the  research  was  limited  to  full-text  articles  only  and  foreign-language\nstudies  were  excluded.  Research  on  peer-tutoring  presented  at  conferences  was  also  excluded.  Inclusion  of  these  studies\nmay  have  affected  the  results.  Second,  although  every  effort  was  made  to  conduct  an  extensive  search  of  the  literature  using\nvarious  search  engines,  some  articles  might  have  been  missed.\n\nThis  study  might  serve  as  a  reminder  to  practitioners  to  embrace  empirically  based  practices  in  adapted  physical\neducation,  when  possible.  While  some  interventions  have  supporting  research  evidence  (e.g.  Sugden  &  Henderson,  2007)\nmany  are  guided  by  \u2018best  practices\u2019,  or  actions  that  have  the  authority  and  legitimacy  of  experienced  practitioners  or  simply\nabide  by  common  sense.  Practitioners  are  encouraged  to  use  empirical  evidence  in  addition  to  their  professional  skills,\ncompetence,  and  expertise  (Davies,  1999)  when  applying  interventions  such  as  peer-tutoring.\n\nResearchers  conducting  future  studies  should  make  efforts  to  meet  quality  indicators.  Much  attention  and  care  must  be\ngiven  to  research  design  given  that  many  criteria  rely  heavily  on  its  quality.  For  example,  an  essential  indicator  for  group\ndesigns  considers  the  appropriateness  of  the  data  techniques  and  their  link  to  key  research  questions  and  hypothesis.\nAccording  to  this  review,  some  indicators  can  be  met  rather  easily.  For  instance,  all  single-subject  studies  included  social  and\nexternal  validity.  Researchers  should  develop  studies  that  are  practical  and  include  a  sufficient  number  of  participants.  For\n\n\fL.  Kalef  et  al.  /  Research  in  Developmental  Disabilities  34  (2013)  2514\u20132522 \n\n2521\n\nthese  same  studies,  more  indicators  would  easily  have  been  met  if  researchers  simply  described  the  setting,  participants,  and\nbaseline  intervention  in  more  detail  to  warrant  replication.  While  it  is  recognized  that  these  indicators  will  be  met  with\nvarying  degrees  of  precision,  efforts  should  be  made  to  achieve  a  degree  of  methodological  rigor.\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nFifteen  studies  that  examined  the  effects  of  peer-tutoring  in  physical  education  were  divided  into  two  groups:  group\nexperimental  and  single-subject  designs.  Five  group-experimental  designs  and  10  single-subject  studies  were  evaluated\nindividually  using  the  quality  indicators  developed  for  their  respective  methodologies  (Gersten  et  al.,  2005;  Horner  et  al.,\n2005).  Only  one  group-experimental  study  by  DeLuzio  (2009)  was  considered  acceptable  and  high  quality  according  to  the\ncriteria  described  by  Gersten  et  al.  (2005).  The  other  studies  failed  to  meet  criteria  to  be  considered  acceptable.  None  of  the\nsingle-subject  designs  (Horner  et  al.,  2005)  provided  all  20  quality  indicators  but  overall  they  possessed  85%  of  the  indicators.\nIn  general  however,  both  the  group  and  single-subject  design  studies  showed  positive  effects  for  peer-tutoring.  In\nconclusion,  results  suggest  claims  of  peer-tutoring  for  students  with  a  disability  in  physical  education  being  an  EBP  are\npromising  but  premature  according  to  quality  indicators  presently  available.\n\nThe  quality  indicators  were  also  evaluated  for  clarity.  They  provide  a  systematic  way  to  evaluate  the  merits  of  research,\nbut  do  have  some  limitations.  Continued  testing  and  subsequent  revisions  of  the  quality  indicators  is  necessary,  as\ndifficulties  arose  in  understanding  indicator  definitions.  Several  recommendations  can  be  proposed  for  future  research.  First,\nwhereas  Gersten  and  colleagues  propose  specific  criteria  for  evaluating  high  versus  acceptable  quality  research  for  group\ndesigns,  Horner  and  colleagues  do  not  provide  such  criteria.  Rather,  it  must  be  assumed  that  a  greater  number  of  quality\nindicators  are  indicative  of  a  greater  quality  of  research,  but  at  what  level  of  quality  must  a  study  reach  to  claim  evidence-\nbased  practice.  It  might  be  beneficial  to  develop  more  specific  criteria  for  evaluating  research  reports,  perhaps  using  the\n\u2018essential\u2019  and  \u2018desirable\u2019  categories  similar  to  those  put  forth  by  Gersten  and  colleagues.  Presenting  such  criteria  would\nmake  the  quality  indicators  more  \u2018user  friendly\u2019  and  promote  consistency  for  evaluating  research  methodologies.  Second,\nseveral  of  the  group  and  single-subject  quality  indicators  (e.g.,  fidelity,  social  validity,  presented  results  in  a  clear  and  coherent\nmanner)  require  a  clearer  definition  of  their  exact  meaning.  For  example,  Gersten  et  al.  (2005)  did  not  provide  clarifications  of\nthe  quality  indicator  results  are  presented  in  a  clear  and  coherent  way,  therefore  it  is  suggested  that  when  the  indicators  are\nrevised,  this  one  is  given  a  precise  meaning  that  can  be  interpreted  in  one  way.  Similarly,  Horner  et  al.  (2005)  did  not  include\ncriteria  for  exactly  what  needs  to  be  measured  for  fidelity.  Is  there  a  minimum  level  of  fidelity  that  is  acceptable?  More\nspecific  details  as  to  how  it  should  be  evaluated  would  enhance  consistency  among  researchers.  Elimination  of  subjective\nterminology  within  descriptions  of  the  indicators  such  as  \u2018\u2018sufficient  detail\u2019\u2019,  and  \u2018\u2018critical  features\u2019\u2019  might  be  helpful  in\nclarifying  the  meaning  of  the  indicators.  Exemplars  of  each  quality  indicator  might  also  enhance  clarity.  Ultimately,\nobtaining  a  measure  of  inter-observer  reliability,  as  in  the  current  study,  is  important  in  determining  the  most  effective  way\nto  present  the  quality  indicators  to  researchers.  Third,  it  would  be  beneficial  to  produce  a  meta-analysis  reviewing  the  peer-\ntutoring  studies  to  compare  these  quantitative  results  with  a  quality  indicator  analysis.  Fourth,  investigators  should  address\nthe  applicability  of  the  quality  indicators  in  other  areas  of  research,  such  as  correlational  (Thompson  et  al.,  2005)  and\nqualitative  (Brantlinger  et  al.,  2005).  Finally,  with  specific  reference  to  adapted  physical  education,  more  research  should  be\nconducted  to  determine  other  practices  which  might  be  validated  as  evidence-based.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nReferences\n\nOur  thanks  to  Melanie  Kasner  for  assisting  with  the  reliability  analysis.\n\nBaker,  S.,  Chard,  D.,  Ketterlin-Geller,  L.,  Apichatabutra,  C.,  &  Doabler,  C.

Millera\n\naDepartment of Psychology, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada; bWindsor-Essex Catholic District School Board, Windsor, Ontario, Canada\n\nABSTRACT\nReading is typically considered a survival skill in our technology- and literacy-bound culture. Individuals\nwho struggle with learning to read are at significantly elevated risk for a number of negative outcomes,\nincluding school failure, under- and unemployment, and special education placement. Thus, those who do\nnot learn to read fluently will likely be a greater drain on society\u2019s resources. The authors examined the\neffects of a universal (school district-wide) implementation of a well-validated peer-tutoring reading\nintervention as a system-wide prevention measure in kindergarten through Grade 3 in a small\nmetropolitan area in Canada. Results suggest that nearly all children demonstrated improved reading\nfluency over time. Yet those at highest-risk for poor outcomes, including those living in poverty and those\nwho face learning challenges due to English as a second-language status or special education enrollment,\ndid not make parallel gains to same-age peers in more affluent schools. Implications for educational policy\nare discussed.\n\nARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 10 February 2015\nRevised 1 June 2015\nAccepted 8 June 2015\n\nKEYWORDS\nPeer tutoring; prevention;\nreading acquisition\n\na\n\n(PALS),\n\nReading instruction is a central goal in most educational set-\ntings and active programming to prevent reading failure is\nnearly universal. One well-regarded reading intervention is\nPeer-Assisted Learning Strategies\nclassroom\nprevention/intervention technique initially developed for\nelementary school students. PALS is a highly structured peer\ntutoring\u2013based reading intervention program that flexibly\npairs higher and lower functioning peers for decoding, flu-\nency, and comprehension activities. PALS is one of very few\nprograms to receive Best Practice status from the U.S.\nDepartment of Education Program Effectiveness Panel\n(McMaster, Fuchs, & Fuchs, 2006) but there are few studies\ndocumenting its effectiveness in Canadian schools. The\nmajority of the research with PALS has been conducted in\nthe Southeastern United States,\nlargely with teachers who\nwere directly or indirectly involved in the development\nand/or refinements of the program originally. To our knowl-\nedge, this study represents one of two studies of the imple-\nmentation of PALS in Canada. Although there are a number\nof similarities between American and Canadian educational\nenvironments, it cannot be assumed that all American pro-\ngrams will be similarly effective when implemented in Can-\nada. The other study documenting the implementation of\nPALS in Canada (Mattatall, 2011) is an as-of-yet unpub-\nlished dissertation completed at Queen\u2019s University. The\nresults from that study suggest that first-grade children in\na single Ontario school board (n D 436) learned to read at a\ngreater rate after the implementation of PALS than before.\nFurthermore, the best predictor of reading development was\nnot the demographic factors that have often been used as\n\nrisk indicators, but rather that poor letter-sound fluency\nand word identification fluency at the beginning of the year\npredicted slower, less proficient reading acquisition.\n\nInitially developed in collaboration with in-service teach-\ners as a prereferral intervention strategy (D. Fuchs & Fuchs,\n1998), PALS allows for the engaged participation of learners\nat diverse levels of reading achievement in the intervention.\nBecause it is highly manualized, teachers can reliably imple-\nment the program without significant time invested in pre-\nparing materials or activities. Results from previous efficacy\nstudies suggest that the majority (i.e., 80%) of children show\ngains from PALS with those children who do not make ade-\nquate progress over time are typically among the ranks of\nthe lowest performers prior to PALS (McMaster et al., 2006).\nYet, extant research suggests that all\nlevels of readers are\npositively affected by participation in the PALS program in\nGrade 1 (Mathes, Howard, Allen, & Fuchs, 1998). Improve-\nments have been noted in reading fluency, accuracy, and\ncomprehension (D. Fuchs, Fuchs, & Burish, 2000). Gains\nhave also been noted in social skills and self-confidence for\nlower performing students (D. Fuchs, Fuchs, Mathes, & Sim-\nmons, 1997). These secondary gains are particularly impor-\ntant,\neffective\nintervention for academic problems needs to include remedi-\nation of noncognitive skills, such as prosocial behaviors\n(Rothstein, 2004). Although highly effective and well devel-\noped, the PALS intervention is both time- and resource-\nintensive to implement, often with significant changes over\nmore whole-language focused curricula such as that which is\nendorsed by Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Education.

Thus, the Ontario\nlanguage curriculum for the early grades is heavily focused on\noral language development and the ability to gather informa-\ntion, but has been criticized for its lack of emphasis of direct\ninstruction on phonetics and decoding strategies.\n\nThe PALS intervention was developed to combine\ninstruction and more contextualized\nsystematic phonics\nreading experiences\n(Mathes, Howard, Allen, & Fuchs,\n1998). According to the developers (Fuchs, Fuchs, Mathes, &\nSimmons, 1997), the intention of PALS was to integrate pho-\nnetic knowledge with reading fluency and comprehension in\nthe context of classroom-based peer tutoring. The partnering\nof students was designed to help students take greater\nresponsibility for their learning while the teacher provides\nsupport as needed to the pairs. Pairs and assigned roles are\nflexible but there is always a coach and a reader. Each pair\nuses the PALS tutoring materials and procedures that are\ntaught by the teacher. The class is divided into two teams\nwith pairs earning points for their team through their coop-\nerative behavior and tutoring activities. Younger children\n(kindergarten and Grade 1) and struggling readers focus on\nbasic decoding and reading fluency, whereas older, more\nadvanced readers work on higher order reading skills, such\nas comprehension and making inferences. For example,\nbeginning readers practice the sounds the letters make, rec-\nognizing sight words, decoding phonetically regular words,\nand reading fluency. More advanced readers continue to\nacquire sight words, decode longer or more advanced words,\nand also work on reading comprehension by making and\nchecking predictions. The PALS program also includes a reg-\nular assessment component beyond the actual intervention\nactivities,\n(CBM).\ncalled curriculum-based measurement\nThese regular assessments by an adult provide the teacher\nwith information necessary to form coaching pairs and pro-\nvide feedback about each student\u2019s improvement over time.\nThese scores were also intended to allow teachers to monitor\nstudent progress and make instructional changes as needed.\nCBM assessments are in four domains (letter-sound fluency,\nword identification fluency, passage reading fluency, and\nmaze fluency) but domains are only administered as devel-\nopmentally appropriate. The PALS pairs are also re-arranged\nover time following ongoing assessments with CBM. PALS\nand CBM procedures have been well described in a number\nof studies (D. Fuchs & Fuchs, 1998; D. Fuchs et al., 2000;\nFuchs, Fuchs, Mathes, & Simmons, 1997; Mathes et al.,\n1998).\n\nThe goal with the present study was to document Grade 3\nstudents\u2019 progress through the PALS program. Furthermore,\nwe were interested in the implementation process and the effi-\ncacy of the intervention. We also split a subsample into schools\nwith excellent implementation, typical\nimplementation, and\nsignificant challenges to implementation to examine differences\nin progress with PALS. Last, we compared PALS progress with\nend-of-the-year provincial reading testing results.\n\nMethod\n\nPALS implementation\n\nWhen PALS was originally developed and implemented in the\nmid-1990s, researchers at Vanderbilt University and cooperat-\ning teachers in the surrounding school boards partnered to\ndevelop the interventions. Although several members of the\nresearch team had been classroom teachers in the past,\nthey relied on the classroom teachers to tell them if the inter-\nventions were acceptable and if they were effective from the\nteachers\u2019 perspectives. Adjustments were made in the program\nover time, reflecting both data-driven results and teacher expe-\nriences. The PALS program has been well validated by research\nas previously described.\n\nWith regard to the present\n\neducation teachers) would provide\n\nstudy, a school board\ndecided in 2007 to implement PALS. A consultant from the\nVanderbilt research group was hired to provide training\nand ongoing consultation for the implementation team. The\npilot stage involved eight schools (four PALS schools and\nfour control schools) and began in 2007. Early CBM results\nwere encouraging and full-scale implementation began in\n2008. As a result of limitations within negotiated teacher\ncontracts,\nit was decided that learning support specialists\nthe PALS\n(special\ninstruction to all students during teacher planning periods.\nThese specialists also conducted the CBM assessments. As\nof 2010, students as young as junior kindergarten (4 years\nold by December of the academic year) and through Grade\n3 are receiving the PALS program on a daily basis. Addi-\ntionally,\nthe program is also being used in small group\nwithdrawal support special education programs. PALS was\nused for reading instruction but students also received more\ncomprehensive language instruction beyond PALS from\ntheir classroom teachers, particularly in the areas of oral\nlanguage\nand\nmetacognitive strategies.\n\ncommunication, written communication,\n\nWith this implementation, PALS instructors used data\nfrom the CBM assessments and from provincially mandated\nassessments (PM benchmarks) to form the pairs, taking into\naccount interpersonal\nfactors within each classroom. The\npairing generally rank ordered the class and then divided it in\nhalf to form pairs starting at the top of the list. For example,\nin a class with 20 students, student ranked ordered one would\nbe paired with student rank ordered eleven and so on. The\nmore advanced student was the coach each tutoring session\nand the pairs were flexibly arranged following each CBM\nassessment. The tutoring portion of the program involved\nphonics-focused materials (Mathes et al., 1998) with develop-\nmentally sequenced decoding sounds/words, sight words\npractice, and oral reading practice at every session. Once stu-\ndents had progressed to the point of more contextual reading\npractice,\nreading materials\npurchased from a commercial book publisher that were\ndesigned to supplement classroom reading materials. These\nmaterials were designed to be within the reading range of\nthe lower reader but still somewhat challenging. With these\nbooks, coaches asked their partners to make predictions about\nwhat they were about to read aloud and then helped their\npartners check their predictions.\n\nprovided\n\nteachers\n\ngraded\n\n\fParticipants\n\nThe participants in this study were third-grade students across\nan entire school board in Southwestern Ontario in 2011\u20132012.\nThird-grade students were chosen because all third-grade stu-\ndents complete their first province-wide achievement testing,\nincluding reading, at the end of the academic year. Participants\nincluded 1,429 students across 38 elementary schools. Specific\ndemographic information for individual students was not avail-\nable, but the elementary school population in general for this\nschool board represents a racially diverse population. The\nschool populations were roughly evenly split between male and\nfemale students. Neighborhoods in school zones vary from\nimpoverished to affluent with most families at approximately\nmiddle class socio-economic status.\n\nMeasures\n\nCurriculum-based measurement\nAll kindergarten through Grade 3 students within the school\nboard began completing CBM eight times per year when PALS\nwas fully implemented. These CBM assessments were originally\ndeveloped as companion assessments for the PALS program\nand have well documented psychometric properties (L. S. Fuchs\n& Fuchs, 2002, 2004). The CBM assessments were intended to\nprovide ongoing feedback to teachers that they may use to\nmodifying their instruction for students. By Grade 3, students\nare completing passage reading fluency (PRF), which assesses\nthe student\u2019s reading fluency (speed and accuracy) for grade-\nlevel text passages over a 1-min period. The score is calculated\nby subtracting the number of words omitted or read incorrectly\nfrom the total number of words attempted within the time\nlimit.\n\nEducation Quality and Accountability Office assessments\n\nThe Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO)\nassessments are provincially mandated assessments that are\nfirst completed by students in Grade 3 (http://www.eqao.com/\nen/assessments/primary-division). According to information\non the EQAO website, these assessments are linked to the aca-\ndemic curriculum in Ontario (http://www.eqao.com/en/assess\nments/primarydivision/parents/Pages/parents.aspx).\nIn these\nassessments, students read short and longer texts with assess-\nment of the explicit and implicit information provided in the\ntexts. EQAO is group administered, and the questions are mul-\ntiple-choice responses in Grade 3. The texts for the reading\nassessments were chosen to represent information from across\nthe curriculum, including mathematics, the arts, health and sci-\nence, and the social sciences. Scores used were those reported\non a provincial website with the reported score reflecting the\npercentage of children for a given school at or above the man-\ndated level of achievement.\n\nData preparation\n\nPrior to conducting the main analyses, the data were assessed\nfor patterns of missingness and missing CBM data was subse-\nexpectation-maximization\nthe\nquently\n\nimputed\n\nusing\n\nTHE JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH\n\n173\n\nprocedure in SPSS. The overall rate of missing data was approx-\nimately 20% across the full dataset. Those students who were\nmissing more than 50% of their CBM scores were excluded\nfrom the analyses. CBM scores for individual students were\ncombined to calculate mean CBM scores for schools at each\nassessment point. The school mean CBM scores were used to\ncalculate slopes (representing the rate of change over time) for\neach school. These slopes were fairly normally distributed\n(M D 1.14; SD D 0.18; skewness D .046; kurtosis D \u2013.636). The\ndistribution is depicted in Figure 1.\n\nAnalyses\n\nTo answer the question of whether a school\u2019s implementation\nof PALS makes a difference in mean CBM rate of progress over\ntime, the schools were categorized into three groups based on\nthe challenges the schools faced in implementing the PALS\nproject over two academic years (2010\u20132011 and 2011\u20132012).\nUsing the expertise of the school board\u2019s lead psychologist who\nwas been integrally involved in the PALS implementation,\napproximately seven schools per category reflecting the best\nexamples of the categories were assigned. The exceptional\nimplementation schools were defined as those schools with sig-\nnificant resources (financial and human) to devote to program\nimplementation,\nfew environmental stressors, such as low\nsocioeconomic status in a large percentage of students, a rela-\ntively low rate of student transfers, and strong leadership for\nimplementation schools\nPALS implementation. The typical\nwere defined as those schools that are typical of schools in the\nregion, without the significant extra resources or significant\nextra challenges that were more common in the other groups.\nThe programming challenges schools were those schools that\nfaced significant problems, including issues such as a significant\npercentage of students living in poverty, high rates of student\ntransfers, and recent changes in school leadership. As a check\non these groupings, we also examined the percentage of stu-\ndents who were English as a second language learners (ESL)\nand the percentage of students with special needs in each\nschool. Although we did not detect a statistical difference\nbetween groups for percentage of students with special needs,\n\nFigure 1. CBM scores for 2011\u20132012 school year by implementation group.\n\n\fGrade 3 EQAO reading scores in 2011\u20132012 using correla-\ntions with post hoc analyses. For the third set of analyses,\nwe examined the effect of PALS on EQAO reading scores\nstarting in 2007\u20132008 and continuing until 2011\u20132012 with\nrepeated measures ANOVA by implementation group.\n\nResults\nFor the first set of analyses, we conducted a repeated-measures\nANOVA with mean school rate of progress on CBMs as the\nwithin-subjects factor and the implementation group as the\nbetween subjects factor to address whether or not a school\u2019s\nPALS implementation pattern makes a difference in CBM\nprogress over time. Although all three groups showed signifi-\ncant gains over time, the differences between the groups were\nnot statistically significant, F(2, 1427) D 1.55, p D .24, but there\nwas a medium-large effect size (partial h2 D .147) for this anal-\nysis. Thus, all schools showed significant improvement in CBM\nscores over time. A plot for the three groups over time is\ndepicted in Figure 1.\n\nFor the second set of analyses, we calculated the correlation\nbetween the slopes of the CBM score by school with each\nschool\u2019s EQAO 2011-2012 score. This correlation was not sig-\nnificant (r D \u00a1.05, p D .78). As a post hoc test, we calculated\nthe correlations of EQAO scores with first and last CBM\nprobes. Both of these correlations were highly significant (r D\n.67, p (cid:2) .0001 and r D .59, p (cid:2) .0001, respectively). Addition-\nally, we used multiple regression analysis to examine the pre-\ndictive value in using first and last CBM probes to predict\nEQAO scores. Together, first and last CBM probes account for\n40.9% of the variance (adjusted R2) in EQAO scores.\n\nFor the third set of analyses, we used repeated measures\nANOVA with implementation grouping as the between sub-\njects variable. The within subjects variable was Grade 3 EQAO\nscores from 2007 to 2012. The result of this analysis were also\nnot statistically significant (p D .72). Follow-up analyses\nrevealed that although the groups were clearly separated on\nEQAO reading scores over time and scores were highly corre-\nlated in proximal years (p < .01), the correlations more distally\nin time were modest as best. Furthermore, as depicted in\nFigure 2, the EQAO scores did not show a general improve-\nment over time for the full sample or within groups.\n\n174\n\nG. JONES ET AL.\n\nwe noted a medium to large effect (h2 D .124) for students with\nspecial needs. Although the cell sizes were too small to permit\nstatistical testing for individual group differences, examining\nthe means of the groups suggests that there were no real differ-\nences between the exceptional and typical groups (means of\n11.0% and 11.2%, respectively), but the programming chal-\nlenges group had a far greater percentage of their students with\nspecial needs (mean percentage of students receiving services D\n17.9%). No differences across groups were noted for percentage\nof ESL students, reflecting the high level of diversity in the com-\nmunity and within the school board. Overall, these results offer\nmodest support for the grouping strategy and Table 1 summa-\nrizes the main analyses.\n\nThe analyses were completed in three stages. For the first\nstage, the implementation groups were used to test whether\nan individual school\u2019s implementation predicted mean CBM\nrate of progress over time using a repeated measures analy-\nsis of variance (ANOVA). For the second set of analyses,\nwe tested the mean CBM rates of change as a predictor of\n\nTable 1.

EQAO scores by implementation group across time.\n\n\fDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we analyzed data from a local school board to\nassess the effects of an empirically validated reading interven-\ntion on the Grade 3 provincially mandated reading achieve-\nment test scores. Results indicated that the reading fluency of\nstudents, a well-validated predictor of long-term reading suc-\ncess (Ritchey, Silverman, Schatschneider, & Speece, 2013),\nimproves in the majority of students over time. Preliminary\nresults suggest that all children experience gains over time but\nthe group with the greatest challenges to implementation did\nnot catch up with students in other schools. In other words,\nthose who were at high risk for poor outcomes,\nincluding\nschool failure and premature drop-out (Ring, Barefoot, Avrit,\nBrown, & Black, 2013), likely need additional support beyond\nthe implementation of PALS.\n\nOther studies have demonstrated that children living in pov-\nerty and with other challenges are less likely to receive signifi-\ncant early literacy exposure (Pigott & Israel, 2005). This\npredicts poorer response to early reading instruction, even\nwhen that instruction is intensive (Pigott & Israel, 2005). The\ndata from our study suggest that these students continue to\nface challenges in the educational environment,\nincluding\npoorer reading achievement scores in the middle elementary\nschool years. It may also be that children living in poverty,\nespecially those with less exposure to literary-rich environ-\nments that are more common in affluent settings, may benefit\nmore from a more phonetically driven instructional method\nthat prioritizes decoding and other basic reading skills over\nmetacognitive skills. These results may also support calls for\npolicy changes at the early childhood instructional level for\nchildren to receive more intensive language and prereading\ninstruction prior to official school entry.\n\nOne facet of the study that was not easily testable but may be\nnotable to policy makers is the implementation of PALS in this\ncontext was very different from the implementation in the orig-\ninal Vanderbilt associated schools. In the case of the present\nstudy, classroom teachers did not provide the instruction for\nthe PALS procedures and specialists in learning (i.e., special\neducation teachers) were brought to the classroom for this\ninstruction. Thus, \u201cteacher buy-in\u201d may have been different\nfrom other contexts where PALS has been used. Future\nresearchers examining the efficacy of interventions like PALS\nmay benefit from including variables of teaching style and ori-\nentation, as well as integration of similar learning principles\nacross other parts of the school day.\n\nEQAO scores were not related to rate of progress on CBM,\nbut baseline and end-of-year CBM scores were highly corre-\nlated with EQAO. This is likely due to the improvements made\nin reading fluency across groups and schools (i.e., limited vari-\nability in rate of progress), which make it difficult to detect a\nsmall to medium effect. The effects for baseline and end-of-\nlikely reflect factors\nyear CBM scores, on the other hand,\nbeyond PALS implementation,\nincluding other risk factors,\nsuch as poverty and significant absences from school. These\nresults may also reflect extant concerns in the literature about\nthe utility of CBM testing beyond the beginning reading stage.\nFurthermore, EQAO scores likely tap into numerous other\nskills involved in reading comprehension, which may explain\n\nTHE JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH\n\n175\n\nthe null findings. The use of cross-curricular reading materials\nfor the EQAO assessments, as well as the testing format, might\nhave produced results akin to ours. Specifically, the EQAO test-\ning format (i.e., multiple-choice, scantron high-stakes group\ntesting) was likely novel to many of the third-grade students,\nwhich may have differentially impacted students across reading\nachievement levels.\n\nThe empirical literature base on reading fluency is unequiv-\nocal: Children with better reading fluency have better outcomes\non a number of factors, including improved reading compre-\nhension (Eason, Sabatini, Goldberg, Bruce, & Cutting, 2013),\nlower rates of special education placement (Denton et al.,\n2013), and higher high school graduation rates (Taylor,\nPearson, Peterson, & Rodriguez, 2005). It is clearly to the bene-\nfit of students and school systems if student receive early inter-\nvention to prevent poor reading fluency. Based on the results\nfrom our analyses, the majority of students across the school\nboard made tremendous gains in their reading fluency, even\nwhen there were multiple challenges in the implementation of\nthe intervention. Unfortunately due to small cell sizes (seven\nschools per group), we were not able to clearly assess the effect\nof challenges to the intervention. If one examines just the effect\nsizes, there is a moderate effect for implementation group. This\nsuggests that if we had more schools per group, we may have\nbeen able to detect a statistically significant difference.\n\nAlso notably, the CBM strategy that is attached to PALS is\neffective as a predictor of EQAO performance. Schools whose\nCBM scores reflect students with poorer reading fluency at\nthe beginning of the year and at the end of the year will have\nthe lowest scores on EQAO. This may suggest that these\nstudents need a more targeted intervention or enhanced serv-\nices in order for their reading performance to improve. The\ndevelopers of the PALS program have noted that the lowest\nperforming students in any environment are unlikely to experi-\nence excellent improvement following the PALS intervention\nand will probably need additional assistance (D. Fuchs, Comp-\nton, Fuchs, Bryant, & Davis, 2008). It is likely that these data\nreflect this scenario. These data also have a good news element:\nbecause all students improve at a steadily similar rate within\nthe PALS intervention, it is clear that all students are benefiting\nfrom this relatively time- and cost-intensive intervention.\n\nRegardless of the positive outcomes associated with the PALS\nintervention, this study was not without limitations. First of all,\nwe did not find the significant outcomes that we hypothesized in\nall cases. Part of this is the inherent limitation in using provin-\ncially mandated testing as an outcome. These tests are group-\nadministered and the reading tests actually assess the ability to\ncomprehend content across a number of content domains as\nwell as requiring significant test-taking skills on the part of stu-\ndents. The modest correlations of the EQAO scores over time\nwithout significant changes in student populations are indicators\nof the problems associated with this kind of testing. Although\nour grouping variable may be judged as problematic, we were\nlimited by the available data. Yet, data reflecting socioeconomic\nstatus of the cachement areas for the schools partially validates\nour strategy. Future researchers may benefit from a more inde-\npendently derived grouping variable. Last, these results represent\nthe experiences of one school district in Southwestern Ontario\n(Canada). As a result, the results may not generalize to other\n\n\f176\n\nG. JONES ET AL.\n\ndistricts, particularly those that are significantly more rural or\nwith different risk factors for reading failure.\n\nThe use of CBM as an intervention monitoring system has\nalso been criticized by some researchers. Although there are a\nsmall handful of studies suggesting that CBM should robustly\npredict performance on group high-stakes testing such as\nEQAO (e.g., Schmitt, Balles, & Venesky, 2013), this assessment\nmethod is not without flaws. There are several studies suggest-\ning that students who are English-as-a-second-language learn-\ners or who are receiving special education services (Reschley,\nBusch, Betts, Deno, & Long, 2009; Yeo, 2010) may not demon-\nstrate the same highly predictive relations between CBM and\nhigh-stakes testing performance. A more recent study also\nreported that the relations between CBM performance and\nend-of-year testing are attenuated in lower achieving readings\n(Kilgus, Methe, Maggin, & Tomasula, 2014). The emphasis on\nspeeded performance (fluency) in the CBM assessments also\ndid not address comprehension or the ability to apply informa-\ntion learned through reading. Likewise, research in a more\nbehaviorally focused paradigm has criticized CBM for not con-\nsidering the source of errors during reading and the poor con-\ntrol (nonequivalence) of passage reading difficulty (Ardoin,\nRoof, Klubnick, & Carfolite, 2008). Furthermore, studies that\nhave included measures of reading attitudes as well as CBM\ndata in predicting end-of-year reading achievement have\nreported significant effects for reading attitudes (e.g., Martinez,\nAricak, & Jewell, 2008). Thus, although there is significant sup-\nport for the use of CBM, particular in the context of the PALS\nprogram, this strategy has also received significant critical\nattention. In the case of this particular study, there may have\nbeen stronger results if lower performing students had also\nreceived more instruction to promote oral language develop-\nment or more exposure to global knowledge.\n\nIn summary, our results indicate that PALS is an effective\nintervention, even when delivered in a very different context\nthan in which it was developed. Across the school board in\nwhich PALS was implemented, students experienced improve-\nments in their reading fluency. Although the intervention\nrequired significant re-allocations of time and human resour-\nces, students clearly benefited. As school boards consider how\nto deliver elementary school instruction in light of ongoing\nconcerns about budgeting and Ministry of Education curricula,\nit is critical that the learning needs of students be considered.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors wish to thank the reviewers for their helpful comments\non the original draft of this manuscript.

On one hand, the student body is itself becoming more diverse in age, expe-\nrience level, motivation, and learning need (Brown and Kysilka 2002; Carter and McNeill\n1998; Odell et al. 2003); on the other hand, institutions are facing growing resources\nconstrains (Salerno 2005) rapid technological advancements, demographic changes, and a\ngrowing demand for accessibility and equity (Whitt et al. 2008). Along this process,\ncolleges and universities have been called upon to address these challenges by focusing\nmore intentionally and systematically on undergraduate programs in terms of student\nretention and academic outcomes (Arco et al. 2005; Wolf-wendel et al. 2009).\n\nRegarding student retention, despite some difficulties in making comparisons across\ncountries, given the fact that each country defines and calculates such rates in particular\nways, there exists some useful information on degree completion rates for the year 2003\n(the number of degrees completed per 100 students enrolled). The following countries have\nthese completion rates (Davies 2006; Instituto de Evaluacio \u0301n 2009; Van Stolk et al. 2007):\nJapan 26%, the United Kingdom 24%, Australia 23%, Denmark 23%, Ireland 21%, France\n20%, Korea 18%, Sweden 18%, United States 17%, and Spain 17%.\n\nIn Spain, there are 77 institutions of higher education (50 public and 27 private). About\n84% of the students access the university through a national exam. In the last 20 years,\nstudent enrollments have multiplied threefold, and faculty and staff have grown at a similar\nrate. Furthermore, the number of graduates has grown up to 77% during this period of time.\nDuring the academic year 2008\u20132009, a total of 1,504,276 students were registered in higher\neducation (including 1,358,875 undergraduate students, 49,799 master\u2019s students and 77,249\nPh.D. students). The University of Granada (UGR), particularly, is a public university\nlocated in the city of Granada, in southern part of Spain. It is one of the five largest research\nuniversities in the country, offering more than 70% of the academic specializations and\nofficial degrees offered in the country (Ministerio de Educacio \u0301n 2009). In 2008\u20132009, it had\nabout 56,000 undergraduate and 30,000 postgraduate registered students.\n\nStudies on the quality of the Spanish higher education show a low productivity level,\nespecially among freshmen students (Consejo de Coordinacio \u0301n Universitaria 2002). While\nthe number freshmen students within this system is quite high, the percentage of dropouts\nreaches 26%; moreover, while 48% of university students do repeat course, at one point or\nanother in their program of study, only 26% of the students finish their studies in due time\n(Consejo de Coordinacio \u0301n Universitaria 2002; Gutie \u0301rrez 2002; Pozo 2000; Rodr\u0131 \u0301guez\n2004). In consequence, the average duration of university programs for a great number of\nstudents is almost half over the institutionally pre-established time. Interestingly enough, in\ntechnical programs, 30% of the students repeat the first year, while the percentage of\nstudents who take final exams at the end of the course falls below 30% (Consejo de\nCoordinacio \u0301n Universitaria 2002). Among the factors that may contribute to this situation\nare (a) that lecturing in large classroom halls is the predominant teaching style\u2014a style\nthat does not provide ample opportunities for student participation; (b) that class atten-\ndance is not required in order to take exams or pass the class; and (c) that professors\u2019 spend\noffice hours mainly doing grade revisions after exams (Consejo de Coordinacio \u0301n\nUniversitaria 2002). Other contextual factors affecting students\u2019 engagement and persis-\ntence during their university studies have to do with the way in which the institution\nallocates its resources and organizes both services and learning opportunities to encourage\nstudents to participate in, and benefit from, Academic and Student Affairs programs\n(Kuh 1996; Pascarella and Terenzini 2005).\n\n123\n\n\fHigh Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788\n\n775\n\nIf, to all this, one adds the great variability in the profiles of students entering the\nUniversity (Brown and Kysilka 2002; Carter and McNeill 1998; Guardia 2000; Odell et al.\n2003) and the fact that 60% of the drop-outs take place during the first academic year, it is\neasy to see that something needs to be done in order to reverse the situation (Consejo de\nCoordinacio \u0301n Universitaria 2002). Needless to say, such low levels of retention and per-\nformance, besides having a high economic and social cost and causing considerable levels\nof frustration among students and university faculty and administrators, significantly and\nnegatively affect the quality of teaching (Ferna \u0301ndez et al. 2010). This is why so many\nauthors have devoted a great deal of effort to developing models, activities and programs\nthat may prevent academic failure (Bean 1990; Carter and McNeill 1998; Clark 2005;\nLee et al. 2009; Mart\u0131 \u0301n et al. 2004; Murtaugh et al. 1999; Pascarella and Terenzini 2005;\nPozo 2000; Ryan and Glenn 2003; Rodr\u0131 \u0301guez 2004; Tinto 1993). Established theories and\nconstructs long associated with student success (including involvement, engagement, and\nintegration) have effectively guided educational practice for decades; but, most recently,\nresearch studies advocate for researchers and policy makers to be critical of the traditional\ntheories of student retention and to pose new questions related to how students participate\nin college and to which extent current theories account for diverse learners (Wolf-wendel\net al. 2009). This is particularly important, considering the growing cultural diversity of the\nstudent body and the relatively low effectiveness of the most widely-cited theories for\nexplaining the drop-out phenomenon among college students (Guiffrida 2006).\n\nAl the local level, the evaluation reports undertaken by the UGR also reflect the need to\nintroduce some useful institutional measures so as to increase student retention and success\n(Arco-Tirado and Ferna \u0301ndez-Balboa 2003). So far, two types of institutional answers have\nbeen developed: (a) Academic and Student Affairs programs offering help and support to\nnew students so as to facilitate their integration into the new social and academic envi-\nronment and (b) programs designed to increase and enhance the psycho-pedagogical skills\nof the professoriate. The Peer Tutoring Program (PTP) studied in the present study is one\nof the programs in the first category. More concretely, the PTP is a program of psycho-\npedagogical intervention based on peer tutoring sessions whereby older, more experienced\nstudents (seniors, Master\u2019s) undergo a tutoring training seminar taught by the UGR\u2019s\nprofessional staff (Dura \u0301n and Vidal 2004; Topping 1996). The PTP draws upon counseling\napproaches and seeks to enable students to know, understand, and decide how to spend\ntime on task, engage in quality effort, and participate more actively in learning. All this\nseems to foster greater student autonomy and involvement. Although such an approach has\nhad a long-standing tradition in secondary schooling (e.g., Dura \u0301n and Vidal 2004; Kuh\n2009; Robinson et al. 2005; Rohrbeck et al. 2003; Tindall 1995; Topping and Ehly 1998),\nit has been occasionally applied at the university level for preventive purposes, as well. In\nthis vein, several studies and reports (e.g., Benavent and Fossati 1990; Blowers et al. 2003;\nFerna \u0301ndez et al. 2003; Fresko 1997; Griffin and Griffin 1997; Griffiths et al. 1995; Higgins\n2004; Kuresman 2008; Lake 1999; Mynard and Almarzouqi 2006; Nestel and Kidd 2003;\nQuintrell and Westwood 1994; Topping 1996; Tuckman 2003; Warwick and Holton 2001;\nXu et al. 2001) show that, by trusting that students are in the best position to identify their\nown induction needs (Carter and McNeill 1998), these programs tend to achieve high\nlevels of efficacy and efficiency in addressing diverse problems, such as academic failure,\ncognitive and metacognitive strategies deficit, and difficulties in social\nintegration\n(Topping 1996, 2005). Little is known, however, about the effects of these programs upon\nthe tutors, with the exception of some data on personal satisfaction, which, in general,\nachieves quite high scores (Topping 1996).\n\n123\n\n\f776\n\nHigh Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788\n\nTo both ends, the following hypotheses were established:\n\nHypothesis 1 As a result of the PTP, there will be a statistically significant improvement\nin the freshmen treatment group\u2019s Grade Point Average (GPA), reflected in the Academic\nReport, as compared to that of the freshmen control group.\n\nHypothesis 2 As a result of the PTP, there will be a statistically significant improvement\nin the freshmen treatment group\u2019s Performance Rate (PR) (i.e., the coefficient of the\nnumber of credits passed divided by the number of credits registered), reflected in the\nAcademic Report, as compared to that of the control group.\n\nHypothesis 3 As a result of the PTP, there will be a statistically significant improvement\nin the freshmen treatment group\u2019s Success Rate (SR) (i.e., the coefficient of the number of\ncredits passed divided by the number of credits examined), reflected in the Academic\nReport, as compared to that of the freshmen control group.\n\nHypothesis 4 As a result of the PTP, there will be a statistically significant improvement\nin the freshmen treatment group\u2019s cognitive and metacognitive strategies (measured by the\nPozar\u2019s Study habits inventory, 2002), as compared to those of the freshmen control group.\n\nHypothesis 5 As a result of the PTP, there will be a statistically significant pre- and post-\ntest difference within the freshmen treatment group\u2019s cognitive and metacognitive strat-\negies, as measured by the Pozar\u2019s Study habits inventory (2002).\n\nHypothesis 6 As a result of the PTP, there will be a statistically significant difference in\nthe cognitive and metacognitive strategies of the tutors\u2019 group, as measured by Pozar\u2019s\nStudy habits inventory (2002).\n\nHypothesis 7 As a result of the PTP, there will be a statistically significant difference in\nthe social skills of the tutors\u2019 group, as measured by Gismero\u2019 Social skills scale (2000).\n\nMethod\n\nParticipants\n\nThe sample of this study consisted of 141 students from the UGR. They were distributed in\ntwo sub-samples: One hundred freshmen and forty-one tutors. As for the freshmen, half of\nthem were randomly assigned to the treatment group while the other half conformed the\ncontrol group. Within the treatment group, twenty freshmen studied Civil Engineering,\neleven studied Pharmacy, ten studied Economics, and nine studied Chemical Engineering.\nFurthermore, twenty-six were female and twenty-four were male. Their average age was of\n17.9 years (range = 17\u201319). The control group had an equivalent distribution to that of the\ncontrol group in terms of degree, gender, and age. The tutors\u2019 group was composed of\nstudents either in last 2 years of their degree program or already in a postgraduate (doc-\ntoral) program. Sixteen of them studied Civil Engineering, nine studied Pharmacy, seven\nstudied Economics, and nine studied Chemical Engineering. Among them, fifteen were\nfemale and twenty-six were male. The average age was 23.9 years (range = 21\u201329).\n\nThe Pozar\u2019s Study Habits Inventory (2002), consisting of 90 multiple-choice items,\ngrouped into 5 scales (i.e., contextual conditions of study, study planning, use of study\n\nMaterials and instruments\n\n123\n\n\fHigh Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788\n\n777\n\nmaterials, learning of study content, and honesty), was completed by the participants.\nThe use of this inventory is justified not only because of the need to measure these\ncognitive and metacognitive strategies or \u2018\u2018study skills\u2019\u2019 (Tuckman 2003) in higher edu-\ncation students, but also because of the fact that there are no other standardized instruments\nwith its psychometric properties in Spanish. Its reliability index (two-halves model) is\nhigher than .91, its internal validity indexes were (a) between .73 and .86, in the correlation\ncoefficient between direct scores in the inventory\u2019s scales and the scores given by pro-\nfessors, and (b) higher than .72 in the correlation coefficients among the inventory\u2019s scales.\nAll participants also completed the Study Habits Inventory (Pozar 2002).\n\nA Social Skills Scale (Gismero 2000), composed of 33 multiple-choice items, grouped in\n6 sub-scales (i.e., self-expression in social situations, defense of own interests as a con-\nsumer, expression of discomfort and annoyance, ability of saying \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 and cutting off\ninteractions, ability to make requests, and ability to initiate positive interactions with the\nopposite sex), was also completed by both the freshmen and the tutors. This scale is\ncommonly used to evaluate social skills in adolescents and adults due to its high reliability\nindex (Cronbach alpha .89) and the acceptable validity indexes of .53 (in the correlation\ncoefficient between the overall direct punctuation in the scale and the overall self-\ndescriptors) and between -.84 for aggressiveness and .84 for assertiveness (in the corre-\nlation coefficient with adjectives). The Social Skills Scale (2000) was completed by the\ntutors only.\n\nThe Academic Report was additionally used to calculate the freshmen\u2019s GPA,\n\nPR, and SR.\n\nDesigns and procedures\n\nThe number of hypotheses of this study required diverse methodological designs (see Ato\n1995; Campbell and Stanley 1963). For hypotheses 1, 2, and 3, a static-group comparison\ndesign was used, hypotheses 4 and 5 required a pretest\u2013posttest control group design,\nwhereas hypotheses 6 and 7 called for a one-group pretest\u2013posttest design.\n\nThe sampling selection was based on a non-probabilistic sampling technique called\n\u2018\u2018purposeful sampling\u2019\u2019 (Mart\u0131 \u0301nez 1995). This technique consists of four sampling stages.\nIn the first stage (i.e., selecting the field of study), the UGR was chosen as the field of study\ndue to the fact that it was wherein the PTP was located. In the second stage (i.e., inviting\nparticipation), the deans of the four UGR degree programs with the lower rates of aca-\ndemic success were asked permission to allow the students in their respective colleges to\nparticipate in the PTP and, by extension, in the present study. In the third stage (i.e.,\ntentative sampling), the investigators gave oral presentations and provided written mate-\nrials about the purposes, processes, and requirements of the PTP to nine groups of doctoral\nand senior students and to ten groups of freshmen. After the presentations, the researchers\nsolicited students\u2019 participation in both the PTP and the study. Forty-five doctoral and\nsenior students and 197 freshmen agreed to participate both in the PTP and the study. As\nsuch, these volunteers (i.e., the tutors and the freshmen) were asked to (a) sign a \u2018\u2018contract\nagreement\u2019\u2019 (Ferna \u0301ndez et al. 2003) containing 14 clauses and one agreement section and\ndetailing the rights and obligations of the participants in the PTP; (b) fill out a Self-\nEvaluation Report (Ferna \u0301ndez et al. 2003) consisting of 22 open-ended items and 12\nmultiple-choice items grouped in 3 areas (i.e., demographic information, academic\ninformation, and areas-of-interest information); (c) complete the Study Habits Inventory\n(Pozar 2002); (d) fill out the Social Skills Scale (Gismero 2000); and (e) provide copies of\ntheir Academic Report.\n\n123\n\n\f778\n\nHigh Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788\n\nIn the fourth stage (i.e., definite sampling), a final selection process was undertaken. Of\nthe 45 doctoral and senior students with initially volunteered, 41 were selected as tutors\naccording to the following criteria: (a) having a GPA higher than 1.5 (in a scale from 0 to\n4), (b) having an enneatype whose score was higher than 4 points on each one of the scales\nof the Pozar\u2019s Study habits inventory (2002), (c) scoring 25 points or higher in 4 of the\nsubscales and the overall direct score on Gismero\u2019s Social skills scale (2000), (d) having\npositive scores on the rest of the areas of the Self-evaluation reports (Ferna \u0301ndez et al.\n2003), (e) attending the four PTP training sessions, and (f) passing the practical PTP\ntraining tests.\n\nConcerning the 197 freshmen who initially volunteered, 110 were finally selected and\npaired up according to equivalences in three sets of variables (Brooks and DuBois 1995;\nCorominas 2001; Harackiewicz et al. 2008; Leppel 2002; Murtaugh et al. 1999; Pascarella\nand Terenzini 2005; Pozo 2000; Rodr\u0131 \u0301guez 2004; Tinto 1993; Tuckman 2003; Valle 1996):\n(a) demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, nationality); (b) academic variables (e.g.,\ndegree program, program year, schedule); and (c) other variables associated with academic\nsuccess or failure (e.g., cognitive and metacognitive strategies, level of commitment). The\nremaining 87 students were discarded due to the lack of an appropriate match.\n\nFurthermore, 5 of the 55 initial pairs of freshmen were discarded due to the lack of\navailable tutors (of the 41 tutors, nine agreed to tutor two freshmen). As such, the final\nfreshmen group was composed of 50 pairs. Once the pairs were established, each member\nof each pair was randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group.\nParametric and non-parametric analyses did not reveal significant statistical differences\nbetween the groups, thus establishing their equivalence. Finally, the matching of the\nfreshmen in the treatment group with their respective tutor was done according to simi-\nlarities in the program of study, schedules, and nationality (Ato 1995; Dura \u0301n and Vidal\n2004).\n\nAs mentioned above, the tutors had to undergo a four-session seminar (see Dura \u0301n and\nVidal 2004; Tindall 1995). Session 1 provided an introduction and a justification of the\nPTP and instructed tutors and tutees in the use of the Program Manual (a tool used to reflect\nupon the development and the content of the tutoring sessions, as well as on other aspects\nof the PTP; see Buela and Sa \u0301nchez 2002; Caballo 1993; Gargallo 2000; Kee 2002; Zarcone\n2000). The usefulness of the use of the Program Manual was ascertained in a previous pilot\nstudy (Ferna \u0301ndez et al. 2003). This first session also provided the ground for the devel-\nopment of the first tutoring session and the evaluation of the freshmen\u2019s needs. Session 2\naddressed sleeping habits (Zarcone 2000), eating habits (following the recommendations of\nthe Sociedad Espan \u0303ola de Nutricio \u0301n Ba \u0301sica y Aplicada 2004), and intellectual work habits\n(e.g., self-regulation, goal setting, time management) (Gargallo 2000). Session 3 focused\non strategies for classroom note-taking and assignment completion) and intellectual work\ntechniques (e.g., strategies for accessing information databases, organizing, and exam\npreparation) (Gargallo 2000). Session 4 tackled basic social skills (Caballo 1993).\n\nThe PTP process for the freshmen consisted of a ninety-minute session, once a week, for\n10 weeks spread over the first semester of the academic year. The meeting dates, time, and\nplace had been previously concerted between the freshmen and their respective tutor. The\ntutoring method was mainly based on direct instruction and guided discovery. In the first\nsession, tutor and tutee were introduced to one another, exchanged contact telephone\nnumbers and e-mail addresses, discussed the implication of the PTP (including their\nrespective rights and obligations), and elaborated an academic plan (including assignments\nfor the tutee). In the second session, the tutee\u2019s previous assignments were revised, and the\nneeds of the tutee were evaluated so as to determine areas of intervention. As such, healthy\n\n123\n\n\fHigh Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788\n\n779\n\nsleeping habits and study habits, conditions and skills (e.g., goal setting, time management,\nand self-assessment) were addressed, in view of which, new goals and assignments were\nestablished. In the third session, the previous assignments were analyzed and the academic\nplan was adjusted (when necessary).

The fifth session served to evaluate all that had\nhappened to that point. Afterward, the emphasis was put on reinforcing and re-examining\nthe cognitive and metacognitive strategies and the decision-making processes of the tutees.\n\nData analysis\n\nThe data for hypotheses 1 (re: Freshmen\u2019s GPA), 2 (re: Freshmen\u2019s PR), and 3 (re:\nFreshmen\u2019s SR) were analyzed through the U of Mann-Whiney and value d of Cohen\ntechniques. The data for Hypothesis 4 (re: Freshmen\u2019s intergroup cognitive and metacog-\nnitive strategies) were analyzed through a discriminant function analysis and an ANOVA,\nsince the assumptions for using parametric test were met in both cases (Kolmogorov\u2013\nSmirnov to check for normal distribution and the Levene Test to calculate the variance\nequality for the independent means). The data for Hypothesis 5 (re: Freshmen\u2019s intragroup\ncognitive and metacognitive strategies), 6 (re: Tutors\u2019 cognitive and metacognitive strate-\ngies), and 7 (re: Tutors\u2019 social skills) were analyzed through the t-student dependent test,\nboth after applying Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov to check for normal distribution.\n\nResults\n\nPertaining to hypotheses 1, 2, and 3, the respective U of Mann\u2013Whitney analyses for the\nfreshmen treatment group on GPA, PR, and SR did not yield statistically significant\ndifferences at the end of the PTP, as compared to the results obtained by the freshmen\ncontrol group (Table 1).\n\nAs to Hypothesis 4, the results obtained after comparing the means of the freshmen\u2019s\ntreatment and control groups in the post-test showed that the variable \u2018\u2018group\u2019\u2019 (i.e.,\ntreatment vs. control) yielded a statistically significant amount of variance (Lamda de\nWilks = .83, p \\ .000). Using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov, it was ascertained that there was\na normal distribution on both the pre-test and the post-test scores on the four Pozar\u2019s Study\nhabits inventory (2002) scales on cognitive and metacognitive strategies. Moreover, the\n\nTable 1 Intergroup (Treatment\nvs. Control) comparisons\nof freshmen\u2019s GPA, PR,\nand SR at the end of the PTP\n\nMean\n\nSD\n\nd\n\nGPA\n\nTreatment group\n\nControl group\n\nPerformance rate\n\nTreatment group\n\nControl group\n\nSuccess rate\n\nTreatment group\n\nControl group\n\nN\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n.91\n\n.78\n\n.53\n\n.47\n\n.59\n\n.51\n\n.76\n\n.71\n\n.36\n\n.34\n\n.37\n\n.36\n\n.18\n\n.17\n\n.22\n\n123\n\n\f780\n\nHigh Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788\n\nLevene test was applied to check for homocedasticity. The ANOVA yielded statistically\nsignificant differences in the post-test means of the treatment group, as compared to the\nmeans of the control group, in two of the four scales\u2014i.e., \u2018\u2018study planning\u2019\u2019 (F = 11.59,\np \\ .01) and \u2018\u2018use of study materials\u2019\u2019 (F = 11.00, p \\ .01) (Table 2).\n\nWith regard to Hypothesis 5, again, the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test corroborated a\nnormal distribution both in the pre- and post-test scores on the four Study Habits Inventory\nScales on cognitive and metacognitive strategies (Pozar 2002). Following, the t-student\ndependent test showed statistically significant differences between the treatment group\u2019s\npre-test and post-test results regarding the four sub-scales of \u2018\u2018contextual conditions of\nstudy\u2019\u2019 (t = -2.41, p \\ .05), \u2018\u2018study planning\u2019\u2019 (t = -4.73, p \\ .001), \u2018\u2018use of study\nmaterials\u2019\u2019 (t = -6.84, p \\ .001), and \u2018\u2018learning of study content\u2019\u2019 (t = -4.46, p \\ .001)\n(Table 2).\n\nIn relation to Hypothesis 6, the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test also yielded a normal dis-\ntribution of the tutors\u2019 pre-test and post-test scores on the four cognitive and metacognitive\nstrategies scales on Pozar\u2019s Study Habits Inventory (2002). Afterward, the t-student\ndependent test revealed an increase of the average scores in the 4 scales of cognitive and\nmetacognitive strategies, although only the variables \u2018\u2018contextual conditions of study\u2019\u2019\n(t = -3.02, p \\ .01) and \u2018\u2018study planning\u2019\u2019 (t = -2.33, p \\ .05) were statistically sig-\nnificant (Table 3).\n\nFinally, after obtaining a normal distribution from the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov the pre-\nand post-test on Social Skills Scale (Gismero 2000) scores on the five sub-scales, the\nt-student dependent test indicated statistically significant differences on both the sub-scale\n\u2018\u2018ability of saying \u2018no\u2019 and cutting off interactions\u2019\u2019 (t = -2.13, p \\ .05) and the overall\nSocial skills scale score (t = -2.07, p \\ .05) (Table 3).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe present study provides research-based data on a higher education peer-tutoring pro-\ngram and delves much deeper into issues that cannot be studied using other types of\nquestionnaires (e.g., academic performance and personal satisfaction with their program of\nstudy) (Topping 1996). More concretely, this study was designed to ascertain the useful-\nness of the PTP\u2014a program designed to improve teaching and learning among freshmen\nand their tutors by focusing on concrete aspects of student development (e.g., independent\nlearning, cognitive and metacognitive strategies, social skills). The conclusions of the\nstudy are the following: First, the PTP did not have a statistically significant impact on\nfreshmen\u2019s GPA, PR, SR, and, hence, hypotheses 1, 2 and 3 could not be accepted. Second,\nby contrast, as a result of the PTP, there was a statistically significant difference between\nthe freshmen\u2019s treatment and the control groups in some of their cognitive and metacog-\nnitive strategies (i.e., \u2018\u2018study planning\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018use of study materials\u2019\u2019); and, therefore,\nHypothesis 4 can be partially accepted. Third, when compared to the pre-tests, the post-\ntests of the freshmen\u2019s treatment group indicated that the PTP did statistically significantly\nenhance cognitive and metacognitive strategies (i.e., \u2018\u2018contextual conditions of study\u2019\u2019,\n\u2018\u2018study planning\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018use of study materials\u2019\u2019, and \u2018\u2018learning of study content\u2019\u2019), confirming,\ntherefore, Hypothesis 5. Fourth, the PTP also proved to be beneficial for the tutor\u2019s group\nsince there was a statistically significant pre-test/post-test difference within the tutor\u2019s\ngroup regarding their cognitive and metacognitive strategies (i.e., \u2018\u2018contextual conditions\nof study\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018study planning\u2019\u2019) and their social skills (i.e., \u2018\u2018ability of saying \u2018no\u2019 and\n\n123\n\n\fTable 2 Pre-test/post-test & intragroup comparisons of freshmen treatment versus control groups regarding\ncognitive and metacognitive strategies\n\nMean\n\nSD\n\nHigh Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788\n\nPre-test\n\nContextual conditions of study\n\nTreatment group\n\nControl group\n\nStudy planning\n\nTreatment group\n\nControl group\n\nUse of study materials\n\nTreatment group\n\nControl group\n\nLearning of study content\n\nContextual conditions of study\n\nTreatment group\n\nControl group\n\nPost-test\n\nTreatment group\n\nControl group\n\nStudy planning\n\nTreatment group\n\nControl group\n\nUse of study materials\n\nTreatment group\n\nControl group\n\nPost-test\n\nLearning of study content\n\nTreatment group\n\nControl group\n\nTreatment group\n\nContextual conditions of study\n\nStudy planning\n\nUse of study materials\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nLearning of study content\n\nN\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n25.14\n\n24.48\n\n13.56\n\n13.55\n\n18.64\n\n18.43\n\n21.93\n\n21.71\n\n25.94\n\n24.67\n\n16.88\n\n13.39\n\n20.84\n\n18.58\n\n23.23\n\n21.94\n\n25.14\n\n25.94\n\n13.56\n\n16.88\n\n18.64\n\n20.84\n\n21.93\n\n23.23\n\n781\n\nd\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n.29\n\n.74\n\n.72\n\n.33\n\n.24\n\n.72\n\n.74\n\n.31\n\n123\n\n3.23\n\n3.15\n\n5.14\n\n4.75\n\n3.09\n\n3.19\n\n4.36\n\n3.27\n\n3.28\n\n3.39\n\n3.98\n\n5.31\n\n2.82\n\n3.40\n\n4.13\n\n3.66\n\n3.23\n\n3.28\n\n5.14\n\n3.98\n\n3.09\n\n2.82\n\n4.36\n\n4.13\n\n\f782\n\nTable 2 continued\n\nControl group\n\nContextual conditions of study\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nControl group\n\nStudy planning\n\nUse of study materials\n\nLearning of study content\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nN\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\nHigh Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788\n\nMean\n\nSD\n\nd\n\n.06\n\n.03\n\n.04\n\n.07\n\n24.48\n\n24.67\n\n13.55\n\n13.39\n\n18.43\n\n18.58\n\n21.71\n\n21.94\n\n3.15\n\n3.39\n\n4.75\n\n5.31\n\n3.19\n\n3.40\n\n3.27\n\n3.66\n\ncutting off interactions\u2019\u2019 and the total Social Skills Scale score) respectively. As such,\nhypotheses 6 and 7 can also be partly accepted.\n\nGiven the particular purposes of the study, the results ought to be interpreted not only\nconsidering the probability and statistical significance values (Goldschmid 1976); but,\nalso, and perhaps more importantly, on the basis of the effect size (Coe and Merino 2003;\nFr\u0131 \u0301as et al. 2000; Glass et al. 1981). In fact, the effect size allows one to reach more useful\nconclusions in relation to the potency of the results (Cohen 1988). In this sense, the values\nof the effect size in the dependent variables for hypotheses 1, 2, and 3 allow one to see that\nfreshmen in the treatment group scored higher than 58% on GPA, PR and SR than their\ncounterparts in the control group. Furthermore, bearing in mind Coe and Merino\u2019s (2003)\nsuggestion that an effect size higher that .1 would constitute an already noteworthy\nimprovement, the effect sizes obtained in this study for each of the aforementioned aspects\n(i.e., .18, .17, and .22, respectively) become quite remarkable, especially when taking into\naccount the size of the effect accumulates over time (see also Glass, et al. 1981; Keselman\net al. 1998; Ledesma et al. 2008). Considering, furthermore, that PTP also had statistically\nsignificant effects on the treatment group\u2019s acquisition of \u2018\u2018cognitive and metacognitive\nstrategies,\u2019\u2019 it could be affirmed that PTP did contribute to enhance academic success\n(Benavent and Fossati 1990; Ferna \u0301ndez et al. 2003; Griffin and Griffin 1997; Higgins 2004;\nLake 1999; Nestel and Kidd 2003; Topping 1996, 2005; Tuckman 2003; Xu et al. 2001).\nThese results are particularly relevant for Academic and Student Affairs professionals,\nsince they can champion and consistently use this research-based innovative practice to\nimprove critical current indicators of quality in higher education (e.g., course completion\nrates, success rates, student retention, graduation rates, student satisfaction, student per-\nsonal and professional development, and citizenship). We do also agree with Kuh (2009)\nthat Academic and Student Affairs professionals could also take the lead in monitoring\nstudent participation in these and other high-impact educational activities, while working\nwith academic administrators and faculty to find ways to create effective and efficient\nopportunities for students, especially for those who start college with two or more \u2018\u2018risk\u2019\u2019\nfactors (e.g., being academically underprepared, being the first in the family to go to\ncollege, or coming from low-income backgrounds). Moreover, the PTP offers a viable\n\n123\n\n\fHigh Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788\n\nTable 3 Tutors\u2019 pre-test/post-\ntest comparisons of cognitive\nand metacognitive strategies\nand social skills\n\nMean\n\nSD\n\nContextual conditions of study\n\nN\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\n41\n\nStudy planning\n\nUse of study materials\n\nLearning of study content\n\n26.74\n\n27.49\n\n18.50\n\n19.28\n\n21.00\n\n21.46\n\n24.81\n\n25.46\n\n24.94\n\n25.53\n\n11.78\n\n12.31\n\n17.44\n\n18.42\n\n14.33\n\n15.25\n\n2.40\n\n2.19\n\n4.18\n\n3.51\n\n2.04\n\n2.50\n\n2.97\n\n3.13\n\n4.62\n\n4.21\n\n2.92\n\n2.69\n\n3.45\n\n3.49\n\n2.71\n\n2.45\n\nSelf-expression in social situations\n\nExpression of discomfort and annoyance\n\nAbility of saying \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 and cutting off interactions\n\nAbility to make requests\n\nGlobal direct scoring\n\n97.14\n\n101.39\n\n15.16\n\n13.22\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\nPre-test\n\nPost-test\n\n783\n\nd\n\n.32\n\n.20\n\n.20\n\n.21\n\n.13\n\n.18\n\n.28\n\n.36\n\n.30\n\nmodel to institutions of higher learning as to how to allocate their resources and organize\ntheir student support services in order to foster student participation in activities positively\nassociated with persistence, satisfaction, learning and graduation. The PTP also proves to\nbe useful regarding the recommendations of Goldschmid (1976), Schroeder (2004) and\nWhitt et al. (2008), in the sense that it capitalizes on existing human resources (i.e.,\nstudents) at low or no cost and without extensive involvement of additional staff.\n\nAdditionally, this study has demonstrated the usefulness of the PTP for the tutors, who,\non their part, improved some of their cognitive and metacognitive strategies and social\nskills. In this regard, the present study can be considered to be a pioneering one because,\nalthough the data on the tutors stemmed only from a one-group pre-test/post-test design\n(Ato 1995; Campbell and Stanley 1963), and despite that these data are incidental or\nunintended outcomes of the study, they did indicate a variety of benefits of the PTP upon\nthese veteran students (e.g., increasing their confidence in communicating and presenting,\ngaining additional experience in managing people, enhancing their curriculum vitas,\nimproving their ability to manage at work-placement interviews). This is particularly\nrelevant in a context where older students orient their careers toward teaching, either\nwithin the university (e.g., as teaching assistants, young professors, tutors) or outside of\n\n123\n\n\f784\n\nHigh Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788\n\nhigher education (e.g., as school teachers, organization managers). In addition to com-\npensating for some of their shortcomings in their academic and professional preparation\n(Kuh 2009), the PTP may have also provided them with value recognition and status\namong their younger peers, as well as contributed to the bettering of both the institutions\u2019\nlearning culture (Carter and McNeill 1998) and student success. Another aspect to consider\nin regard to the tutors is that their selection was based precisely on their already sophis-\nticated level of cognitive and metacognitive strategies and social skills. As such, these\nlevels may have produced a \u2018\u2018regression effect\u2019\u2019 in the sample (Campbell and Stanley\n1963); notwithstanding this fact, the tutors did show an improvement on their post-test\nscores in some aspects of both Pozar\u2019s Study Habits Inventory (2002) and Gismero\u2019s\nSocial Skills Scale (2000), a fact that, once again, may point to the usefulness of the PTP\nfor these students.\n\nIn view of this, it is reasonable to suggest that if institutional development is to begin to\ninfluence curriculum delivery, it will be necessary to reassess the role of higher education\ntutors as well as to reappraise the interrelatedness between what, in the past, have been\nconsidered to be separate areas (i.e., student guidance and the curriculum itself) (Carter and\nMcNeill 1998). In this new scenario, the Academic Affairs and the Student Affairs units\nwill have to draw upon examples of educational practices that include purposeful student-\nfaculty contact; collaboration among faculty and staff; and active and collaborative peer-\nlearning and peer-tutoring strategies in order to enhance their programs and provide\nappropriate services that engage students not only in the learning process, but also in the\nexercise of their rights and duties, as indicated in Article 46 of Spain\u2019s Organic Law of\nUniversities (Ministerio de Educacio \u0301n, Cultura y Deporte 2001).\n\nUnder these circumstances, it can be deemed logical to continue researching the\npedagogical, psychological and social variables involved in the enhancement of teaching\nand learning within programs such as the PTP. Also, to extend what has been found in the\npresent study, researchers may want to address the complexity of peer-tutoring programs\nemploying more sophisticated experimental designs. For instance, researchers could\ninvestigate aspects such as the effects of peer-tutoring programs on student motivation,\nexpectations, learning styles (Tinto 1993), or cultural norms (Guiffrida 2006), the effects of\nthese programs over the long term (i.e., beyond one academic year), the particularities of\nthe different learning dynamics students engage in depending on their filed of study or the\ntype of subject matter studied (e.g., compulsory or elective, letters or sciences), and\nwhether there exists a correlation between the improvements of the peer-tutors and those of\ntheir tutees, and in what areas. Also, to improve the measurement of the higher-level\nthinking and independent learning that academic tasks at the college level and to strength\nthe learning skills intervention element of future peer-tutoring programs will require more\nsophisticated instruments\u2014instruments able to capture not only the type of cognitive and\nmetacognitive learning strategies students use as self-regulatory processes (Kitsantas et al.\n2008), but also the complexity of the dynamic interactive systems students operate under\n(Phan 2010). In this regard, we remain committed to the notion of deliberately embedding\nthe PTP within the institutional agenda as an intricate part of the education system so as to\nleverage significant institutional change concerning student success (Arco et al. 2005).\n\nIn sum, the overall results of the present study seem particularly relevant given the \u2018\u2018airs\nof change\u2019\u2019 affecting HE in Europe, where the Bologna Process recommends the devel-\nopment of certain student skills such as self-reflection, independent learning, and self-\nassessment (European University Association 2007). Terms such as \u2018\u2018student centredness\u2019\u2019\nand \u2018\u2018learner autonomy\u2019\u2019 may have little meaning to students entering HE; thus, these terms\nmay need to be made explicit at the start of the study program. The emphasis here needs to\n\n123\n\n\fHigh Educ (2011) 62:773\u2013788\n\n785\n\nplaced be on how guidance at an early stage of a college program may foster the devel-\nopment of student autonomy (Carter and McNeill 1998). In this line, the PTP and its\ncorresponding study could be taken as two examples of those \u2018\u2018best practices\u2019\u2019 recom-\nmended by the Spanish Network of University Quality Assurance Agencies (Red Espan \u0303ola\nde Agencias de Calidad Universitaria 2009). As such, both the PTP and this study could be\nvery useful to Academic Affairs and Student Affairs professionals, as well as other\nstakeholders involved in warranting quality within the European Higher Education Area\n(e.g., those in charge of institutional quality issues, Deans and Vice-Chancellors, or\ninstitutional auditors such as those in the AUDIT Program set by the Spanish National\nEvaluation and Quality Insurance Agency). Moreover, we understand that the PTP and the\npresent study contribute to the development of the internal systems of warranty quality,\nsince they do clearly respond to one of the criteria set by the European National Quality\nAssurance (Vicerrectorado para la Garantia de la Calidad 2008). Finally, institutions of\nhigher education aiming at building a body of evidence from which to demonstrate their\neffectiveness and their ability to meet accountability demands in order to obtain scarce\nresources and facilitate change may benefit considerably from creating, supporting and\nresearching programs like the PTP.\n\nAcknowledgments This paper was written under funding from the Ministry of Science and Innovation of\nSpain, National Research Plan I?D?i Grant Ref.

Students aged 9\u201312 years from Scotland and Catalonia were matched to act as\ntutors in their own language and as tutees in a modern foreign language. Students were intended to\nimprove both their first language (through helping the tutee) and a modern language (with their tutor\u2019s\nhelp). The methodology combined a quasi-experimental design and a qualitative analysis of texts. For\nCatalan students, pre-post test results indicated statistically significant improvements in reading\ncomprehension (while acting as tutors) and writing (while acting as tutees). Scottish students improved\nonly their writing (acting as tutees). Analysis of the texts showed that when more support was given, the\ntutor had more learning opportunities, but then there were fewer opportunities for the tutee, and vice\nversa. Thus the tutee learned more with less elaborated feedback, leading to fewer opportunities for tutor\nimprovement. This paradox could be resolved by adjusting the scaffolding support given by tutors, to\ncreate a balanced interactive learning context for both members of the pair.\n\n(cid:1) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\nConstructivist teaching and learning perspectives (Wertsch, 1993) and communication approaches related to pragmatic language (Milian\n& Camps, 2006) both agree on the importance of building meaningful and authentic contexts for learning. In these, functional commu-\nnication is required, with a real audience to give meaning to practices and enhance learning from reflection on them. However, traditionally\nschools have focused on somewhat detached exercises in spelling and syntax, rather than on using language as a practical communicative\ntool to achieve social purposes which can go beyond the classroom (Camps, 2003; Halliday, 1982). More recently, the progressive devel-\nopment and use of virtual environments (Momino\u0301, Sigale\u0301s, & Meneses, 2008) have enabled the opening of communication between\nstudents from different countries, promoting foreign language use in authentic collaborative contexts and enhancing communication and\nlearning by interaction among equals.\n\nThis paper provides data on reciprocal online peer tutoring which is intended to improve both Spanish and English languages through\nwriting in a modern foreign language (L2) as tutees and correcting text in a first native language (L1) as tutors. In our multilingual contexts,\nfor many Catalan students Spanish is not their first language, nor is English for some Scottish pupils. However, for practical purposes, we will\nconsider Spanish and English as L1 and L2 for Catalan students; and vice versa for the Scottish. In this project, Catalan students had the role\nof Spanish language tutors for Scottish students, checking their text through a virtual platform and providing support for improvement. The\nScottish pupils were English language tutors for the Catalan students.\n\nIn previous research, both quantitative analysis (Thurston, Duran, Cunningham, Blanch, & Topping, 2009) and qualitative analysis (Duran,\nBlanch, Thurston, & Topping, 2010) showed how students who participated improved in both languages (unlike the control groups).\n\n* Corresponding author.

Topping et al. / Computers & Education 61 (2013) 225\u2013231\n\nHowever, a deeper statistical analysis showed that the Spanish improved more. The substantial improvement of the Catalans as tutors\nshowed the importance of the degree and type of assistance they offered, which was greater than that offered by the Scottish. Catalan tutors\nprovided more scaffolded support requiring more active reflection and discussion from both the tutor and the tutee. However, further\nanalysis was required. Thus we designed the present study, which introduced specific training for peer tutors. It has been frequently noted\nthat initial training is linked to the quality of support tutors offer to their tutees (Cohen, Kulik, & Kulik, 1982). The objective of this research\nwas to investigate the effects of these peer supports in improving language skills in both languages.\n\n2. Background and brief theoretical foundation\n\nPeer tutoring consists of people of similar social status helping others to learn and learning themselves by teaching (Topping, 2000).\nOnline peer tutoring is peer interaction typically at a distance through Information and Communication Technology (ICT) which promotes\nmutual learning. In recent years, many investigations have concluded that exchanges between students from different countries can\nfacilitate the learning of languages and knowledge building (e.g., Vinagre, 2010). The development of technological tools has been described\nby Godwin-Jones (2003). These include more traditional means of email, discussion forums and chat, but also more recent methods such as\nblogs, wikis, and RSS feeds. This has led to what has been called TPALL (Technology for Peer Assisted Language Learning), with rich and\nvaried practices (Dehkinet & Topping, 2010).\n\nRecent studies underscore the importance of the quality of interaction between students as one of the key issues for peer learning\n(Storch, 2002). It is important to organize student interactions to enhance real learning opportunities. Peer tutoring in this study is based on\npairs of students playing a double asymmetrical role \u2013 both tutee and tutor, in a structured framework planned by teachers (Duran & Vidal,\n2004). This way of learning is very suitable for the development of receptive and expressive language skills in both L1 and L2, the students\nlearning through writing and revision of written texts (Duran et al., 2010). The current project is a variant of \u201cemail dialogue journaling\u201d as\ndescribed by Shang (2005), but in this case between students from different countries. It also has some similarity with \u201ctandem learning\u201d\n(Little et al., 1999; Vinagre, 2010). However, instead of using email, students used a virtual platform on which each pair exchanged their texts\nand their corrections.\n\nConcerning writing in particular, several authors (Castello\u0301, In\u0303esta, Pardo, Liesa, & Marti\u0301nez-Ferna\u0301ndez, 2010; Dysthe, Samar, &\nWestrheim, 2006; Storch, 2002) indicate that proofreading in pairs assists reflection on the writing process and improves the quality of\ntexts, whether in first or foreign languages. This relates to, but is not part of, the current project. Collaborative review, as opposed to\nindividual review, involves a greater degree of revision and changes in the text (Allal, 2000; Lindblom-Yla\u0308nne, Pihlajama\u0308ki, & Kotka, 2006)\nthrough viewing the text from another perspective (Yang, 2010). Again this relates to, but is not part of, the current project.\n\nTurning to factors that are part of the current study, Cassany (2002) points out that correcting the text of other students promotes self-\nregulation, provides opportunities for linguistic reflection and allows the teacher to focus on the writing process. Also, writing to\ncommunicate with a partner is not the same as writing for the teacher. Several authors (Camps, 2003; Cassany, 2002; Milian, 2003) agree\nthat the sense of audience is inherent in peer practices and that writing is a process of social interaction and negotiation of meaning between\nwriter and reader (Nystrand, 1989; Prior, 2006). Both of these were incorporated in the training provided for participants in this study.\n\nFrom a socio-cultural perspective, providing assistance within the zone of proximal development is a function of the collaboration\n(Wells, 1999) which underpins the effectiveness of peer review in the learning of L1, since the student who performs the tutor role (and is an\nexpert in L1) should review the peer text and offer adjusted support including text correction to improve its quality. This process requires\neffort to clarify doubts and rework explanations, and is tailored by the tutor, requiring excellent tutor comprehension of the text. This\nsupports the idea that in teaching their tutee, the tutor also learns (Cho & Cho, 2010; Cortese, 2005; Roscoe & Chi, 2007). On the other hand,\nthe peer review also promotes L2 learning, because students acting as tutees rewrite the text based on the immediate feedback of the tutor,\nadapted to the tutee\u2019s needs (Min, 2006; Nelson & Schunn, 2009).\n\nHowever, not all peer review is equally effective (Gibbs & Simpson, 2004; Gielen, Peeters, Dochy, Onghena, & Struyven, 2010; Nelson &\nSchunn, 2009). Research in this area warns of the difficulties of some students in making objective assessments of their peers (Lindblom-\nYla\u0308nne et al., 2006). Social aspects between pairs, especially those related to cultural knowledge, can also impede communication (Vinagre,\n2005). It is therefore necessary to take into account the quality of aid or feedback (Liang, 2010; Nelson & Schunn, 2009). A review of studies\non the quality of feedback (Topping, 2010) concludes that non-directive feedback is more effective for students with high skills, whereas more\nelaborate feedback might be suited to students with low abilities. Consequently, it highlights the importance of prior training of the tutors (Min,\n2006). In summary, there is a need on the one hand for greater effort in tutor training to provide support for linguistic reflection, and on the other\nto analyze the different types of feedback offered and their relation to the improvement of language competence in both languages.\n\nIn the present investigation tutors were trained to note errors and provide suggestive but not directive error correction for the tutee, who\nthen thought about the issue, developed their own response to the problem and corrected the error themself \u2013 hopefully learning by\nsucceeding. Peer tutors were to avoid giving the answer or solution directly. Instead they offered assistance requiring the active participation\nof the tutee, such as merely marking the error or more assertively marking the error and giving a clue (by reminding, questioning, explaining\nor modeling). Finally, it was considered important to give encouragement to the partner for their progress and efforts in the proper use of\nthe second language.\n\n3. Objectives and research questions\n\nThe objective of this research was to analyze whether reciprocal peer tutoring with students from the fifth and sixth grades in Scottish\n\nand Catalan schools produced improvements in languages L1 and L2. The questions guiding the research were:\n\n1 What are the effects of reciprocal peer tutoring in improving first language competence?\n2 Can reading the text critically and providing feedback improve the learning of the first language in the tutor? Language competence data\nwere collected at pre- and post-test. It was expected to find statistically significant differences and understand the factors underpinning\nthe analysis of texts and the quality of feedback offered by the tutor.\n\n\fK.J. Topping et al. / Computers & Education 61 (2013) 225\u2013231\n\n227\n\n3 What are the effects of reciprocal peer tutoring on competence in the second language? Does writing for a peer and receiving support\nfor correction improve second language competence? Second language competence data were collected pre- and post-test. It was\nexpected to find statistically significant differences and understand the factors underpinning the analysis of texts and the use of\nfeedback by the tutor.\n\n4. Methodology\n\n4.1. Sample\n\n4.2. Design\n\n4.3. Procedure\n\n4.4. Measures\n\nThe project involved 24 sixth grade Catalan students and 20 fifth grade Scottish students. The participants\u2019 ages ranged between 9 and 12\nyears. Pairs of students, one from each school, were formed by matching students at similar levels of ability in L1. Each student played the\nrole of tutor in their own language and tutee in a modern foreign language, in an online environment. Three teachers took part. In Scotland\none teacher was responsible for both the Spanish and English work; while in Catalonia one teacher was responsible for the Spanish and\nanother for the English.\n\nAn approach was used that combined quantitative and qualitative methodologies. A quantitative methodology was used to determine\npre-post changes in intra-subject ability in L1 and L2, and qualitative methodology was used to explore what mechanisms might have\ninfluenced these changes. We chose not to use a control group for three reasons. First, research has already frequently found that peer\ntutoring and cooperative learning are effective (Ginsburg-Block, Rohrbeck, & Fantuzzo, 2006; Johnson & Johnson, 2009; Roscoe & Chi, 2007).\nSecond, the study preceding the present study used a control group and demonstrated effectiveness in the intervention group compared to\nthe controls (Duran et al., 2010). Finally, in this case we were principally interested in the relationship between pupil outcomes and the\nnature of the interaction. Regarding the interactive process within pairs, we considered three variables: types of errors detected, level of\nfeedback offered and the tutee\u2019s response to the correction of the tutor.\n\nConsidering types of errors detected, errors were categorized according to morphosyntax (articles and conjunctions, punctuation, verbs,\ngender and number, word order, prepositions, and pronouns), spelling (according to Go\u0301mez, 2002 - letters, initials and syllables) and\nvocabulary (appropriate use of vocabulary). Considering level of feedback offered by the tutor, we used seven categories, each graded from\nthe highest to lowest level: 1) Mark the error, give the correct answer and an explanation, 2) Mark the error and give the correct answer, 3)\nMark the error and offer an explanation that helps the tutee to correct the error, 4) Mark the error and offer some hint(s) and prompt(s) to\nhelp the tutor to correct the error, 5) Mark the error, 6) Prompt, 7) Ask questions, and 7) Praise effort and improvement. Finally, considering\nthe tutee\u2019s response to the correction of the tutor, we examined the text to see whether the later versions of compositions incorporated\nmodifications in relation to the feedback received by the tutors.\n\nStudents interacted through the virtual learning platform of the University of Dundee (Blackboard), each with an individual password.\nFrom the results of tests of language skill in their own language, matched pairs were created at similar levels of first language proficiency.\nThe students were told that each would act as tutor of the first language to their partner. They would learn by teaching in L1. Acting as tutees,\neach would improve their texts and learn through the feedback received to improve L2. Each student needed to write five texts in the foreign\nlanguage and improve from the corrections received, and in turn correct the messages from their partner in L1. We trained students to learn\nto correct the texts offering different types of feedback.\n\nThe schools worked on the project for four hours per week for five weeks. The task of writing was on free text chosen by the students, but\nif necessary teachers could offer guidance or thematic vocabulary. A text was exchanged every week - the text was written, sent, received\nfeedback for correction and was improved by the tutee and resent to the peer tutor. This process was repeated until each student had sent\na total of five texts in L2, responded to feedback and resent an improved version, and had sent five texts in L1.\n\nReading comprehension and writing ability in L1 and L2 were the dependent variables. The following instruments were used:\n\n(cid:2) Reading comprehension in English. Scottish students were administered the test \u201cPerformance Indicators in Primary Schools Primary 7\u201d\n(Curriculum, Evaluation and Management Centre, 2004). For reliability the test has a Cronbach alpha of 0.97 for a sample of 642\nstudents and 0.82 was recorded in the study sample.\n\n(cid:2) Reading comprehension in Spanish. Catalan Students were administered the test \u201cEvaluation of Reading Comprehension\u201d (Catala\u0300,\nComes, & Renom, 2001), which raises questions of understanding texts of different sources, with a Kuder\u2013Richardson reliability of 0.83.\n(cid:2) Second language composition. Students had a free writing task consisting of writing a message to fellow tutors and explaining\nsomething about themselves. This writing was evaluated using the formulas described by Wolfe-quintero, Inagaki, and Kim (1998) for\nscores on fluency (number of words per sentence), accuracy (errors per sentence) and complexity (clauses per sentence). The analysis of\nthe correction of the children\u2019s pre and post composition was done by one investigator.\n\n(cid:2) Textual Analysis. We analyzed the texts of a sample of 19 pairs across the spectrum of ability, with a total of 102 English texts (written by\nCatalan students) and 88 Spanish texts (written by Scottish students). The analysis of all messages in Spanish and English was conducted\nby two researchers. To ensure inter-rater reliability we analyzed 38 texts (20%) and obtained an inter-rater reliability coefficient of 0.98\n(Herna\u0301ndez, Ferna\u0301ndez, & Baptista, 2006).\n\n\f228\n\nK.J. Topping et al. / Computers & Education 61 (2013) 225\u2013231\n\n(cid:2) Semi-structured interviews. At the end of the intervention, interviews were conducted with 14 students (7 per country) selected\n\nrandomly from the experimental sample. Interviews were also conducted with the four teachers involved.\n\n4.5. Analysis\n\nThe quantitative results were analyzed using inferential statistical tests (t-tests) within and between groups. The qualitative results from\nthe second language compositions, textual analysis and interviews were analyzed by the method of constant comparisons, eliciting themes\nand then confirming them by repeated analysis. The textual analysis started with the categories that emerged as a result of the last project\n(morphosyntactic, lexical, etc.) and added new ones developed during the present analysis.\n\n5. Results\n\n5.1. Reading comprehension tutor L1\n\nThe first objective of the research was to determine whether the development of the role of tutor, reading texts critically and offering\ntutee assistance for their correction, had an impact on the linguistic competence in L1 tutor. Table 1 shows the results obtained by the tutors\nin reading comprehension. The results of the t test for paired samples showed that Catalan tutors significantly improved reading\ncomprehension in L1, but the Scots (although improving) did not achieve statistical significance. It is noteworthy that the number of tutor\ntexts worked at both schools were very similar \u2013 there were only 12% of texts not sent successfully by Scottish students and 15% not sent by\nthe Catalans. Four elements may have contributed to the significant improvement of the Catalan tutors: the level of challenge within the\ntext, the selection and correction of basic mistakes, the error type and the type of correction and feedback offered by the tutor.\n\n5.2. Level of challenge of the text for tutors\n\nSpanish texts contained an error rate of 10.23% (901 errors in 88 texts sent). The error rate in English language texts was lower \u2013 5.09%\n(520 errors in 102 documents sent). The texts in Spanish had a higher error rate and were more complex to correct. Texts containing many\nerrors create a greater challenge for the tutor, who should identify the basic ideas and connect them to attribute meaning to the text. As one\nCatalan teacher said in the interview: \u201cThere were phrases that were not understood, and then pupils asked me for lots of help, and I told\nthem that I didn\u2019t understand either\u201d. This extra effort by the Catalan tutors may have contributed to an improvement in their competence in\nL1, unlike their fellow Scots, who worked with texts with half this amount of mistakes.\n\n5.3. Tutor\u2019s decision on the selection of error correction\n\nThe high rate of error in Spanish texts created a greater challenge for Catalan tutors, who selected and corrected 613 of the 901 possible\nerrors (68.04%). However, despite the fact that English texts contained half as many errors, the Scottish tutors selected and corrected 341 of\nthe 520 possible errors (65.68%). In the interview, a Catalan teacher said: \u201cI think the Scots have done better corrections than we have,\nbecause they have selected fewer errors. We told our students not to correct it all, because they wanted to fix everything\u201d. Although the\npercentage of error correction is similar in both schools, in absolute terms Catalan tutors selected almost twice as many errors to correct.\n\n5.4. Type of error corrected by the tutor\n\nThe type of errors students selected and corrected in both countries is summarized in Table 2. Catalan tutors corrected more mor-\nphosyntactic errors (55.46% of corrections compared to 36.66% of their Scottish colleagues), particularly articles and conjunctions, and\ngender and number. While the tutors from both schools seem to have a similar percentage, there were again significant differences in lexical\nerror correction, in which the Scottish tutors provided more than double the feedback than the Catalan students. It seems that the\ncorrections of the Spanish tutors focused primarily on morphosyntactic errors, which relate to aspects of textual coherence and cohesion.\nThis can be linked to deeper linguistic reflection and this type of correction might offer more learning opportunities for tutors in L1.\n\n5.5. Type of feedback offered by the tutor\n\nThe type of feedback offered by the tutors is seen as a metalinguistic opportunity for learning in L1. After selecting the error, the tutor\nprovides feedback for tutee correction. Although in the initial training the students were instructed to offer the minimum level of support\npossible so the tutee corrected the error by themselves, tutors tended to choose the level of support for each error. Table 3 shows the results\naccording to the degree of support. Praising is considered the minimal form of feedback for error correction; while marking the error,\nexplaining how to correct it and providing the correct answer would be the most elaborate feedback possible.\n\nIf we compare the performances of tutors from both countries in the degree of feedback offered to tutees, Scots tutors tend to praise,\nquestion and correct more than the Catalans. Catalan tutors, however, offered more prompts and clues when correcting.

Catalan tutors, however, tended to offer more scaffolded feedback (81.07% cf. 66.33% of\nScots). A Catalan teacher noted: \u201cTo correct helped them a lot, especially after seeing how the Scottish children wrote in Spanish. The Catalan\ntutors have seen the difficulties, have realized that this was not correct Spanish and they have been giving good or bad prompts, but were\nable to reflect on this\u201d.\n\nProviding more detailed feedback and more direct support appears to explain the increased Catalan student learning. For the Spanish\ntutors it was more challenging to review their own knowledge and to find and offer metalinguistic information at the highest level of\nsupport for error correction. This risked decreasing the learning opportunities for the tutees, because they did not have any need to search\nfor themselves or work on correcting the error \u2013 the task was resolved by the tutor; precisely the task which offered the opportunity for\nlearning.\n\nThe second research question concerns the effect of the intervention on improving the writing of the tutee. Table 4 shows the results of\npre- and post-test in relation to the tutee in writing L2. The results show that the Catalan tutees significantly improved their texts, both in\nterms of fluency and number of errors on accuracy and complexity of the text. In contrast, the Scottish tutees showed significantly fewer\nerrors made in the text, but no statistically significant differences regarding fluency or the complexity of the text. The qualitative analysis\nneeds to be taken into account to interpret these results. This will take into consideration the percentage of correction they received from\ntheir tutors, the types of errors that were corrected, the degree of support offered by their tutors and the tutee response by rewriting the\ncorrected text.\n\nAs noted above, Scottish tutees composed texts with a high error rate (10.23%) and 613 of 901 were selected by Catalan tutors (68.04%).\nThis percentage of correction is very close to that received by Catalan tutees (65.58%), although their texts were of a higher quality (with an\nerror rate of 5.09%). This suggests that the level of feedback for text correction is very similar for both languages.\n\nAs noted in the results of the tutors (summarized in Table 5), the Scottish tutees received a higher percentage of morphosyntactic error\nfeedback. This involved greater complexity to correct and often requiring restructuring part of the text. Without that restructuring of text it\n\nTable 3\nFeedback offered by the tutor.\n\nTutor feedback\n\nCatalan\ntutors\n\nScottish\ntutors\n\nExamples\n\nPraise\nQuestion\nPrompt\nMark\n\n63 (9.32%)\n3 (0.44%)\n29 (4.29%)\n33 (4.88%)\n\n54 (13.67%)\n30 (7.59%)\n5 (1.27%)\n\nI enjoyed reading about your dog.

The fact that Catalan tutors provided more constructed feedback could have influenced a decline in\nthe need to rewrite the text as suggested by the tutors when the solution was already offered \u2013 and possibly also the level of interest. The\nCatalan tutees received more evenly distributed feedback (e.g., there was an increase in vocabulary), so that the restructuring of the text\ncould be easier.\n\nAfter receiving feedback from a tutor, tutees were intended to improve their texts and rewrite them, and send them via the virtual\nlearning platform. However, the Scottish tutees reworked their texts only 11.75% of the time. This would seem to be a direct result of the\nfactors listed above (detecting errors that required rewriting combined with very structured feedback, and sometimes constructed\nanswers). Thus the opportunity for improvement in writing for Scottish pupils was restricted. Catalan tutees, however, mostly reworked\ntheir texts (80.65% of the time). One student said: \u201cI learned some words that I wrote badly and had been corrected, so I learned. For\nexample, in English my tutor told me that this was wrong and I had to look it up or find what it was. Sometimes it was hard to find them\u201d.\nThe Catalan tutees benefited from text with less feedback (albeit with a similar percentage of corrections cf. the Spanish texts, although with\na much lower error rate) and feedback received which was highly scaffolded, so it required active corrective action by the tutee.\n\n6. Discussion and conclusions\n\nThe results of this investigation show that differences between students can yield learning opportunities. This project looked for\ndiversity, connecting students from two countries with different levels of language competence. Through the use of ICT it was possible for\nstudents to work together although far apart in distance. We have also seen how the students were trying to write quality texts, with the\npurpose of genuine communication (Camps, 2003; Cassany, 2002; Milian & Camps, 2006). Tutees worked with real communication chal-\nlenges, with a real audience, with a peer who could also help to improve their competence in L2. The results showed that students not only\naccepted the teaching feedback of their peers, but also were willing to offer support to their peers. The initial tutor training enabled them to\ndetect errors and choose how to offer feedback to their tutee. Frequently, the tutor rewrote some parts of the text completely. That rewriting\ngave the tutee an excellent active learning opportunity. However, more than that, according to the learning to rewrite perspective\n(understanding learning to rewrite as a process of text reconstruction) (Castello\u0301 et al., 2010), the error corrections (especially those that\nrequire morphosyntactic rewritten sentences or whole passages) were a powerful learning mechanism for the tutors, combined with the\ndevelopment of feedback that enhanced tutee action.\n\nDespite the initial tutor training being identical for Catalan and Scottish students in emphasizing the need to provide the minimum level\nof support, practical actions were different in each case, showing the importance of the quality of feedback as a key to promoting learning\n(Cohen et al., 1982; Liang, 2010; Nelson & Schunn, 2009). Scottish tutors responded more exactly to the initial advice and offered more\ngeneral support. This type of feedback appears to have been the main factor responsible for the writing improvement in the Catalan tutees.\nFeedback in the form of questions or prompts dominated for Scottish tutors and that seemed to have a positive impact on the tutee, who had\nto act to correct their own mistakes.\n\nThe results obtained corroborate previous studies (Gielen et al., 2010; Topping, 2010) showing that non-directive feedback is more\neffective for students with higher skill levels (Catalan students had a higher level of English than the Scottish had Spanish). However, it does\nnot confirm that more elaborate feedback is more suitable for students with low ability (Gielen et al., 2010; Topping, 2010), as the Scottish\nstudents who received this more elaborate type of help did not improve their overall competence in writing in L2. The feedback offered by\nCatalan tutors appeared to have helped them to think more about their language, confirming previous studies where the tutor learns by\nteaching (and the tutee also learns) (Cho & Cho, 2010; Cortese, 2005; Roscoe & Chi, 2007). However, at the same time, such feedback was\nresponsible for the minor degree of improvement in their Scottish tutees. This result agrees with the study of Nelson and Schunn (2009),\nwhich also showed a negative effect of more highly scaffolded feedback.\n\nThese results lead to a paradox, because the more the tutor learns (by providing feedback with a greater level of support, including\nresolving the error), the less the tutee learns. The opposite also applies, in that the more the tutee learns (when receiving less structured\nfeedback that requires tutee action), the less the tutor learns. Of course, this paradox only applies in general, and is not necessarily seen in\nthe case of every pair. The asynchronous interaction in this project did not allow for real time interaction, which might be more effective in\n\n\fK.J.

It is well known\nthat it is difficult to provide support within the Zone of Proximal Development, that space between what the student can do by himself and\nwhat he can do to with the help of others (Vygotsky, 1995). In synchronous virtual formats or in a face-to-face relationship, the direct contact\nbetween the mediator and the learner makes this support easier than in diachronic formats such as this research project.\n\nHowever, a possible way to resolve the paradox may be to develop exemplar explanations (perhaps in a bank of resources in the\nclassroom), but not provide them unless the tutee made a specific demand. Future studies could also consider the use of software to support\ninstruction, such as Creative Technology\u2019s Markin program (2011), in which the tutor could offer feedback from some pre-arranged\npossibilities. This could also be a good way to involve the tutee in deciding the extent of help required, perhaps receiving more scaf-\nfolded prompts early in the intervention and less scaffolded prompts later. Incorporating these elements would allow a better alignment of\neducational support according to the real needs of the tutee. The equilibrium offered by such a system might be the best mechanism to\nenable students to learn by tutoring (identifying problems and offering help to resolve the error when they know the answers), and the\ntutees would learn from the carefully adjusted and contingent help to make for themselves a restructuring that makes sense for them.\n\nReferences\n\ns11251-010-9146-1.\n\nindex.php.\n\nManagement Centre.\n\nAllal, L.

One significant group reflecting this demographic shift is an increased number of \n\nfirst-generation college students, defined by The U.S. Department of Education, through the \n\nHigher Education Act (2011) as \u201cAn individual both of whose parents did not complete a \n\nbaccalaureate degree\u201d (p. 9).  First-generation college students tend to be less academically \n\nprepared, as compared to peers whose parents graduated from college (Engle, Bermeo, & \n\nO\u2019Brien, 2006).  Academic support resources, such as national peer tutoring certified programs, \n\nmay be helpful to increase success to this population.  The purpose of this qualitative case study \n\nwas to explore the experiences of first-generation college students with peer tutoring to better \n\nunderstand the value of peer tutoring as perceived by these students.  This study used a multiple \n\ncase study approach to examine peer tutoring programs at two four-year, private colleges and \n\none community college.  These institutions have nationally certified peer tutoring program, \n\naccredited by the College Reading and Learning Association (CRLA) and endorsed by The \n\nCouncil of Learning Assistance and Developmental Education Associations (CLADEA).  Data \n\nwas collected using interviews, by making observations, and from documents used in these peer \n\ntutoring programs.  It was the intent of this study to identify the effective and ineffective \n\nattributes of these peer tutoring programs, as perceived by undergraduate first-generation college \n\nstudents.  This study may inform similar programs that serve first-generation college students to \n\nbetter meet the needs of this at-risk population. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\nvi \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n\nDedication.....................................................................................................iii \n\nAcknowledgements..........................................................................................iv \n\nAbstract..........................................................................................................................................v  \n\nTable of Contents .........................................................................................................................vi  \n\nChapter I.

Statement of the Problem \n\nThis qualitative study used a multiple case study design to explore the components of \n\nacademic tutoring programs.  The primary data source consisted of interviews of first-generation \n\ncollege students engaged in peer tutoring.  These students have been defined by The U.S. \n\nDepartment of Education, through the Higher Education Act (2011) as \u201cAn individual both of \n\nwhose parents did not complete a baccalaureate degree\u201d (p. 9).  Secondary data sources came \n\nfrom interviews with the peer tutors and the coordinators or directors of the peer tutoring \n\nprograms, observations of tutoring sessions, and documents related to the peer tutoring \n\nprograms.  The study took place at two four-year, private colleges and one community college \n\nthat have peer tutoring programs nationally certified by the College Reading and Learning \n\nAssociation (CRLA) and endorsed by the Council of Learning Assistance and Developmental \n\nEducation Associations (CLADEA).   \n\nThe selected colleges have full-time undergraduate students some of whom are first-\n\ngeneration college students.  The criterion for the site selection included colleges that have first-\n\ngeneration students and offer a CRLA nationally accredited peer tutoring program.  This design \n\nresulted in rich descriptions of peer tutoring programs (Merriam, 2009).  The results of this study \n\ncan be of benefit to student service professionals engaged in the development and delivery of \n\nacademic support services to improve their programs, and, ultimately, benefit first-generation \n\ncollege students who will thereby receive improved tutoring services.     \n\nAccording to existing research (Berkner & Choy, 2008; Engle & Tinto, 2008), an \n\nincreasing number of students entering college are first-generation college students.  Research \n\nhas shown that first-generation college students share various education characteristics compared \n\nwith their peers whose parents have matriculated at a college or university (Choy, 2001; Engle et \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\n2 \n\n \n\nal., 2006; Thayer, 2000).  First-generation college students who begin at a baccalaureate \n\ninstitution enter college less academically prepared for college and have lower educational \n\naspirations than their peers whose parents received bachelor\u2019s degrees (Choy, 2001).  Moreover, \n\nnearly 24% of all undergraduate first-generation college students are from low-income families \n\n(Engle & Tinto, 2008).  Engle & Tinto (2008) have found that low-income, first-generation \n\ncollege students are 26% more likely not to return to college after their first year compared with \n\n7% of their peers. \n\nSince only 25% of this population who are low-income enrolled in a baccalaureate \n\ncollege (Engle & Tinto, 2008), the significance of these students\u2019 successes or failures in relation \n\nto graduation (Chen, 2005; Engle et al., 2006) impacts whole communities rather than only \n\nindividual students.   Financial help has been made available, but it may not be the only help \n\nnecessary to assist every student.  In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Higher \n\nEducation Act to provide funds for low-income families sending their children to college.   In a \n\nspeech made by President Johnson related to the passage of this Act, he informed the audience to \n\nconvey to young people that if they worked hard, college could be a reality (Johnson, 1965).  \n\nWhile attending higher education institutions may be possible as a result of this Act, success \n\nwithin these institutions may be more challenging for first-generation college students. \n\nSome of the difficulties not addressed by the Higher Education Act are evident in \n\ngraduation rates.  While first-generation college students now represent a larger portion of the \n\nundergraduate student population (Engle & Tinto, 2008; Berkner & Choy, 2008), this at-risk \n\ngroup will graduate at a lower rate than their college peers.   The National Center for Education \n\nStatistics estimates that from the number of students enrolled in post-secondary institutions, 27% \n\nare dependents of their parents and 58% are independent first-generation college students \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\n3 \n\n \n\n(Berkner & Choy, 2008).  Despite representing a large portion of the undergraduate student \n\npopulation, only 26% will earn Bachelor\u2019s degrees as compared to 68% of their peers whose \n\nparents went to college (Chen, 2005; Engle et al., 2006). \n\nFirst-generation college students are considered at-risk for degree completion for a \n\nnumber of reasons (Vivian, 2005).  According to Vivian (2005), first-generation college students \n\n\u201cmay be educationally underprepared, have greater financial constraints, and have less social and \n\nfamilial support than other students\u201d (p. 338).  Because first-generation college students begin \n\ntheir studies with greater academic and social needs as compared to their peers whose parents \n\ngraduated from college, these needs may prevent them from graduating (Vivian, 2005).   \n\nFirst-generation college students have been found less academically prepared for their \n\ncollege experiences (Engle et al., 2006; Thayer, 2000).  First-generation college students often \n\ntake less challenging high school courses (Thayer, 2000).  College students who completed \n\nadvanced high school courses, such as rigorous math courses, increased the likelihood that they \n\nwould enroll in a baccalaureate college and complete their degree (Chen, 2005; Choy, 2001; \n\nHorn & Nunez, 2000); however, many first-generation college students may be less academically \n\nprepared for college compared to their peers (Engle et al., 2006; Thayer, 2000).  Furthermore, \n\nfirst-generation college students often may not attempt to take academic risks or put forth great \n\neffort because their level of self-efficacy is lower, compared to non-first-generation college \n\nstudents (Ramos-Sanchez & Nichols, 2007).    \n\nMany first-generation college students are from low-income families, placing them at \n\ngreater risk for attrition (Corrigan, 2003; Engle et al., 2006).  First-generation college students \n\noften lack the financial resources from their families to sustain their education (Thayer, 2000).  \n\nTherefore, first-generation college students tend to devote more time to working while attending \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\n4 \n\n \n\ncollege.  The need to maintain income contributes to the challenges they encounter to persist and \n\nsucceed in higher education (Corrigan, 2003).  Not only does working more reduce the amount \n\nof time available to study, but it also impacts the amount of time first-generation college students \n\nhave to interact with college peers (Pascerella, Pierson, Wolniak, & Terrenzini, 2004).  \n\nFirst-generation college students may receive less encouragement from their families to \n\nprepare for or to attend college (Pascerella et al., 2004).  Because parents of first-generation \n\ncollege students did not attend college or have experience with the college system, they are less \n\nlikely to know how to pay for college expenses (Choy, 2001).   Moreover, first-generation \n\ncollege students\u2019 parents are often unable to direct their children about how to develop a plan to \n\nreceive the help that they need within the academic experience, which may result in their \n\nchildren\u2019s lack of cultural capital, which is a form of capital comprised of the skills and \n\nknowledge to make the educational experience beneficial and influential (Pascerella et al., 2004).  \n\nIn addition, these parents may not know how to direct their children to properly access essential \n\nresources on campus, resulting in their lack of social capital.  According to Thayer (2000), social \n\ncapital provides supportive resources to make a smooth transition for college students to earn a \n\ndegree.  Both social and cultural capital have been found to support the undergraduate student \n\npopulation\u2019s completion of a bachelor\u2019s degree (Pascerella et al., 2004).    \n\nProblem Statement \n\n \n\nAccording to Warburton, Bugarin, and Nunez (2001), \u201cFirst-generation students             \n\nwere less likely than their peers whose parents had a bachelor\u2019s degree to be enrolled at  \n\ntheir initial institution 3 years later and to stay on the persistence track to a bachelor\u2019s degree\u201d  \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\n5 \n\n \n\n(p. 45).  The intent of this study was to learn how academic support from nationally certified \n\npeer tutoring programs, specifically CRLA, may benefit this population with their persistence, \n\nsuccess, and retention at four year colleges and one community college.   \n\nSome of the difficulty that first-generation college students encounter results from a lack \n\nof strong academic preparation when compared to their college peers (Engle et al., 2006).  Pike \n\nand Kuh (2005) found that first-generation college students are less likely to spend time studying \n\nor engaging in dialogue with their peers regarding academic work.  While previous studies have \n\nresearched peer involvement in college, especially for first-generation college students, as a \n\nbeneficial way for students to learn how to succeed academically, according to Pascerella et al. \n\n(2004), there is a gap related to research on the efficacy of the peer tutoring training.  This study \n\nexplores three nationally certified peer tutoring programs as forms of support that may enable \n\nthese students to graduate with a baccalaureate degree because the tutoring programs encourage \n\nregular study time and dialogue within peers about academics.   \n\nResearch Question \n\nThe central question guiding this study was: How does participation in a peer tutoring \n\nprogram certified by the College Reading and Learning Association (CRLA) influence the \n\nexperience of first-generation college students at either the baccalaureate or associate level? \n\nThe sub questions were: \n\n\uf0b7  What academic skills and strategies do first-generation college students develop as a \n\nresult of participation in the peer tutoring program? \n\n\uf0b7  What types of social benefits are realized by first-generation college students as a result \n\nof participation in the peer tutoring program? \n\n\uf0b7  What components of the peer tutoring program do students perceive as most beneficial? \n\n\uf0b7  What components of the peer tutoring program do students perceive as least beneficial? \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\n6 \n\n \n\nPurpose of the Study \n\nThe purpose of this qualitative multi-case study was to explore the experiences of first-\n\ngeneration college students participating in a nationally certified peer tutoring program.  The \n\nintent of this study was to better understand the benefits, if any, and perceptions of participating \n\nundergraduate students.  The purpose was accomplished through an exploration using interviews, \n\nobservations, and documents of the peer tutoring program in which they are participating.  The \n\ndesign enabled the researcher to listen and learn about the participants\u2019 experiences, as well as \n\nthose of the peer tutors\u2019 and program coordinators\u2019 through interviews.  Observations of peer \n\ntutoring sessions and a review of the tutoring programs\u2019 documents were used as additional data \n\ncollection methods.  The result was an in-depth review of each program using within-case and \n\ncross-case analysis guided by a system of inductive inquiry to generate patterns of meanings and \n\nthemes related to peer tutoring at the selected institutions and the experiences of first-generation \n\ncollege students participating in those programs (Merriam, 2009).  The findings of this study can \n\nbuild upon the scholarly literature related to first-generation college students and inform student \n\nservices practitioners who provide academic support to first-generation college students. \n\nTheoretical Framework \n\n \n\nThe theoretical framework for this study was based upon three interrelated student \n\ndevelopment theories that are foundational to the field.  The first of those theories related to the \n\nseminal research on student retention was by Tinto (1975, 1987).  The second theory was based \n\non the classic researcher of Astin (1984), whose work was related to the implications of student \n\ninteractions with their peers.  The final student development theory framing this study was based \n\non the seven principles for good practice in undergraduate education as identified by Chickering \n\nand Gamson (1987).   \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\nTinto\u2019s (1987) theory of retention related to the combination of academic and social \n\nintegration as students become accustomed to and persist in their academic careers at a \n\nuniversity.  Academic integration occurs when students are achieving in their classes, while \n\nsocial integration refers to students developing a sense of belonging and bonding with their peers \n\nfor both academic and social reasons (Braxton, 2000).  Both social and academic integration \n\ncontribute to the success of college students (Tinto, 1987).   \n\n \n\nChickering and Gamson\u2019s (1987) seven principles for good practice in undergraduate \n\nschool included: (a) encouragement of student-faculty, (b) encouragement of cooperation, (c) \n\nencouragement of active learning, (d) prompt feedback, (e) time on task, (f) communication of \n\nhigh expectations, and (g) respect for diverse talents and ways of knowing.  By combining the \n\nsocial and academic concerns for college students, Chickering and Gamson (1987) identified the \n\nimportant role that academic support service personnel provide for students to be successful in \n\nhigher education.  Chickering and Gamson\u2019s (1987) principles for good practice outlined \n\ncharacteristics that a peer tutoring program can incorporate, such as having tutors encourage \n\ncontact and cooperation among students, promote active learning on campus, and provide prompt \n\nfeedback on student learning (Boylan, 2002). \n\n \n\nStudent development theories provide many student service professionals on campuses \n\nwith a better foundation to better meet the needs of a growing and diverse student population, \n\nsuch as first-generation college students (Engle & Tinto, 2008).  These theories can help college \n\nadministrators understand students\u2019 personal development and academic growth, as well as how \n\nstudents are connected.  By using these theories to help guide this ongoing study and the analysis \n\nof the data, new strategies may be revealed so that college administrators and support service \n\nproviders can better meet the needs of first-generation college students.  \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\n8 \n\n \n\nDelimitations \n\n \n\nTutoring programs were limited to those having national certification from CRLA.  This \n\ndecision was based on the work of Maxwell (1990), who wrote about the benefits of peer \n\ntutoring programs that adhered to standards and guidelines established by CRLA.  Higbee (2009) \n\nreferred to Maxwell, \u201cas a pioneer in the field of learning assistance and developmental \n\neducation\u201d (p.1).  Maxwell (1990) stated that, \u201cA well trained tutor can serve a vital role in \n\nhelping fellow students attain their academic goals\u201d (p. 1); therefore, training topics with peer \n\ntutors was one focus of the study.   \n\n \n\nAnother area of focus was to observe how well peer tutors modeled or demonstrated \n\nproblem solving strategies to their students.  Bandura (1997) found that when a person observed \n\nsomeone complete a task through modeling of the task it helped to increase the person\u2019s self-\n\nefficacy. \n\nThe decision to focus on selected colleges with nationally accredited programs was \n\npurposeful to ensure that comparable sites comprised each case.  The criteria for the site \n\nselection were colleges that had full-time undergraduate students, some whom were first-\n\ngeneration college students.  These institutions must also have an active and CRLA accredited \n\npeer tutoring program.   \n\nTo capture the context of the participants\u2019 experiences, the number of participants was \n\nlimited to a student population that met the criteria set through purposive sampling.  Participants \n\nwere limited to those undergraduates who are first-generation college students and participated  \n\nin the peer tutoring program.  The participants were limited to students who were pursuing a \n\nbachelor\u2019s degree. \n\n \n\n \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\n9 \n\n \n\nSignificance of the Study \n\n \n\nThe significance of this study is its potential benefit to student service practices, \n\ndelivering peer tutoring to first-generation college students.  The quality and type of academic \n\nsupport services related to peer tutoring are an important component to ensure the retention and \n\nsuccess of the first-generation college students.   According to Williams and Butler (2010), \u201cIt is \n\ncritical for college administrators and practitioners to help these students to identify, understand, \n\nand develop coping skills to help resolve their unique stressors\u201d (p. 4).  This study may lead to a \n\nbetter understanding of one of these academic support services, which can advance the \n\nknowledge of student service personnel.  This knowledge can also contribute to a greater \n\nunderstanding of first-generation college students and peer tutoring programs.  This study may \n\ncontribute to the development of techniques and procedures within a peer tutoring program that \n\nencourage persistence, retention, success, and graduation of first-generation students from a  \n\nfour-year, baccalaureate college or university.  \n\nDefinitions of Terms \n\nAt-risk students\u2013Students who \u201cmay be educationally underprepared, have greater financial \n\nconstraints, and have less social and familial support than other students\u201d (Vivian, 2005, p. 338).   \n\nFour-year Colleges\u2013Colleges or universities at which undergraduate students complete their \n\neducational degrees and attain a bachelor\u2019s degree. \n\nCommunity Colleges\u2013Colleges at which undergraduate students complete their educational \n\ndegrees and attain their associate\u2019s degree. \n\nCouncil of Learning Assistance and Developmental Education Associations (CLADEA)\u2013The \n\nnational organization that represents and endorses the College Reading Language Association.  \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\n10 \n\n \n\nCollege Reading Learning Association (CRLA)\u2013An organization recognized and endorsed by the \n\nNational Association for Developmental Education (NADE) for its standards to train peer tutors \n\nat colleges. \n\nCultural Capital\u2013A form of capital comprised of the skills and knowledge to make the \n\neducational experience beneficial and influential (Pascerella et al., 2004).    \n\nFirst-generation college students\u2013\u201cAn individual both of whose parents did not complete a \n\nbaccalaureate degree\u201d (U.S. Department of Education, 2011, p. 9).   \n\nPeer tutor\u2013A student who works with another student outside of class to reinforce a particular \n\nconcept or skill, while demonstrating specific study strategies. \n\nPersistence\u2013The quality to meet academic and social challenges and persevere to reach a goal, \n\nsuch as earn an undergraduate degree.   \n\nSelf-Efficacy\u2013\u201cBeliefs in one\u2019s capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required \n\nto produce given attainments\u201d (Bandura, 1997, p. 3). \n\nSocial Capital\u2013A form of capital that provides supportive resources to make a smooth transition \n\nfor college students to earn a degree (Thayer, 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\n11 \n\n \n\nChapter II.  Literature Review \n\nThe purpose of this qualitative multi-case study was to explore the experiences of first-\n\ngeneration college students participating in a nationally certified peer tutoring program.  The \n\nreview of the literature related to this study of first-generation college students and peer tutoring \n\nprograms consists of the following topics: (a) benefits of an undergraduate degree, (b) \n\ncommunity colleges (c) educational preparation, (d) family support, (e) transition to college, (f) \n\nsocial and cultural capital, (g) student development theory, (h) faculty and academic advisement, \n\n(i) self-efficacy theory and academic support, (j) vicarious experiences, and (k) peer tutoring \n\nprograms. \n\nBenefits of an Undergraduate Degree \n\nInvestment in higher education will benefit individuals and move economic development \n\nforward in the United States (Engle & Tinto, 2008).  Goodman (2009) stated, \u201cEducation \n\nremains a key tool to individual economic success and employment\u201d (p. 14).  According to \n\nBaum, May, and Payea (2010), when undergraduate students receive their bachelor\u2019s degrees, \n\nthey will not only earn more per capita income but also will reduce the rates of unemployment \n\nand poverty levels.  Although the rate of college enrollment has improved, the degree completion \n\nrate for the United States is low compared to other countries in the world (Callan, 2008). \n\nAccording to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics \n\n(NCES), the overall national graduation rate for college students who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \n\nis 63.2% (Radford, Berkner, Wheeless, & Shepherd, 2010).  While it is important that first-\n\ngeneration college students enter college, it is equally important that they earn a bachelor\u2019s \n\ndegree.  Engle and Tinto (2008) stated, \u201cSimply put, it is in our shared national interest to act \n\nnow to increase the number of students who not only enter college, but more importantly earn \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\n12 \n\n \n\ntheir degrees particularly baccalaureates\u201d (p. 5).  When first-generation college students do \n\nachieve their undergraduate diplomas, many other persons in their lives are the beneficiaries as \n\nwell.  The benefits of an undergraduate education are demonstrated when graduates give back to \n\ntheir communities and incorporate their new knowledge and expertise in their fields of expertise \n\n(St. John & Parsons, 2004).   \n\nCommunity Colleges \n\nWhile many high school graduates may choose to enter four-year colleges, others decide \n\nto enter two-year community colleges.  Of the current U.S. undergraduate students, 45% of first-\n\nyear students represent community college students (American Association of Community \n\nColleges, 2013).   Typically 40% of community college students are the first in their families to \n\nattend college (American Association of Community Colleges, 2013).  Students may choose to \n\nfurther their education at four-year institutions after attending a community college.   \n\nCommunity colleges are a main pipeline for students to enter in a baccalaureate college \n\nor university.  As Pusser and Levin (2009) mentioned, \u201c Community colleges have served as a \n\ngateway to university and four-year college baccalaureate programs to the extent that some state \n\npublic universities rely upon community colleges for more than 60 percent of their students who \n\ncomplete baccalaureate degrees\u201d (p. 10).  According to Carnevale and Rose\u2019s research (2011), \n\ncollege-educated workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree not only demonstrate their skills toward \n\nhigher pay but also prove to be more valued or respected by their employers.    \n\nWhile enrolling in a college education is beneficial, students who fail to complete their \n\neducation often do not profit from that endeavor.  First-generation college students are more \n\nlikely to leave before their second year of college and less likely to return to a four-year \n\ninstitution after leaving (Choy, 2001).  Folger, Carter, and Chase (2004) surmised that when \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\n13 \n\n \n\nfirst-generation college students do not finish college, \u201csociety loses their potential as \n\nenthusiastic, professional individuals\u201d (p. 472).  Moreover, according to Baum et al. (2010), \n\nstudents who earned a baccalaureate degree, compared to those who earned a high school \n\ndiploma or a two-year college degree, will earn more per capita.  Earning a bachelor\u2019s degree can \n\nbe vital, not only to society but also to the individual (Baum et al., 2010).  As researchers \n\ndiscovered, retaining students in higher education is just as important as obtaining students to \n\nenroll.  Research also recommended the need to more fully explore the ways to better prepare \n\nstudents for post-secondary educational experiences. \n\nEducational Preparation \n\n \n\nTwo national surveys conducted by the Maguire Associates, a higher education market \n\nresearch company, compared views from college faculty members about how high school \n\nteachers prepared their students for the rigor of college work (Sanoff, 2006).  It was reported that \n\n44% of college professors described their students as \u201cnot well prepared for the demands of \n\ncollege level writing\u201d (Sanoff, 2006, p. 1).  Part of the challenge for first-generation college \n\nstudents may be a lack of adequate preparation for college when compared to their continuing \n\ngeneration college student peers (Warburton et al., 2001).  Engle et al. (2006) and Warburton et \n\nal. (2001) found that first-generation college students had a difficult time as they transitioned \n\nfrom high school to college because they were less likely to complete a challenging high school \n\ncurriculum and, as a result, were less academically prepared when beginning their college \n\ncoursework.  College students who did not complete a higher mathematics course, such as pre-\n\ncalculus or calculus, were at greater risk of not graduating with an undergraduate degree (Chen, \n\n2005).  Ishanti (2006) concluded that first-generation college students who completed a \n\n       PREVIEW\fPEER TUTORING AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS \n\n14 \n\n \n\ncompetitive high school curriculum were more likely to graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree than \n\nstudents who did not.   \n\n \n\nEngle and Tinto (2008) referred to data from the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s \n\nBeginning Postsecondary Study (BPS) and found that low-income, first-generation college \n\nstudents were almost four times more likely to drop out after their first year at college compared \n\nto continuing college generation students.  At public, four-year institutions, members of this \n\nstudent population were nearly three times likely to leave after their first year compared to their \n\ncontinuing college generation students.  At private not-for-profit, four-year institutions, the \n\npercentage for this student population who started and were more likely to leave after the first \n\nyear compared to their continuing college generation students were more than five times (Engle \n\n& Tinto, 2008).  While entering and retaining students from the educators' and administrators' \n\npositions are important, they are not the only keys to students' educational success.   \n\nFamily Support \n\nWhile parents of first-generation college students may be supportive of their children\u2019s \n\ndecision to attend college (Dennis et al., 2005), it may be more difficult for these parents to  \n\nunderstand the process of enrolling and applying for financial aid (Choy, 2001).  Choy (2001) \n\nalso found that students from low-income families, with parents who had little college \n\nexperience, were less able to rely on their parents to provide them with assistance about the \n\ncollege process, such as how to apply for college or pay for a college education.  The parents of \n\nthis population, who never attended or graduated from college, may be unable to share or suggest \n\nspecific advice about college after enrollment.  Dennis et al. (2005) conducted a longitudinal \n\nstudy of first-generation college students based on their needs and the support that they received \n\nfrom their peers to adjust to college.  Dennis et al. (2005) found in their results that, \u201cFirst-\n\n       PREVIEW\f", "MARIANNE KORNER and MARTIN HOPF\n\nCROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN PHYSICS: TUTORS, TUTEES,\nAND ACHIEVEMENT IN ELECTRICITY\n\nReceived: 25 October 2013; Accepted: 25 March 2014\n\nABSTRACT. International comparisons reveal\nthat lower-secondary-level students in\nAustria perform below the OECD mean in science. Guided by the search for remedies and\nimprovements in science teaching, this study investigates whether cross-age peer tutoring\nis an appropriate method for teaching physics. A modern and concise definition of peer\ntutoring is available from the review of previous findings which focus on tutors as well as\non tutees. This clarification leads to an experimental setup mostly in tutor\u2013tutee dyads\nwhere a sample of n=172 students from grades 5 to 8 underwent a cross-age peer tutoring\nprocess dealing with different\ntopics within the context of electricity. The overall\nachievement in electricity for this age group was examined in a pretest\u2013posttest design,\nusing test items about electricity. Additionally, analyses were carried out in order to\ninvestigate whether or not there is a correlation between the possible roles within the\nprocess (active tutors\u2013passive tutees) and the overall achievement. The results indicate\nthe active role is a crucial one for the achievement. Finally, a multiple linear\nthat\nregression model is presented which summarizes the research results and estimates the\nposttest scores based on the relevant parameters: the pretest score, the active role within\nthe tutoring process, and the first language.\n\nKEYWORDS: Achievement, Cross-age peer tutoring, Electricity, Physics, Tutee, Tutor\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPeer tutoring, a process where students work together with students, is an\ninteresting and promising approach to teaching. It has been tested in\nvarious academic contexts such as reading, remedial math (Cohen, Kulik\n& Kulik, 1982; Robinson, Schofield & Steers-Wentzell, 2005), computer\nliteracy (Fogarty & Wang, 1982), or thinking skills (Topping & Bryce,\n2004). Additionally, there are studies that reveal encouraging outcomes\nthat peer tutoring is as well an appropriate method for science teaching\n(Howe, Tolmie, Greer & Mackenzie, 1995; Lumpe & Staver, 1995). In\nhis great meta-study, Hattie (2009) certifies peer tutoring quite powerful\noverall effects sizes with d=0.55 where cross-age tutoring is reported to\nbe even more effective.\n\nElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10763-014-\n9539-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nInternational Journal of Science and Mathematics Education (2015) 13: 1039Y1063\n# Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan 2014\n\n\f1040\n\nKORNER & HOPF\n\nWhile some of these studies report about the positive effects on both\nattitudinal and academic outcomes, others refer to positive outcomes for\ntutors as well as tutees. The success of peer tutoring is considered to be\nbased on the effectiveness of social interaction (Fogarty & Wang, 1982;\nLumpe & Staver, 1995). This idea can be traced to Vygotsky for whom\n\u201c... the mechanism of individual developmental change is rooted in\nsociety and culture\u201d (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 7).\n\nOne of the study\u2019s aims is to investigate whether peer tutoring is an\nappropriate method to improve the instructional quality of science\nteaching. In our opinion, the known results cannot easily be transferred\nbecause science teaching has to keep in mind the dominant roles of\nstudents\u2019 misconceptions and that students have to undergo a conceptual\nchange (Duit & Treagust, 2003). Therefore, the peer tutoring interven-\ntions presented in this study are based on certain concepts selected within\na specific context. For this context, we predominantly looked on the\nacademic outcomes by analyzing the achievement before and after the\nintervention. Furthermore, the goal of this project is to link the findings of\neducational research to the demands of instruction in science teaching and\nthus build a bridge between research and practice.\n\nThis study was initiated after the results of PISA 2009 (OECD, 2010)\nrevealed the poor academic achievement of\nlower-secondary-level\nstudents, especially in science. The age of the students who participated\ndiffered widely from kindergarten to upper secondary level. We focus on\nstudents from the lower secondary level (grade 5 to 8, that is age 11 to\n14 years), an age group that is hardly ever an object of research in science\neducation in the context of peer tutoring. In this study, we will present\ncross-age peer tutoring as a method to teach science and evaluate its\noutcomes based on empirical analyses of the students\u2019 achievement in\nelectricity.\n\nPREVIOUS FINDINGS\n\nPeer and Cross-Age Peer Tutoring: Definition\n\nPeer tutoring has a long tradition whose beginnings can be traced back to\nthe ancient Greeks (Topping, 1996). There are various forms of peer\ntutoring and different reasons to practice this method, which results in the\nfact that there is no consistent definition for it in literature. On the one\nhand, for instance, peer tutoring programs were implemented during the\nIndustrial Revolution in England to compensate for the shortage of\n\n\fCROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY\n\n1041\n\nteachers. On the other hand, peer tutoring is also used in order to give\nolder children responsibility for younger ones (Fogarty & Wang, 1982).\nEvidently, the widespread practice of supporting low-achieving students\nthrough private tutoring can also be considered a form of peer tutoring.\nFor our project, we need a modern definition of peer tutoring which\nconsiders the full range of aspects taking place during the tutoring process\nand therefore use Topping (2005): \u201cIt involves people from similar social\ngroupings who are not professional teachers helping each other to learn\nand learning themselves by so doing\u201d (p. 631). This definition already\nindicates a shift of the research focus from tutees toward tutors. To\ndistinguish between peer and cross-age tutoring, we use the following\ndefinition according to Gaustad (1993): \u201cPeer tutoring occurs when tutor\nand tutee are at the same age whereas in cross-age peer tutoring the tutor\nis older than the tutee\u201d (p. 1). Gaustad, however, does not mention how\nmuch older the tutors should be and whether the age corresponds to the\nschool grade. The study by Robinson (2005) recommends that the age\ngap between tutors and tutees should not be too large because their\ninteraction is based on friendship which is closer than the relationship\nbetween a teacher and a student. Sometimes the term peer tutoring is used\nparallel to the broader term peer-assisted learning for both cross-age and\nsame-age tutoring in literature (Robinson et al., 2005). In our study, we\nuse the term cross-age peer tutoring to emphasize that tutors and tutees\ndiffer in grade level but belong to similar social groups concerning type\nof school and social background.\n\nResearch Results About Cross-Age Peer Tutoring\n\nPrevious (meta-)studies on peer tutoring cover a large scale of different\nsettings, different grades, and different subject matters and investigate\neither academic, attitudinal, or socioemotional outcomes. An early meta-\nanalysis conducted by Cohen et al. (1982) compared 65 different studies\nwith different foci using effect sizes. They emphasized positive effects\nconcerning students\u2019 achievements, attitudes toward the subject matter,\nand self-concepts not only for the tutoring students, but for the tutees as\nwell. A majority of studies showed a better examination performance for\ntutored students than for students in conventional classes. The average\neffect size was 0.4 though it was larger for shorter, more structured, cross-\nage, and substitute tutoring programs restricted to basic concepts. Math\ntutoring programs had higher average effect sizes than tutoring programs\nin reading and not clearly described \u201cother.\u201d For tutors, the average effect\nsize in achievement was 0.33. Also, attitudes toward subject matter and\n\n\f1042\n\nKORNER & HOPF\n\nself-concept improved but with moderate to small effect sizes. The range\nof grade levels covered by this meta-study was from one to nine.\n\nA recent meta-analytic review by Rohrbeck et al. (2003) evaluated 90\nstudies about peer-assisted learning in elementary schools. Tutoring\nsessions lasted at least 1 week, and the only limitation on the subject\nmatter was that it had to be academic. The impulse for this meta-study\nwas to search for a remedy for the poor academic outcome of a large\nnumber of U.S. students, especially among vulnerable groups of students\n(i.e. those who belong to minorities or grow up in urban poverty). They\nstate that peer-assisted learning interventions are more effective for\nyounger, urban, low-income, and minority students.\n\nThe review of the literature by Robinson et al. (2005) focused on\nminority students as well, especially on African\u2013American students. The\nage range covered was primary and secondary level, and the subject\nmatter was mainly limited to mathematics. They note that few studies\nfocus on the sometimes surprising academic gains of tutors. These gains\nmay be observed even if\ntutors lacked additional subject matter\ninstruction. Among other results, Robinson et al. state that longer tutoring\nprograms are not necessarily more effective than shorter ones. These\nstudies both criticized the lack of detailed information given about\ndemographic and interventional parameters such as academic level or\ngender composition in some of their reviewed studies.\n\nThere is another older study (Fogarty & Wang, 1982) which focused\non the verbal interactions that take place during the tutoring process and\non learning and attitudinal progress of both tutors and tutees. Their\ntutoring programs covered the subject matters remedial math and\ncomputer literacy with elementary-level students as tutees and interme-\ndiate-level students as tutors. The authors concluded that the success of\ncross-age peer tutoring is based on a give-and-take friendship and\ntherefore qualitatively different from that of a teacher\u2013student interaction.\nIn his review of literature, Topping (1996) reports on the effectiveness\nof peer tutoring in further and higher education. In a summary about\ntrends in peer learning (Topping, 2005), he emphasizes that results are\ntypically very good if peer tutoring is well organized and implemented\nwith focus on appropriate contexts. Then, even in the case of classwide\ntutoring, both tutors and tutees can improve their achievement.\n\nAn independent approach to a similar form of cooperative learning was\ncreated by German didactics in the early 1980s, the so-called Lernen\ndurch Lehren (LdL)\u2014\u201clearning by teaching\u201d (Martin, 1998). There are\nhardly any studies examining the outcomes for science education in this\ncontext. One of these rare studies dealing with physics is a pilot study\n\n\fCROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY\n\n1043\n\nconducted by Zinn (2008, 2009). In his cross-age design, middle school\nstudents (10 years and older) worked with primary and preschool students\non various topics in physics. Zinn emphasizes a significantly increasing\nin physics, especially for female students, and recommends\ninterest\nfurther studies based on fixed learning contents.\n\nImplications from Previous Studies\n\nThe studies mentioned above give some implications for\ntutoring\nprograms concerning age level, duration, or target group. In addition to\nthat, though tutoring programs were originally understood to support the\ntutees\u2019 achievement, they have even more positive effects on the tutors\u2019\nlearning outcomes, which is emphasized by several studies (Fogarty &\nWang, 1982; Robinson et al., 2005; Topping, 1996).\n\nRobinson et al. (2005) discussed some more useful implications for the\ndevelopment of tutoring programs: Peer-assisted learning is a useful\nmethod to enhance both achievement\nin mathematics and attitudinal\noutcomes and need not be limited to high-achieving students as tutors. A\ncombination of the roles of both tutor and tutee should be strongly\nconsidered. Concerning the tutor\u2013tutee combination, the age gap should\nbe modest to maximize the benefit for both groups. Single-sex tutoring\ndyads should also be considered. Fogarty and Wang (1982) emphasized\nthe necessity of prior tutor training because of the tutors\u2019 limited\ninstructional repertoire in the case of new contents.\n\nConceptual Change and Students\u2019 Conceptions\n\nA unique situation is encountered with science education research and\nteaching: The students already have preinstructional conceptions in their\nminds, which originate from everyday life and language often labeled as\nstudents\u2019 conceptions (Duit, 2009; Wandersee, Mintzes, & Novak, 1994).\nThey are partly contradictory to scientific conceptions and thus have to be\nfundamentally restructured during the learning process. This conceptual\nchange has great influence on the way science is supposed to be taught.\nConceptual change is not facilitated by just making students aware of\ntheir preinstructional conceptions, for they are usually very stable (Duit,\nTreagust, & Widodo, 2008). The best known approach to conceptual\nchange is from Strike and Posner (1992) who claim four conditions that\nto facilitate this change: students\u2019\nneed to be fulfilled in order\ndissatisfaction with their prior concepts and a replacement conception\nwhich is intelligible, plausible, and fruitful (Duit & Treagust, 2003).\n\n\f1044\n\nKORNER & HOPF\n\nTherefore, it is necessary to create appropriate learning settings which\nsupport conceptual change in order to enable students to actively\nconstruct knowledge within the scope of the constructivist\nlearning\ntheory (Reusser, 2001). In their research about peer collaboration in\nphysics Howe et al. (1995) report that peer tutoring facilitates conceptual\nchange in the context of heating and cooling and can therefore be seen as\nan appropriate environment setting in the sense of Reusser (see above).\n\nRESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nDuring the past few decades, a lot of research has been done on peer\ntutoring and other methods of cooperative learning (Treagust, 2007) with\nregard to various topics and different age groups. Although there are\nseveral studies about peer tutoring, there is one question that has not been\nsufficiently answered by recent research: Is this method also effective in\nthe context of teaching physics? The answer to this question is not\nobvious because instruction in physics requires specific features in order\nto facilitate conceptual change on the basis of a constructivist learning\ntheory. The abovementioned (meta-)studies deal with many different\nsubjects, such as mathematics, reading, or computer literacy. Science\ntopics are hardly covered explicitly in any study except that of Howe et\nal. (1995). Duit et al. (2008) propose that, based on a multi-perspective\nconceptual change approach, self-guided learning strategies support\nconstructivist-oriented learning in science in a more suitable way than\nthe traditional teacher-oriented instructional practice. This can be seen as\nan argument for the effectiveness of cross-age peer tutoring in the context\nof physics. Therefore, this study examines the achievement in the tested\ncontexts in order to draw possible conclusions for the effectiveness of\ncross-age peer tutoring. However, caution should be exercised because\ntutees might possibly adopt their tutor\u2019s misconceptions. Consequently,\nthese misconceptions might be even more ingrained.\n\nFurthermore, there are few studies which examine secondary-level\nstudents in the context of peer-assisted learning. Robinson\u2019s meta-study\n(Robinson et al., 2005), as well as Rohrbeck\u2019s meta-study (Rohrbeck, et\nal., 2003), describe predominantly U.S. minority and at-risk students.\nAdditionally, Rohrbeck claims that peer-tutoring interventions were more\neffective with younger elementary school students. Therefore, it is left\nopen whether this method is appropriate in the European cultural context\nas well as for secondary-level students. One of the implications made in\nRobinson\u2019s study was to take into account that tutoring programs have\n\n\fCROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY\n\n1045\n\npositive academic outcomes for tutors as well. Accordingly, not only the\ntutees\u2019, but also the tutors\u2019, achievement has became one of our research\ngoals.\n\nThe present study focuses on electricity because, according to the\nAustrian curricula, this topic is relevant for all of the participating classes.\nAlso, students\u2019 preconceptions in electricity are well-known (Stork &\nWiesner, 1981) and research on conceptual change teaches us to focus on\nspecific conceptions. Thus,\nthis study was guided by the following\nresearch questions:\n\nResearch Question 1: What Is the Achievement in Electricity for Secondary-\nLevel Students According to Cross-Age Peer Tutoring?\n\nThis investigation aims to find evidence whether or not cross-age peer\ntutoring is an appropriate method for teaching electricity to secondary-\nlevel students who are rarely covered by previous studies. The tested\nhypothesis is that an achievement in electricity can be observed for all\nsecondary-level students within the context of electricity.\n\nResearch Question 2: Is There an Increased Achievement in Electricity\nfor Tutors?\n\nOlder studies have reported that there is a considerable benefit not only\ntor tutees but also for those students who act as tutors (Cohen et al., 1982;\nFogarty & Wang, 1982; Topping, 1996). Therefore, our hypothesis\ncontains a considerable benefit for tutors in the context of electricity.\n\nResearch Question 3: What Are the Differences in Achievement in the Posttests\ndue to the Three Different Roles (Tutor, Tutee, Both) that Students\nHad During the Tutoring Process?\n\nIf an overall achievement in electricity can be found, further analysis will\nbe needed. The hypothesis, deduced from results of previous studies\nthere are\n(Cohen et al., 1982; Hattie, 2009; Topping, 1996),\ndifferences in the achievement between these three groups. Comparisons\nbetween the groups will be conducted by planned contrast analyses.\nAnother point of interest concerns possible effects due to the treatment\u2019s\ndifferent durations for the subgroups. According to the existing literature\n(Robinson et al., 2005), no such effects are expected. Therefore, the\nresearch hypothesis is that there are no differences in the achievement due\nto the treatment\u2019s different durations.\n\nis that\n\n\f1046\n\nKORNER & HOPF\n\nResearch Question 4: What Are Relevant Predictors to Estimate the Posttest\nScores?\n\nThe idea is to create a model by means of multiple linear regression\n(MLR) that estimates the posttest scores of students after cross-age peer\ntutoring. On one hand, this model summarizes the results from research\nquestions 1 to 3. On the other hand, the relevance and the individual\ncontribution of the pretest and the role as well as the demographic\nparameters gender,\nthe\nachievement in electricity are also examined. Our hypothesis is that first\nlanguage and gender influence the outcomes, whereas the grades in\nregular classes do not contribute to the posttest scores.\n\nlanguage, and grade in physics for\n\nfirst\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN\n\nDescription of the Sample\n\nThis study was conducted in Austrian schools in and around Vienna\nwithin the context of a larger project on Cross-Age Peer Tutoring in\nPhysics (CAPT). For the whole project, the age of the children and\nstudents ranged from 5 years (kindergarten) up to 17 years (upper\nsecondary level). According to the research questions, in this study, we\nconfined ourselves to students aged 11 to 14 years, which corresponds\nwith grades 5 to 8. This restriction results in a total sample size of n=172\nstudents investigated. The questionnaires used were optimized for this\nspecific age group. The grade level for the tutors was 6 to 8 (ages 12 to\n14) and that of the tutees was 2 to 7 (ages 8 to 13) resulting in an average\nage gap of 2.82 years and a standard deviation of 1.99. In two cases, the\nage gap was 0 years (same-age tutoring, but different types of schools),\nand in one case, when tutees were in kindergarten,\nit was 6 years.\nAccording to Robinson et al. (2005) and Fogarty & Wang (1982), the age\ngap between tutors and tutees should not be too large, which is the case in\nmost situations. Beyond that, hardly anything is found in previous studies\nabout the influence of the age gap. A gap of 0 years, which means same-\nage tutoring, at most reduces the observed effect sizes (Hattie, 2009) but\ndoes not bias the analyses in any other way.1\n\nDue to organizational reasons, it was not possible to draw a more\nhomogenous sample. Therefore, the circumstances of the project made it\nnecessary to conduct a field study.\n\nThe analyses of the pretests showed that, based on this sample, it was\nstill possible to answer the research questions because these tests did not\n\n\fCROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY\n\n1047\n\nvary significantly over all participating classes. The focus on lower-\nsecondary-level students was chosen because the sample size of upper\nsecondary-level students was too small.\n\nThe most important criterion that participating classes had to meet was that\ncross-age peer tutoring could be accomplished without too much organizational\neffort. Thus, four schools were selected in which different types of schools were\nlocated within the same building. Besides this criterion, the four schools were\nchosen in order to get the most representative sample possible. School 1 is a\nprivate school in the center of Vienna, attended by hardly any students with\nmigration background; the second one is a public school, located also in the\ncenter of Vienna, with classes of up to 90 % students with migration\nbackground, according to the definition of OECD (Breit, 2009). The third one\nis a private school as well, but is located at the periphery of the city. The\nparticipating teachers of all three schools were involved in the training of the\npreservice teachers. The fourth school is situated in a more rural environment,\n20 km outside of Vienna. All in all, there were seven urban classes and six rural\nclasses. However, we tried to include different types of schools with different\nsociocultural backgrounds. The reader can claim that the sample is biased\nbecause of the overrepresentation of private schools, but we would like to\nmention that, in Austria, all schools follow the same curriculum and all teachers,\nin private as well as in public schools, are equally paid by the community.\n\nMost of the classes chosen for this study belonged to a type of\ncompulsory school which qualifies their students for a job rather than for\nhigher education such as colleges and universities. Therefore,\nthe\nattending students\u2019 abilities in science, mathematics, and reading are\nsignificantly below the mean for this age group (OECD, 2010).\n\nAlthough there is evidence found in literature, as reported above, that\ncross-age peer tutoring works in various situations, it might be different\nand more difficult when trying to induce conceptual change. If it is\npossible that cross-age peer tutoring enhances the achievement and thus\ninitiates a conceptual change in the tested low-achieving population, it is\nlikely to work even better for different populations of higher-achieving\nstudents.\n\nAll students tested and monitored, as well as their parents, had given\n\ntheir informed written consent.\n\nSubject Matter\n\nFollowing Zinn (2009), we based the interventions on fixed learning\ncontents. According to literature (Duit & Rho\u0308neck, 1998; Shipstone,\n1984), we selected basic topics within the context of electricity. The\n\n\f1048\n\nKORNER & HOPF\n\ninterventions and the learning materials had been designed based on\nresearch about students\u2019 conceptions and instructional\nfindings of\nstrategies (Shaffer & McDermott, 1992). For each class, there was a\nspecific plan about which students\u2019 conceptions would be addressed\ndepending on the students\u2019 grade level. The learning materials were\nselected accordingly. The main students\u2019 conceptions that were addressed\nincluded the following: electric circuits must be closed; current has a\ncertain direction; current is constant; and there is a connection between\ncurrent, resulting resistance, and the brightness of equal bulbs. The\nresulting resistance in parallel and series circuits was also discussed. For\nthe instruction of primary students by secondary-level students, the main\nfocus was on the basic concept that electric circuits have to be closed.\n\nDespite the fact that the interventions took place at different times of\nthe year and at different grade levels, we asked the regular class teachers\nnot to give the students previous or additional instructions in electricity.\nThis seems crucial, especially during the time between the tutor training\nand the tutoring. There was only one class that already had instruction in\nthis subject matter 1 year earlier. As a precursor to the results, this class\ndid not perform significantly better in the pretest anyway.\n\nMentoring and Tutoring\n\nthe tutors were trained in a so-called\nBefore the tutoring sessions,\nmentoring. According to Fogarty and Wang (1982), it makes sense to do\nthis if the subject matter is completely new to both the tutors and the\ntutees. Each mentoring was conducted by the same researcher involved in\nthe project. A mentoring has to fulfill several purposes. First of all, the\nsoon-to-be tutors should become familiar with the subject matter and the\nassociated scientific concepts (which in some cases will be contrary to\ntheir own). Secondly, the students get the opportunity to realize and to\nreflect on their own conceptions in order to construct new ones which\nmatch the scientific ones. This helps the tutors in their ability to monitor\nthe tutees\u2019 conceptions, to regard these conceptions as a basis of the\nlearning process, and to find a way to reconstruct them in order to lead to\nscientifically correct\nideas. Another aspect of the mentoring is that\nstudents get involved in the preparation and selection of suitable learning\nmaterials for their teaching purposes. Tutors were asked to base their\ninstructions on certain student conceptions.\n\nFor the mentoring, the tutors received a list containing a variety of\ntasks and suggested experiments (materials available in German only on\nour webpage\u2014reference hidden due to blind review process). Addition-\n\n\fCROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY\n\n1049\n\nally, they were provided experimental materials such as bulbs, wires,\nbatteries, and small electric motors.\n\nFirstly, tutors started with completing these tasks2 on their own or in a\ndyad with their neighbor. Students were asked to predict the possible\nresult, then to observe the experiment and finally explain the observed\nresults according to the POE strategy (White & Gunstone, 1992). The\nfollowing group discussion was moderated by the researcher. The correct\nanswer as well as possible misconceptions was discussed. The discussion\nabout the students\u2019 own misconceptions is seen as a fruitful basis to\nprepare them for their tutees\u2019 conceptions.\n\nAfterwards, students were asked to select those tasks and experiments\nthat, in their opinion, were most suitable for the tutoring with respect to\nthe tutees\u2019 grade level. It was even possible for the tutors to invent new\nexercises or experiments, if they matched their teaching purposes. This\nwas accomplished in few cases. With regard to the students\u2019 motivation,\nthey were told that from that moment on they were the experts for\nteaching the younger students. Due to the timetables in the individual\nschools, the duration of the mentoring varied from 60 to 80 min. It took\nplace 2 to 3 weeks prior to the tutoring.\n\nJust before the tutoring itself took place, the soon-to-be tutors practiced\nanother 20 to 30 min for the tutoring session. They prepared their\nexperimental materials and also received cue cards to scaffold the tutoring\nprocess. These cue cards included questions and experiments they had\nselected for their tutees. Finally, there was a brief instruction on how to\nteach. We told the tutors that they are not supposed to do everything\nthemselves, but rather to have the tutees create their own experiences.\nTheir instructions should be based on the POE strategy as well.\n\nThe tutoring started with the distribution of experimental materials like\nbatteries, bulbs, and cables. In addition, the tutors also received their cue\ncards including exercises, questions, or experiments. These were the\nexercises they had selected at the end of the mentoring for their teaching\npurposes. As a little hint in case a tutor forgot the correct answer, there\nwere keywords on the back of each card. The whole tutor class and the\nwhole tutee class met in a classroom; therefore, we call it classwide\ntutoring. We preferred the more intense one-to-one setting. So, each\nstudent of the tutor class instructed one student of the tutee class. In some\nrare cases, when the number of students in the classes differed, it was\nnecessary that two tutors worked with one tutee or the other way around.\nThe tutor\u2013tutee dyads were assigned randomly. Therefore, the tutor\u2013tutee\npairs were coeducational because in Austria it is not common to have\nsingle-sex classes and gender aspects do not cover the research focus.\n\n\f1050\n\nKORNER & HOPF\n\nMoreover, we operated on a cross-ability basis. It was not intended that\nthe tutor group consisted solely of gifted students and that tutees were\nunderachievers or at-risk students.\n\nThe tutors started the intervention by asking the tutees about the tasks\nand inviting them to probe their assumptions by experiment. This process\nshould lead to further discussions.\n\nThe actual instructing process lasted for 30 to 45 min, depending on\nthe students\u2019 eagerness. Tutoring was stopped when either the time ran\nout or the students reported that\nthey have completed all exercises,\nexperiments, and discussions.\n\nA typical sequence of mentoring and tutoring for a tutor-only group\n(class A) and a tutee-only group (class B) is shown in Fig. 1. Class A\nreceived a mentoring and then the tutoring took place. Three of the\nclasses (type A) had an additional tutoring with another class.\n\nAnother typical setting is shown in Fig. 2. Students of class B switched\nroles and first acted as tutees and then as tutors following mentoring 2.\nThus, class B received a tutoring and a mentoring and ran another\ntutoring.\n\nOne may claim that the classes spent differing times on tasks and,\ntherefore, their achievement in the posttest would be different. While Hattie\n(2009, p. 184) explains that the quality of learning is essential, the influence\nof the time on a task is less than average. Cohen et al. (1982) and Robinson et\nal. (2005) report that shorter programs are more effective, presuming them to\nbe more structured. Our tutoring program is perceived to be highly structured\nand thus effective, and the influence of the time on a task, on the other hand,\nis subordinate. This matches preliminary results from MLR where the time of\nintervention, which does not mirror the quality of intervention, did not turn\nout to be a significant predictor.\n\nAchievement in Electricity\nFor this study, we preferred a pretest\u2013posttest design rather than compare\ntreatment with control groups. This was done because it seemed a priori\nimpossible to tell which parameters are relevant and thus had to be controlled.\n\nFig. 1. Sequence of mentoring and tutoring\n\n\fCROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY\n\n1051\n\nFig. 2. Mentoring and tutoring with switching roles\n\nFor the tutor-only group and the tutee\u2013tutor group, the pretest was conducted\nimmediately before the mentoring and after the (second) tutoring. For the tutee-\nonly group, the testing points were before and after the tutoring. Regular class\nteachers were asked to give no additional instruction to the students before the\nmentoring and between mentoring and tutoring in order not to bias the effects of\ncross-age peer tutoring. Except for one class, all classes had had no previous\ninstruction in electricity.\n\nThe test instrument used in this study was a multiple choice conceptual\nknowledge test which was developed on the basis of the test of Rho\u0308neck\n(1986) and on DIRECT\u2014Determining and Interpreting Resistive Electric\nCircuit Concepts Test\u2014by Engelhardt and Beichner (2004). It is based on\nstudents\u2019 conceptions mainly using two-tiered items (Urban-Woldron &\nHopf, 2012). On the first tier, students have to answer a certain question,\ne.g. \u201cHow bright will the bulbs in the figure be?\u201d In the second tier, they\ntick an explanation for why they had chosen a certain answer. The\ndistractors in this test were based on previous interviews with students\nabout their conceptions in electricity.\n\nWe selected the first five items of this test which corresponded to the\nstudents\u2019 conceptions addressed in the tutoring process. Due to the brief\nintervention and the limited number of students\u2019 conceptions addressed,\nthe items were counted as sum scores.\n\nStudents were asked to complete the tests on their own as accurately as\nthe test was anonymous and had no\npossible. They were told that\nthem that\ninfluence on their grades. It was also important\nresearchers were not interested in their individual performance but in\nhow well cross-age peer\ntutoring works as a teaching method.\nObservations during the data collection showed that students were very\nhonest and eager while filling out the test items.\n\nto tell\n\nRESULTS\n\nBefore reporting the results, we want to clarify two details about the\nanalyses: Single missing values in the knowledge test were interpreted as\n\n\f1052\n\nKORNER & HOPF\n\nnot known. If a whole questionnaire was missing, this was interpreted as\nstudent was absent. Concerning the reliability of the knowledge tests on\nelectricity, Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 for the pretest was found to be .78 and, for the\nposttest, \u03b1=.85.\n\nSample Characteristics\n\nthe characteristics of the sample are described as\nIn the following,\naccurately as possible in order\nto build the basis of comparable\nconclusions. This is also done because, at first glance, the sample seems\nto be rather inhomogeneous regarding the wide range of grades (5 to 8).\nThe total number of students investigated was n=172. There were\n62 % boys and 38 % girls. The ratio of boys to girls is representative for\nthis type of school in Austria. This ratio was not supposed to be of\nimportance, but we had to be more careful with the\nstatistical\ninterpretation of the results according to research question 4. There were\nnine secondary-level classes involved in this project. Regarding the\ndifferent roles, the distribution was 94 tutors-only (55 %), 43 tutees\u2013tutors\n(25 %), and 35 tutees-only (20 %). For 68 % of the students, their first\nlanguage was the same as the language of instruction (German), and 32 %\nhad a different first language. The grades of the students who were\nactually tested in this study ranged from 6 to 8 (M=6.47, SD=0.501).\n\nSince the classes participating in the study appeared to be diverse, the first\nimportant thing was to find out their preinstructional knowledge in electricity. In\norder to do this, the pretest scores were compared in an attempt to find out\nwhether classes differ significantly in their pretests. This hypothesis had to be\nrejected, because ANOVA shows no significant difference between the classes\n(p=.489; F(8,163)=0.936). Therefore, the classes had apparently been drawn\nfrom the same population although they differed in grade and social background\nand one of them had already had previous instruction in electricity prior to the\nstudy. The homogeneity of the sample in the pretest scores builds the essential\nbasis for the interpretation of the posttest scores.\n\nAnother question concerning the assignment of the tutor and tutee roles\nto the classes was that of randomness. It might have happened that classes\nwith better-performing students were primarily suggested for tutoring by\ntheir class teachers. In this case, ANOVA again shows no significant\ndifferences in the pretest scores for the three groups tutor-only, tutee\u2013\ntutor, and tutee-only (p =.113; F2,169=2.205) so that\ntherefore the\nassignment can be considered random.\n\nIn order to answer research question 1, the pretests and posttests of all\nstudents were compared. In this first analysis, we did not distinguish\n\n\fCROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY\n\n1053\n\nbetween roles (Table 1). Analyses therefore represent the intraindividual\ngain in knowledge. Both tests were available from n=164 students.\nPretests as well as posttests were rated as sum scores, with a maximum\nscore of 9 points. As described above, we expected observable gains in\nelectricity.\nThe t\n\ntest on the paired differences (Table 2) indicates a highly\nsignificant difference between the mean scores of pre- and posttests\nwithin the population (t163=5.826, pG.001). The overall effect size due to\nthe treatment is 0.46 with a statistical power of .99.\n\nIn order to find an answer to research question 2, the investigated sample\nwas reduced to those students who acted as tutors-only. Those who acted in\nthe tutee\u2013tutor role were not taken into account yet, in order to distinguish\nbetween the results according to the tutoring process and the duration of the\ntreatment. The comparison of the two active groups was carried out in the\nanalyses related to research question 3. The number of tutors for whom pre-\nand posttests were available shrank from n=94 to n=91 because of student\nabsences during either pre- or posttest. The sum scores of pre- and posttests\nfor this subgroup were compared. A t test on paired samples indicated a\nhighly significant gain for tutors (t90=3.976; pG.001) within the population\nwith an overall effect size of 0.41 and a statistical power of .95.\n\nAs explained in the description of the sample, there are no significant\ndifferences in the pretests according to the classes and to the role\nassignment. The following analysis, according to research question 3,\ntested whether there are differences in the posttest scores if the sample is\nsplit up by the roles.\n\nThis was done by an ANOVA.3 Additionally, analyses were carried\nout based on different assumptions for the reasons of possible differences\nin the posttests. Regarding the results from literature, it could be expected\nthat the role is the only parameter which splits the sample into differing\nsubgroups. Neither the grade level nor the affiliation to a certain class\nreveals significant differences in the posttests.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nDescriptive statistics of pre- and posttests\n\nPaired-samples statistics\n\nPair 1\n\nPretest\nPosttest\n\nMean\n\n4.41\n5.84\n\nN\n\n164\n164\n\nSD\n\n2.59\n2.85\n\n\f1054\n\nPaired-samples test\n\nKORNER & HOPF\n\nTABLE 2\n\nComparison of pretest with posttest\n\nPaired differences\n\nMean\n\nSD\n\nT\n\ndf\n\nSig.

Figure 3 displays the mean posttest scores due to the\nstudents\u2019 roles including a 95 % confidence interval.\n\nFurther analyses by planned contrasts were carried out to find out more\ndetails about the differences. The most interesting contrast appeared when\nstudents who took part in the active role (tutor-only, tutee\u2013tutor) were\ncompared to those in the passive role (tutee-only). T statistics showed the\nsignificance of this contrast indicating a much better performance for the\nactive group in the posttests (t49.8=3.320; p=.002).\n\nA point that has not been answered sufficiently by these analyses is\nwhether or not the duration of the treatment has an effect on the outcome.\nThe tested hypothesis was based on the assumption that students who took\npart in the active and the passive role had spent more time on the subject\nmatter than those in a single role. This could influence their achievement. For\nthis analysis, a planned contrast compared the two subgroups tutor-only and\ntutee\u2013tutor. T statistics showed no significance of this contrast (t162=\u22121.461;\np=.146), which implies that there is no effect due to the duration of the\ntreatment in the population. This means that a longer treatment does not\nnecessarily lead to better performance in the posttest.\n\nturned out\n\nThe predictors that\n\nto be significant from the above\nanalyses, i.e. pretest score and role, were selected for a MLR to sum up\nthe results from the analyses above, to tell about the predictors\u2019 individual\ncontributions, and thus to construct a model for the students\u2019 posttest\nscores (research question 4). Additionally, new predictors, based on the\ntheoretical framework, were entered into the model. Several models had\nbeen tested in an attempt to estimate the values of the posttest scores by\nthe simplest one, which shows the highest amount of variation in the\nposttest scores that is accounted for by the model.\n\n\fCROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY\n\n1055\n\nFig. 3. Mean posttest scores and 95 % confidence interval according to the three roles.\nThe circles indicate the mean, and the bars, the confidence interval\n\nIn order to get a first impression concerning the influence of the\ndemographic variables, Pearson correlations with regard to posttest scores\nwere tested (Table 3). The only correlation which is significant, besides\nthe pretest score and the active role (represented by the variable tutor;\ncoded with 1 for both tutor-only and tutee\u2013tutor, coded with 0 for tutees),\nis the first language (coded with 1 if the instructional language (German)\nis the same as the first language, else 0): The correlation between first\nlanguage and the posttest score is r=.182 with p=.015.\n\nThe correlation of posttest scores to gender showed that being a girl\n(coded with 1) means having a slightly, but not significantly, lower\nposttest score. The last grades correlate significantly with the posttest\nscores. The correlation is negative because in Austria \u201c1\u201d is the highest\ngrade and \u201c5\u201d is the lowest one. There are, however, as demonstrated\nlater, good reasons to exclude the last grade from MLR because\nfrequency distributions show that 70 % of the students had grades \u201c1\u201d\nor \u201c2\u201d (the best ones). This indicates that this variable does not account\nmuch for the variance in the posttest. According to the results of\ncorrelation analyses, the variables were entered simultaneously into MLR\n\n\fKORNER & HOPF\n\nTABLE 3\n\nPearson correlations to posttest score\n\n1056\n\nVariable\n\nPretest score\nTutor\nFirst language\nGender\nLast grade\n\nr\n\n.426***\n.309***\n.182*\n\u2212.069\n\u2212.151*\n\n*pG.01; **pG.005; ***pG.001\n\nby the method forced entry. Table 4 shows the summary of four different\nMLR models displaying constants and standardized coefficients beta.\n\nModel 3 is the preferred one because it includes relevant parameters\nis the simplest model with the highest\ndeduced from theory and it\nadjusted R2. Also, it explains approximately 25 % of the variance. All\nincluded predictors are significant, and the statistical power of .34\nindicates a rather strong effect (Buehner & Ziegler, 2009).\n\nModel 4 includes the additional independent variables gender and last\ngrade without increasing R2 and thus explaining more of the effects of\ntutoring. The variable first language loses significance because it is highly\nsignificantly correlated to last grade (r=\u2212.493; pG.001). Although model\n4 is not the best, we mention it here because it shows that neither the last\ngrade in physics nor gender has significant influence on the outcomes of\ncross-age peer tutoring. This point seems to be interesting with regard to\nfurther implementation of this method in regular classes.\n\nTABLE 4\n\nSummary of different MLR models\n\nModel\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nConstant\nPretest score\nTutor\nFirst language\nGender\nLast grade\nN\nAdjusted R2\nF stat\nEffect size\n\n3.808***\n0.426***\n\n2.327**\n0.379***\n0.232***\n\n142\n.175\n30.970***\n0.21\n\n142\n.222\n21.104***\n0.29\n\n1.428*\n0.360***\n0.263**\n0.195**\n\n142\n.254\n17.004***\n0.34\n\n2.234**\n0.349***\n0.281***\n0.141*\n\u22120.048\n\u22120.103\n142\n.253\n10.573***\n0.34\n\n*pG.01; **pG.005; ***pG.001\n\n\fCROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY\n\n1057\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nif necessary. ANOVA shows clearly that\n\nThe inferences made within this study are based on the idea that the\nsample is drawn from the same population. First of all, this assumption\nhas to be made plausible because the available sample varied over a\ncertain range of grade levels and first languages and it included different\nage gaps. Although it would have been better to have more precise\nconditions, field research has to be flexible enough to handle such a\nvariety,\ninferences to the\npopulation can be drawn on the assumption of homogeneity in the tested\nparameters. For the content knowledge variable pretest, this might be a\nsurprising result because, as reported above, one of the classes had had\ninstruction in electricity based on the regular curriculum a year before the\nstudy. This class was expected to perform significantly better in the\npretest, but it did not. This finding underpins the well-known results of\nresearch (Duit & Treagust, 2003) that render science teaching ineffective\nunless teachers explicitly focus on students\u2019 conceptions and thus\nconceptual change.\n\nStatistical tests carried out in order to answer research question 1 show\ntwo things. The first is that there is an enhanced achievement in electricity\nfor secondary-level students. This age group has not been covered in\nprevious studies. Results from these studies describe positive effects of\npeer and cross-age peer tutoring mainly for younger or elder students. The\npresent study closes this gap. With an effect size of 0.46, this effect,\naccording to the standards in research, is estimated to be a medium effect\n(Cohen, 1988; Ha\u0308u\u00dfler, Bu\u0308nder, Duit, Gra\u0308ber, & Mayer, 1998). In our\ncase, this is regarded as satisfactory considering the rather short duration\nof the intervention of approximately 1 h.\n\nthis result\n\nThe second finding is that an enhanced achievement in physics is\nobservable for this age group. Concerning the special situation in physics\nindicates that cross-age peer tutoring supports\nteaching,\nconceptual change and therefore leads to higher achievement\nin the\nposttest. Perhaps the detailed mechanisms of how this conceptual change\ntakes place and what the role of cross-age peer tutoring within this\nprocess actually is could be investigated further by means of qualitative\nresearch.\n\nThe analyses above give an overview of the effects of tutoring but do\nin.\nnot differentiate between the different\nTherefore, further analyses were carried out in order to investigate the\nrelation of outcome and role. According to the results of previous studies,\nit was recommended to focus on the tutors\u2019 outcomes (Fogarty & Wang,\n\nroles students took part\n\n\f1058\n\nKORNER & HOPF\n\n1982; Robinson et al., 2005; Topping, 1996). With an effect size of 0.41,\nthe effect of cross-age peer tutoring on the tutors\u2019 posttest scores (when\ncompared to the pretest scores) is slightly smaller than the overall effect,\nbut still satisfying. The reason for the smaller effect size might very likely\nbe the smaller sample (n=92) since this analysis was carried out with\nstudents of the group tutor-only (not including the group tutee\u2013tutor) in\norder to avoid the influence of possible dose effects. This result does not\nthe tutors\u2019 outcomes in\nonly confirm what has been reported about\nliterature (Fogarty & Wang, 1982; Robinson et al., 2005; Topping, 1996),\nbut also extends these results to physics instruction at the secondary level.\nThe knowledge gain for tutors as a result of the tutoring process seems\ninteresting when planning further implementations of this method in\nregular classes and regular teaching. Considering the beliefs of the\nteachers who participated in this study, the knowledge gain was expected\nto be solely on the tutees\u2019 side; the tutors were supposed to be at a\ndisadvantage because of the time needed for tutoring. Therefore, an open\nquestion was what to offer tutors in order to compensate them for their\ninvolvement. These teachers\u2019 beliefs can clearly be rebutted by our\nresearch, which shows a knowledge gain and thus a benefit for tutors as\nwell. Their benefit lies in learning by teaching and thus improving their\nown abilities. Altogether,\nin the\ntutoring process. What exactly happens cannot be answered in detail with\nthis research design and might be a topic for further investigation.\n\nthe active role seems to be crucial\n\nWhat has been left open until now is a more detailed analysis of where\nthe differences in the posttests come from. Comparing the posttests of the\nthree different groups (tutors,\ntutees, both), ANOVA is significant.\nHowever, ANOVAs were not significant when proving different factors\nthat could have affected the posttests. Thus, there is a sample whose\nperformance is homogenous in the pretests. All students showed\nimproved performance in the posttest. The investigations of the posttest\nrevealed that students\u2019 achievements differed highly significantly if the\nsample was split up by the factor role. This is underpinned by literature\n(e.g. Robinson et al., 2005) and by the analyses according to research\nquestion 2. All additional factors tested did not split the sample into\nhighly significantly differing subgroups.\n\nFurther analyses were carried out by theory-based planned contrasts\nrather than by post hoc tests because there were already strong hints that\nthe active role is the more powerful one. Figure 3 also indicates that the\ndifferences can be found between the active (tutor-only and tutee\u2013tutor)\nand the passive role (tutee-only). Statistical computations revealed that\nthis contrast, in fact, showed the most powerful statistics (t49.8=3.320;\n\n\fCROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY\n\n1059\n\np=.002). Therefore, we infer that the posttests showed highly significant\ndifferences insofar that tutors and tutee\u2013tutors in their active roles were\nmore affected by the treatment than the passive tutees.\n\nThe active group itself contains two differently treated subgroups, the\ntutor-only group and the tutee\u2013tutor group. They might differ because the\ntutor-only and tutee\u2013tutor groups spent different times on the subject\nmatter (compare Fig. 1 to Fig. 2). Considering Robinson et al. (2005), no\nsuch dose\u2013effect relations are expected. In fact,\nt statistics were not\nsignificant in testing this contrast (t162=\u22121.461; p=.146). This can be\ninterpreted to mean that the effect of tutoring does not depend on its\nduration. This result may not be surprising since the same students\u2019\nconceptions were addressed in nearly every mentoring or tutoring.\nPerhaps there would have been an effect\ntogether with a longer\nintervention, more conceptions had been addressed. This was not the case\nbut may be of interest for further research.\n\nif,\n\nMultiple linear regressions were carried out\n\nin order to estimate\nposttest scores as best as possible and to quantify the entered predictors\u2019\ncontribution. Based on correlation analyses, the parameters shown in\nTable 3 have been put in by the method \u201center.\u201d Model number 3 shows a\nsmall constant (1.428). The constant gives the estimated posttest score\nindependent of the pretest, the role, or the first language, and therefore,\nmodels with small constants are preferred. The additional gains can be\nexplained by the predictors pretest, tutor, and first language. Comparing\nmodel 3 to model 4, the variable first language loses significance when\nthe variable last grade is entered. Still, the last grade in physics seems to\nbe a consequence of the first language and not the other way around.\nTherefore, first language is regarded as the more powerful predictor. The\nintrinsically interesting thing indicated by model 4 is that gender does not\nsignificantly influence the estimated posttest score. Considering the\nreported low interest of girls in physics, this result is in effect pleasing,\nthough we should be careful with the interpretation because the boys were\noverrepresented in this sample.\n\nFinally, MLR allows us to estimate the posttest score for different\n\ntypes of students (Table 5):\n\nCase 2, for example, displays that the student\u2019s pretest score was 7\npoints, the student acted as tutor (tutor=1), and his first language was\nGerman (coded 1). The score of his posttest estimated by model 3 is 8.1.\nWhereas, case 6 describes a student with the same pretest score (7) and\nrole (tutor=1), but the first language is not German, meaning it is not\nthe language of instruction. For this case, the estimated score of the\nposttest is 7.2.\n\n\f1060\n\nKORNER & HOPF\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nin all,\n\nthis study supports previously accepted outcomes from\nAll\nliterature on peer and cross-age peer tutoring. Moreover, it closes the\ngap in research regarding the age level, as our study extends findings to\nthe age group of secondary-level students. Another important point is that\nall tests carried out within this study show knowledge gains in physics.\nThis is not a priori clear because teaching physics appears to be an\nespecially demanding situation, which requires opportunities to facilitate a\nconceptual change. The results indicate that cross-age peer tutoring\nprovides an appropriate learning environment to learn physics. Moreover,\nthe findings reveal that the active role is the crucial one in the context of\nachievement. Considering the different sequences within the tutoring\nprocess, no effects on the duration on the outcome could be found.\n\nOur MLR demonstrates that relevant parameters that explain the\nincrease in achievement in electricity turned out to be the pretest, the role,\nand the first language. Based on these results, it will be interesting for\nfurther studies to compare classes instructed by the cross-age peer\ntutoring method to conventional ones.\n\nEffects on attitudinal outcomes like motivation or the correlations of\nattitudinal and cognitive outcomes have not been covered by this work.\nThe finding that there are no dose effects in the achievement does not\nnecessarily mean that there are no effects in the attitudinal outcomes. This\nshould be the subject of further analyses.\n\nAnother open question concerns the intrinsic mechanism of how the\nconceptual change takes place or what exactly happens during the\ntutoring process. This question is likely to be answered by additional\nqualitative research to support the quantitative findings. Another possible\napproach is to control the tutor\u2013tutee assignments and accurately monitor\n\nTABLE 5\n\nEstimated posttest scores for different pretest scores, roles, and first languages\n\nCase\n\nPretest\n\nTutor\n\nFirst language\n\nModel 3\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n1\n7\n7\n1\n1\n7\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n3.4\n8.1\n5.7\n5.8\n5.0\n7.2\n\n\fCROSS-AGE PEER TUTORING IN ELECTRICITY\n\n1061\n\nit\n\nthe students\u2019 conceptions, which has not yet been done by the present\nresearch. Many questions concerning conceptual change cannot be\nanswered sufficiently by this kind of research. There are hints that this\nis left open what exactly supports the\nmethod facilitates it, but\nconceptual change and how it takes place within the tutoring process.\nThe overrepresentation of boys in the sample does not affect\nthe\nresearch questions, but inference from MLR has to be done carefully.\nHowever, results indicate that gender has no significant influence on the\noutcomes of the peer tutoring process. In order to underpin these results,\nsingle-sex dyads in a sample where the ratio of boys to girls is\napproximately the same should be considered.\n\nAll in all, we regard this study as a contribution to the present research\non learning environments in the sense of constructivist learning theories\nthat support learning in science. Still, there is much work left to identify\nthe mechanisms of how exactly it works.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis study was funded by Sparkling Science (number of project deleted\ndue to review process)\u2014a program of the Austrian Federal Ministry of\nScience and Research (BMWF).\n\nNOTES\n\n1 The correlations between the age gap, pretest, posttest, and first language were not\nsignificant and above .17, matching the results from multiple linear regression analyses:\nstandardized betas for the variable age gap were below .1 and not significant.\n2 For an example task, see also the Electronic Supplementary Material.\n3 Theoretically,\n\nthese analyses could have been replaced by a repeated-measures\nANOVA with test time as within-subject factor and role as between-subject factor.

The rank order of the roles with respect to the test time is not\nretained. Therefore, in this study, we abandoned this kind of data analysis and replaced it\nby the more flexible MLR analysis.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBreit, S.\n\n(2009).

Introduction \n\nPeer-assisted learning has proven to be a cost-effective intervention ( Levin et al., 1984 ), yielding gains in both academic \nand non-academic (social and communication) skills among students ( Cohen et al., 1982; Rohrbeck et al., 2003; Topping, \n2005 ). Classwide peer tutoring is one approach to peer-assisted learning, in which students in a class are paired to work \ntogether. Research indicates that this method can significantly improve students\u2019 performance in reading, spelling, and math \nat low cost ( Fantuzzo et al., 1992; Fuchs et al., 1997; Greenwood et al., 1989 ). While most studies of peer tutoring have been \nconducted in developed countries, its cost-effectiveness is an even more desirable feature in resource-constrained developing \ncountries. 1 \n\nBuilding on a large body of literature on incentives to learn and peer effects, we designed and tested the impact of a \npeer tutoring program. 2 The program paired high-achieving students as tutors with their lower-achieving classmates of the \n\n(cid:2) \n\nWe would like to thank Chu Yang and M.

Baseline and post-intervention surveys on demographics, family background, \nmental health were collected, and standardized tests were conducted. \n\nThe peer tutoring program had both intended and unintended effects. On the positive side, tutors experienced an im- \nprovement of 0.41 standard deviations in standardized math scores. In addition, none of the tutors in the treatment group \ndropped out of school during the semester, compared with three out of the 99 students in the control group (who would \nhave been tutors had they been in the treatment group). The program also led to improvements among tutors in men- \ntal health measures, attitudes toward schooling, and incidences of misbehavior (arguments and fights with classmates and \nabsences). \n\nHowever, contrary to the program\u2019s goal, tutees exhibited no gains in math scores and a decline of 0.27 standard de- \nviations in their self-reported mental health scores after participating in the program. Breaking the mental health scores \ninto subcategories, we found that the worsened mental health scores were mainly due to higher learning stress. The most \ncompelling explanation is that the set-up of the program brought to light the tutees\u2019 standing, by design, in the bottom half \nof their class. \n\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to examine how structured peer tutoring affects students\u2019 mental health. The \nincrease in tutees\u2019 learning stress could be due to the publicity of their standing in the bottom half of their class brought to \nlight by the program. In the post-intervention survey, 32.2% of tutees reported that they felt a little or very embarrassed by \nthe program, as opposed to 16.7 percent of tutors. \n\nThe results underscore the importance of how peer tutoring programs are implemented. Although some previous studies \nexamined the social and emotional effects of peer tutoring, these earlier studies mainly focused on the program\u2019s impact on \nattitudes towards school and classmates and social behavior ( Scruggs and Mastropieri, 1998; Sutherland et al., 20 0 0; Tolmie \net al., 2010 ). 5 The positive effects on tutors are consistent with previous findings by Webb and Farivar (1994) that giving \nhelp and providing answers to peers is associated with improved mathematics achievement. Maher et al. (1998) also found \nthat, when disruptive students served as peer tutors, their achievement and behavior improved. \n\nThe  closest  program  design  to  our  study  is  Li  et  al.  (2014) ,  who  conducted  a  randomized  trial  with  primary  school \nstudents in China and offered pairs of high and low achieving students group incentives for learning. There are two main \ndifferences between their intervention and ours. First, we incentivized for pair improvement, while they incentivized for \ntutees\u2019 improvement. Second, in their study, the top quarter of students were matched to sit with and help the bottom \nquarter of students to improve, and therefore the middle 50% students were not involved; in our study, all students were \npart of the peer tutoring program. In contrast to our findings, Li et al. (2014) did not find significant improvement among \nthe helpers, but tutees improved their test scores by approximately 0.265 standard deviations. The positive effects on tutees \nand insignificant effects on tutors in their study may partly reflect the fact that they incentivized tutees\u2019 improvement rather \nthan (as we did) the improvement of both tutor and tutee. \n\nIn the remainder of this paper, Section 2 describes the design of the peer tutoring program and presents some back- \nground information on the schools where the study was conducted. Section 3 evaluates the effects of peer tutoring program \nquantitatively and presents some qualitative feedback from post-intervention surveys. Section 4 discusses some possible \nexplanations for our results and proposes program modifications that could potentially prevent the unintended effects on \ntutees. \n\n2. Program design and implementation \n\nIn rural Northwestern China, more than 14% of middle school students drop out during their Nine Year Compulsory \nEducation ( Yi et al., 2012 ). In light of the educational and social/emotional issues faced by students, many of whom live \naway from their families while attending school, peer tutoring may address the diverse needs of tutees, while also benefiting \ntutors, who could derive pleasure and pride from helping their peers and learn from teaching. \n\n2.1. Program design \n\nThe peer tutoring program matched top students as tutors to lower-performing students and provided incentives for the \n\ntwo to study together, improve their academic performance, and complete their education. \n\n( Angrist et al., 2009; Cornwell et al., 2006; Kremer et al., 2009 ), rewards for performance improvement or number of books read ( Fryer, 2011 ), and con- \nditional cash transfers ( Rawlings and Rubio, 2005 ). Gneezy et al. (2011) provide a review of these studies; incentives for attendance and enrollment are \ngenerally effective, while incentives for achievements bring mixed results. \n\nRohrbeck et al. (2003) found that same-gender peer-assisted learning studies have a greater effect size on average than mixed-gender ones. \nPrevious research has documented benefits from introducing team-based incentives for education, especially for disadvantaged groups ( Blimpo, 2014; \n\nSutherland et al. (20 0 0) reviewed eight experimental studies of the effectiveness of cooperative learning for students with emotional and behavioral \n\n3 \n4 \n\n5 \n\nLi et al., 2014 ). \n\ndisorders, and found mixed results. \n\n\fY. Song et al. / Research in Economics 72 (2018) 33\u201348 \n\n35 \n\nTo create tutor/tutee pairs, students in each class were ranked within gender groups according to their overall academic \nperformance from the previous semester (based on their performance in reading, math, English, politics, history, geology, \nand biology), and divided into two equal-sized groups of those in the top and bottom 50th percentiles. We then matched \nsame-sex pairs of students within their percentile group. For example, the top female student was matched with the female \nstudent who was just below the 50th percentile within the female students. If there were 40 students in a class (20 boys \nand 20 girls), the girl ranked first would tutor the 11th ranked girl, and the 10th ranked girl would tutor the 20th ranked \ngirl. 6 The ranking gap between the tutors and tutees is, by design, the same for every pair. We arranged the pairing in this \nway to maximize the difference and consistency of the difference in academic performance between the tutor and tutee. \n\nThe program incorporated two types of incentives to encourage students to spend time together (input) and to improve \nthe pair\u2019s class rank (output). To encourage the pairs to study together, we provided tasty, healthy snacks (like rice cakes, \ndairy candies, or fiber bars) for class teachers to reward both tutors and tutees when they studied together. Groups were \nrequired to study at least 30 minutes per day to get a daily snack, and at least four times a week to get a weekly bonus \nsnack. In addition, rewards, such as notebooks and pens, were available to pairs based on the improvement in the average \nranking of tutor and the tutee in the school\u2019s monthly exams that cover all subjects. \n\nWe chose to incentivize the students to improve the ranking improvement in the schools\u2019 own comprehensive exams \ninstead of that our own post-intervention standardized math scores. This design was intended to encourage students to \nclosely follow and grasp what they were taught in school, instead of narrowly focusing on math at the expense of other \nsubjects to get the prize. \n\n2.2. Implementation \n\nWe tested the program in two rural middle schools in Yulin, Shaanxi Province, during the fall semester of 2013. Students \nin these schools are from low-income rural families. According to our baseline survey, 59.6% of the fathers and 75% of the \nmothers have six years of education or less, and 91.5% of fathers and 94.5% of mothers have nine years of education or less. \n40% of students come from households that lack running water. \n\nFor the peer tutoring program, we targeted seventh grade students enrolled in No. 5 Middle School and eighth grade \nstudents in Liangzhen Middle School. Eighth grade students at No.5 Middle School and seventh grade students at Liangzhen \nMiddle School comprised the control groups. In total, there were six classes in each group, with 242 students in the treat- \nment group and 216 students in the control group. \n\nThe treatment assignment reflected the sample constraints and other considerations. First, although middle schools in \nChina  include  seventh,  eighth,  and  ninth  grades,  we  did  not  include  the  ninth  grade  in  the  study,  because  the  schools \ndid not want our research team to interfere with the ninth grade students, who were busy preparing for the high school \nentrance exam. Second, we chose to treat one grade in each school, instead of using one school for treatment and the other \nfor control, in part because one school is almost double the size of the other; if we used one as the treatment school, our \ntreatment and control groups would be unbalanced in size. A second consideration is that, even though two schools may \nbe similar to each other, there still might be school-specific factors that would influence the outcomes and thus prevent us \nfrom isolating the effects of treatments. \n\nWe conducted baseline surveys and standardized math tests in late September 2013, before the program was imple- \nmented. We administered a standardized math test to evaluate the impacts on academic performance, since the final exam \ntest scores from different schools are not comparable. The math exams were designed by local educators for different grades \nto evaluate their understanding of the common curriculum. Post-treatment tests were slightly more difficult than the base- \nline tests. Since neither compensation for teachers nor prizes for students were dependent on performance in the math \ntests, no one had the incentive to cheat or make extra effort s to prepare for these tests. \n\nAfter collecting data from the surveys and math tests, the researchers explained the peer tutoring program to teachers \nand students, including the peer matching protocol. After the initial visit, the researchers visited the schools twice during \nthe fall semester to replenish the supply of snack rewards and prizes for improvement. We conducted an evaluation survey \nand standardized math test in late February 2014. The expenses for snacks, prizes for improvement, and compensation for \nextra work put in by the teacher to check the notes and give snack prizes equaled approximately $2,100, $150, and $100 \nUSD, respectively, totaling to approximately $2,350 USD. \n\n2.3. Balance check: pre-treatment characteristics \n\nThe baseline information we collected included three main parts: 1. A student survey with questions on family back- \ngrounds, attitudes towards school, self-efficacy and emotion management, predictions about who was most likely to drop \nout in class, etc. A mental health survey was included in the baseline survey. We computed the mental health score based \non answers to ninety questions on learning stress, fear, impulsiveness, etc.; 2. A standardized math test with twenty-five \n\n6 \n\nIn the cases of odd numbers of female (male) students, the top-ranked student forms a three-people group with the middle- and the bottom-ranked \nstudent. For example, if there were 21 girls in one class, the 1st ranked girl would tutor both the 11th and 21st ranked girls. We checked whether group \nsize matters for treatment effects and did not find statistically significant results. \n\n\f36 \n\nY.

Similarly for tutors. The \u201cControl\u201d and \u201cTreatment\u201d columns show the means and \nstandard deviations in parentheses. The \u201cDiff\u201d column shows the difference and robust standard errors in paren- \ntheses, with significance level indicated by \u2217 \u2217 \u2217p < 0.01, \u2217 \u2217p < 0.05, and \u2217p < 0.1. Baseline math scores are stan- \ndardized within grade. Mental health score is calculated based on 100 questions, with higher score meaning \nbetter mental health condition. Parental education is categorical as follows: less than elementary (1), elemen- \ntary (2), middle school (3), high school (4), vocational college (5), college graduates or above (6). Absence is \naccording to self-reported frequency per semester. \n\nmultiple-choice questions; and 3. A teacher survey asking about their qualification, effort, values, and predictions about \nwhich students were most likely to drop out. \n\nTable 1 presents some baseline characteristics of tutors and tutees in the treatment and control groups. We use students \nwho were ranked in the upper- and lower-half in the control group as the counter-factual groups for tutors and tutees. \nMore specifically, we assign a placebo tutor or tutee dummy for each student in the control group: those who scored above \nmedian among the students of the same gender in class are assigned as placebo tutors; those who scored below are placebo \ntutees. \n\nMost of the pre-treatment characteristics are balanced between two groups, including mental health score, parental ed- \nucation, family size, poverty program participation, and classroom behavior. However, tutees in the treatment group have \nhigher baseline standardized math scores, which could bias the treatment effects upward or downward. Compared with \nlower-achieving  students  in  the  control  group,  it  could  be  more  difficult  for  the  treatment  group  tutees  to  make  more \nprogress, because it may be easier to improve from 40 to 60 than to improve from 60 to 80. On the other hand, for tutees \nwith a better foundation of knowledge, their tutors may have an easier time to help them catch up. Therefore, the direction \nof bias, if any, is unclear. \n\nThe other major unbalanced variable is class size, which is on average 4 students larger (40.5 versus 36.5) for treatment \ngroup students. Since previous studies have shown that a smaller class size generally improves learning outcomes ( Krueger, \n1999 ), a larger class size in the treatment group would probably bias against a positive treatment effect. \n\nOther than the aforementioned baseline comparisons, we performed extra balance checks and present the results in \nTable A1 . On a scale from 1 to 10 in agreement with the statement \u201cI like going to school\u201d, tutees reported a 0.7 lower \nscore relative to their counterparts in the control group, which may also create a bias against the positive treatment effect \non tutees\u2019 academic and mental health improvement. Tutees reported fewer arguments with classmates, and tutors reported \nless fighting with classmates, compared to the control group. There were no statistically significant differences between \nthe treatment and control groups for the following teacher characteristics: years of teaching experience, public qualification, \nyears of obtaining the qualification, years being the class teacher, or any other measured attribute (see Appendix for details). \nWe conducted an omnibus test for all covariates ( Hansen and Bowers, 2008 ) and rejected that the classes in the treat- \nment group and those in the control group are the same. As we discussed above, some unbalanced factors (such as class \nsize and study attitude) could bias the treatment effects downward, while some other factors (such as math score and mis- \nbehavior) could lead to a higher or lower effect. Since we do not have perfectly balanced baseline characteristics between \ntreatment and control groups, especially for tutees, we include all controls for baseline characteristics in our regressions. \n\n\fY.

Notes: Each figure plots residuals from regressing changes in standardized math scores on \nbaseline characteristics. The top figure only uses the tutor/placebo tutor sample, and the bottom one only uses tutee/placebo tutee sample. Math scores are \nstandardized at the grade level with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for pre- and post-intervention separately. Placebo tutor and tutee status in \nthe control group are assigned based on whether they are ranked in the top or lower half of class in terms of academic performance in the baseline. The \np-values of Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov equality tests for tutor and tutee graphs are 0.002 and 0.711, respectively. \n\n3. Evaluating the peer tutoring program \n\nWe estimate the treatment effects on a variety of outcomes, including standardized math scores, mental health scores, \nand other non-academic outcomes such as attitudes and misbehavior. We also summarize the findings from subjective eval- \nuations and suggestions in post-intervention surveys. \n\nFirst, to obtain a graphical understanding of our key outcome variables, we plot the kernel density graphs of changes in \nstandardized math scores and mental health scores for tutors and tutees. Since the baseline math scores were not balanced \nbetween the control and treatment group, we regress changes in math and mental health scores on the baseline characteristics \nof students and plot the residuals by treatment and control group. Fig. 1 shows that tutors in the treatment group signif- \nicantly improved their standardized math scores, compared with the placebo tutors in the control group. The Kolmogorov- \nSmirnov test rejects the equality of changes in standardized math scores between treated tutors and control group tutors, \nwith a p-value of 0.002. As for tutees, however, the two distributions are not statistically significantly different from one \nanother (p-value 0.711). 7 \n\nSince mental health scores are balanced in the baseline, we plotted raw data of first differences in mental health scores \n(post-pre) in Fig. 2 . 8 For tutors, the distribution of control group concentrates at around zero, suggesting that the placebo \ntutors demonstrated little change in mental health score. Tutors, on the other hand, exhibit more changes, but on average \nstill center around zero. Some tutors experienced improvement in their self-reported mental health scores, while others \nshow some decline. Changes in mental health scores for tutees have larger range and more variation. Distribution for placebo \n\n7 \n8 \n\nRaw data without first differences is plotted by tutor/tutee and treat/control in Fig. A1 . \nWe also made similar residual plots for mental health scores as for standardized math scores in Fig. A3 , which look similar to Fig. 2 . \n\n\f38 \n\nY.

Notes: Each figure plots changes in mental health scores of the treatment group and that of the \ncontrol group. Placebo tutor and tutee status in the control group are assigned based on whether they are ranked in the top or lower half of class in terms \nof academic performance in the baseline. Mental health scores have an average of around 62 and a standard deviation of around 14.6, with higher scores \nindicating better mental health. \n\ntutees centers to the right of zero, indicating a positive change in their mental health score. Meanwhile, the distribution for \ntutees centers around zero with a long negative tail, and is to the left of the distribution for placebo tutees. 9 \n\n3.1. Main results \n\nThe main regression equation we use in this paper is: \nic + \u03bcic \n\nY ic = \u03b20 + \u03b21 T c + \u03b22 X \n\n(1) \n\nic is a set of outcome variables, including post-intervention standardized math scores and mental health scores. T c \nwhere Y \nis a dummy variable for program treatment status, which equals one if class c is treated. \u03b2\n1 is the coefficient of interest. \nic represents a set of 27 pre-program characteristics, including standardized math score, demographics, family background, \nX \nbaseline study attitude, misbehavior, mental health survey scores, etc. \u03bc\nic  is independent across different clusters c but \ncorrelated within clusters (classes). 10 \nTable 2 presents estimates for \u03b2\n\n1 , treatment effects for standardized math scores and mental health survey scores. Each \ncolumn represents a separate regression. The first two columns look at standardized math scores as the outcome variable \nand find different effects for tutors and tutees. While tutors experienced a 0.411 standard deviations improvement in math \nscores, the treatment effect for tutees\u2019 math scores is statistically insignificant. \n\nAs for mental health scores, tutees reported a significantly worse mental health survey score (0.27 standard deviations), \nwhile tutors stayed the same. This overall self-reported mental health score can be decomposed into subcategories to enable \nus to better understand the sources of deteriorated mental health scores of tutees. \n\nPanel A in Table 3 presents the treatment effects on subcategories of the mental health survey score on tutees and tutors. \nWe see that the worsened total mental health survey scores of tutees are mainly driven by higher learning stress.

In Panel A, a positive coefficient means a worse problem in that category. For \nexample, learning stress is higher in the treatment group than in the control group for tutees. In Panels B and C, \u201cclass participation\u201d asks for daily \nfrequency; \u201cask question\u201d, \u201cread\u201d, \u201cextra exercise\u201d, and \u201cbullied\u201d are categorical variables from never (0), to sometimes (1), to often (2); other than \n\u201cbullied\u201d, all other variables in Panel C indicate frequency per semester. \n\nstudy time and the stress from wanting to improve performance and ranking in return for their tutors\u2019 help may have led \nto the higher learning stress of tutees. \n\nTutors experienced less social stress and were less anti-social after the peer tutoring program. The interactions within \npairs may have helped tutors to relieve some social pressure and improve their social skills. However, tutors showed higher \nlevels of guilt, which may have resulted from their inability to help resolve the tutees\u2019 problems. The positive and negative \neffects of these three subcategories cancel out, which gives us an insignificant change in overall mental health scores for \ntutors. \n\nThe comprehensive survey also allows us to look at a larger set of non-academic outcome variables, including study \nattitude, effort, and misbehavior. Results are reported in Panel B and C in Table 3 . Most of these estimates are insignificant \nfor tutees, other than completing significantly more exercise problems. For tutors, the peer tutoring program increased their \nliking for school (\u201cOn a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you like going to school?\u201d), decreased the frequency of being bullied \nor getting into arguments or fights, and lowered absence rates. This may reflect that tutors became more respected within \nthe classes because of their role in the peer tutoring program. \n\n\f40 \n\nY.

Quantile Treatment Effects on Standardized Math Scores Notes: Math scores are standardized at the grade level with a mean of 0 and a standard \ndeviation of 1. Tutor and tutee status in the control group are assigned based on whether they are ranked in the top or lower half of class in terms of \nacademic performance in the baseline. The solid line shows the quantile treatment effects estimates, and the dashed lines are the 95% confidence intervals. \n\nLastly, to understand what might be driving the observed effects of the program, we looked separately at students in \nthe treatment group and tested if the following factors were correlated with more positive treatment effect on math score: \ndifferent levels of engagement and satisfaction in the program (choosing the same partner again, feeling hopeful, feeling \nanxious, deeming the program helpful, etc.), peer baseline academic performance, difference between self and peer baseline \nacademic performance, whether the class teacher teaches math, teacher\u2019s years of experience, etc. However, after control- \nling for baseline score and a few characteristics, none of these factors were statistically significantly correlated with post \nstandardized math scores. Note, however, that the insignificant results could also be due to the small sample size. \n\n3.2. Heterogeneous treatment effects \n\nTo obtain an understanding of how distributions of math and mental health scores changed, we ran quantile regressions \n\nto quantify the treatment effects at different percentiles of student academic performance and mental health scores. \n\nY ic = \u03b1 p \n\n0 + \u03b1 p \n\n1 T c + \u03b1 p \n\n2 X ic + \u03b7 p \nic \n\n(2) \n\nwhere  Y \ntreatment dummy, X \nscores below the pth percentile. \n\nic  is  a  set  of  outcome  variables  including  standardized  math  scores  and  mental  health  survey  scores,  T c  is  the \nic is a list of baseline control variables, and 0 < p < 1 indicates the proportion of the population having \n\nFig. 3 presents the results on the quantile treatment effects on math scores, separately for tutees and tutors. Each quan- \ntile regression estimate is plotted as a dot on the solid line in the middle, which shows the treatment effect on that specific \nquantile of the distribution. Dashed lines show the 95% confidence intervals. The peer tutoring program improved standard- \nized math scores for almost all tutors. Although we see no statistically significant benefits on tutees\u2019 math performance, \ntutees at the lowest percentiles had slightly higher point estimates of their math scores. \n\nTutors generally gained more from the program when they had better academic performance, although the top 10% of \nstudents may not have benefited as much. More specifically, the gains in post standardized math score are statistically \n\n\fY. Song et al. / Research in Economics 72 (2018) 33\u201348 \n\n41 \n\nFig. 4.  Quantile Treatment Effects on Mental Health Scores Notes: Mental health scores have an average of around 62 and a standard deviation of around \n14.6. Tutor and tutee status in the control group are assigned based on whether they are ranked in the top or lower half of class in terms of academic \nperformance in the baseline. The solid line shows the quantile treatment effects estimates, and the dashed lines are the 95% confidence intervals. \n\ninsignificant below 30 percentile, then they increased for tutors from 0.3 standard deviations at the 30th percentile to 0.8 \nstandard deviations at the 80th percentile, but they decreased to 0.5 standard deviations for those at the 90th percentile \namong tutors. \n\nA plausible explanation for the heterogeneous effects on tutors\u2019 gains in math scores is that tutors experienced different \nlevels of complementarity between the time spent on peer tutoring and time spent on self-improvement. Tutors at lower \nquantiles may have struggled to understand the materials clearly themselves, while tutors at higher quantiles were able \nto help tutees better and benefited more from clarifying questions. For the top 10% of the tutors, they may have already \ngrasped the easier part of the materials thoroughly, and they benefited less from clarifying those to tutees. \n\nThe quantile treatment effects on mental health scores are shown in Fig. 4 , where we see no significant effect on tutors \nbut negative effects on tutees, mainly for the students at around the 75th percentile of the mental health score distribution. \nThis suggests that worsened mental health scores for tutees mainly came from those with better mental health conditions. \nThe magnitude of worsened mental health score is around 0.28 standard deviations. \n\n3.3. Treatment effects by gender \n\nUnderstanding how the program impacts different subgroups is important for assessing whether it is likely to be more \nic of the treatment \n\nsuccessful with female or male students. We add to the baseline regression Eq. (1) interaction term T c \ndummy variable with gender. \n\n\u2217X \n\nY ic = \u03b20 + \u03b21 T c + \u03b22 X ic + \u03b22 T c \u2217 X ic + (cid:5)ic \n\n(3) \n\nPrevious research has found distinct responses by female and male students to educational interventions ( Angrist et al., 2009 \nfor example). As reported in Table A3 , we do not find any significant gender difference in treatment effect on math or mental \nhealth. However, the positive signs on the interaction terms on treatment and female for standardized math scores, for both \ntutors and tutees, is consistent with previous literature. The insignificance of results may be due to the small sample size. \n\n\f42 \n\nY.

Follow-up measures \n\nIn addition to the demographic, behavioral, and mental health questions in the baseline survey, we also included peer \nprogram evaluation questions in the post survey. More than 90% of students found the program to be at least a little helpful \n(see Table 4 ). Around 70% of students reported that they would choose the same partner if they were to complete the \nprogram again. \n\nWhen we separately look at tutors and tutees, an interesting pattern emerges. Despite the largely positive results for \ntutors and insignificant/negative results for tutees in the quantitative evaluation, more tutees than tutors reported that the \nprogram is \u201cvery helpful\u201d (55% versus 28%) and that they would choose the current partner again (84% versus 54%). \n\nWe also asked five questions about participants\u2019 feelings towards the peer tutoring program, including pride, anxiety, \nembarrassment, hope, and frustration. Mostly the answers were positive. Few students reported that they felt \u201cvery\u201d anx- \nious, embarrassed, and frustrated, and most of those who did were lower-performing students. Thirty-two percent of tutees \nreported that they felt a little or very embarrassed by the program, as opposed to sixteen percent of tutors. \n\nIn the evaluation survey, students also reported on tutoring timing, frequency, length, and the main subject discussed. \nMost students (over ninety percent) reported having participated in peer tutoring more than four times a week, the mini- \nmum requirement to get the weekly bonus snack. Most peer tutoring activities happened between classes or during morning \nand night self-study sessions, and usually lasted for twenty to thirty minutes per day. We tested whether the frequency and \nduration of tutoring can help explain the effects on academic performance or mental health score of the tutor/tutee, but did \nnot find any statistically significant evidence. \n\n4. Conclusions \n\nIn what may be the first evaluation of peer-assisted learning in a developing country setting, we designed and tested a \npeer tutoring program that paired high-performing and low-performing students and incentivized them to study together \nand improve as a group. The most striking finding is that, contrary to our expectations and intentions, tutees did not expe- \nrience improvement in academic performance, but instead, suffered from lower self-reported mental health scores. On the \npositive side, tutors benefited on multiple dimensions, including higher standardized math score, lower social stress, lower \ndropout rate, more favorable attitudes towards school, less absence, and less misbehavior. \n\nAlthough our intervention incorporated incentives for both study effort and academic improvement, the program, as im- \nplemented, turned out to place far more emphasis on snack prizes for peer tutoring time than on prizes for group improve- \n\n\fY. Song et al. / Research in Economics 72 (2018) 33\u201348 \n\n43 \n\nment. This was conveyed to us during the interviews with teachers and in student comments on post-treatment surveys. \nOther than the theory proposed by Fryer (2011) , that students may not know the education production function to respond \nto outcome incentive effectively, it is also possible that students were present-minded and hence more motivated by the \nimmediate and frequent availability of snacks. Students may not have cared enough about the quality of peer tutoring to \nget the rewards for group performance improvement as much as they cared about putting in the minimum amount of \ntutor/tutee interaction to get the snacks. \n\nAnother possible explanation for the lack of improvement in tutees\u2019 performance is that the rewards for improving the \ntutees\u2019 performance may not have been sufficient to motivate students to focus on tutees\u2019 learning progress. This may be an \nimportant reason why our results are different from those of previous studies, which found that using monetary prizes as \ngroup incentives led to improved test scores. As mentioned in the introduction, the comparison with Li et al. (2014) suggests \nthat more emphasis on tutees\u2019 improvement could possibly have positive effects on their academic performance. \n\nSince few of the previous studies examined the impacts of peer tutoring programs on student mental health, our findings \ncall for caution when implementing programs which paired students based on their performance. Publicity of being in the \nlower half of the class could introduce problems of stigma and bring higher learning stress for tutees. How a program is \nframed and delivered to students directly affects their perception of themselves and others, and can affect the program\u2019s \ninfluences on student outcomes. A cross-age peer tutoring program, which pairs students in higher grades with students in \nlower grades, might avoid the stigma effect for tutees while still providing students in the higher grades, with the benefits of \ntutoring. Yet, in such a program, it is unclear if we would still observe the positive effects on tutors, since tutoring materials \nwould be less synced with tutors\u2019 own learning, and therefore may take time away from studying for themselves. \n\nAppendix. More Details on Group Incentives \n\nThe peer tutoring program incentivized students to spend time together (input) and improve the pair\u2019s class rank (out- \nput). To encourage the pairs to study together, we provided tasty, healthy snacks (like rice cake, dairy candies, or fiber bars) \nfor class teachers to reward both tutors and tutees if they studied together. They could study between classes, at morning \n\nFig. A1.  Distributions of Standardized Math Scores Notes: Four plots show kernel density distributions of standardized math scores for four different groups \nof students, divided by their tutor/tutee status and treatment/control assignment. Placebo tutor and tutee status in the control group are assigned based \non whether they are ranked in the top or lower half of class in terms of academic performance in the baseline. In the baseline, tutees had significantly \nhigher math scores than the placebo tutees. After the program, they still outperformed placebo tutees but the gap decreased. \n\n\f44 \n\nY. Song et al. / Research in Economics 72 (2018) 33\u201348 \n\nFig. A2.  Distributions of Mental Health Scores. Notes: Four plots show kernel density distributions of mental health scores for four different groups of \nstudents, divided by their tutor/tutee status and treatment/control assignment. Placebo tutor and tutee status in the control group are assigned based on \nwhether they are ranked in the top or lower half of class in terms of academic performance in the baseline. \n\nand night self-study sessions, or during lunch and dinner breaks. Students were asked to take notes so that the class teacher \ncould verify the interaction between the pair and reward them accordingly with snacks. The pairs who did not take notes \nor randomly copied something onto the notebook would not get a snack from the class teacher. Pairs who studied together \nfour or more times each week received a bonus snack at the end of the week. \n\nIn addition, rewards were available to the student pairs based on the improvement in the average ranking of tutor and \nthe tutee in the school\u2019s monthly exams that cover all subjects. We used a comprehensive exam so that students would not \nbe incentivized to put more effort into only one subject (if performance on one were incentivized) at the expense of others. \nWe chose to use the schools\u2019 own exams to encourage the students to closely follow and grasp what they were taught in \nschool. This design also makes the incentivized peer tutoring program more scalable, because it does not require testing \nbeyond what a school already conducts. \n\nFor midterm and final exams, students were rewarded according to the following procedure. First, we rank the pairs by \nimprovement from their previous ranking, which is the average rank of both the tutor and tutee. Then we divided them into \nthree tiers - a top third, middle third, and bottom third, with the top third consisting of most improved pairs. Each month, \nall students received a surprise prize, but the top third of improvers got a slightly superior prize to that of the middle third, \nand the middle third received a slightly better prize than the bottom third did. Prizes, such as notebooks, pens, or pencils, \nwere diverse enough to differ in desirability. For example, if a tutor improved his ranking by 1 and a tutee improved his \nranking by 3, the pair\u2019s average rank would increase by 2. If a first-tier pair\u2019s ranking improved by 2 to 5 ranks, this pair \nwould get the best type of prize. \n\nThe outcome-based incentive scheme was designed to incorporate several features. First, the fact that everyone gets a \nprize, regardless of his or her performance, should maintain student participation and help foster a positive attitude toward \nthe program. Second, since the reward is based on the improvement in ranking, all students, whatever their rank, have the \nopportunity to earn rewards. Third, it is unlikely that the same pair would improve or decline in average ranking each time, \nso different pairs are likely to get top prizes each month. However, if either member of the pair drops out, no reward will \nbe given. This provides students with the incentive to provide social support to prevent their partner from dropping out of \nschool. \n\n\fY.

The sample comprised ten\n16\u201317-year-old biology tutors, working with twenty-one 14\u201315-year-old students\nfrom a science class over eight weeks. Data were collected through an online wiki,\ntutor interviews, paired tutor discussions and video recordings. Tutors\u2019 perceptions\nof their role motivated them to learn the material, and their learning was supported\nby  discussion  and  explanation,  revisiting  fundamentals,  making  links  between\nconceptual areas, testing and clarifying their understanding, and reorganising and\nbuilding ideas, rehearsing them, and working through them repeatedly, to secure\ntheir  understanding.  When  tutors  employed  long  answer  questions,  there  was\nevidence of reflection on their learning and links made between conceptual areas.\nWhen preparing to tutor, tutors could focus on key points and engage with basic\nideas  from  alternative  perspectives.  Mental  rehearsal  of  peer-tutoring  episodes\nhelped them appreciate weaknesses in their own subject knowledge.\n\nKeywords: peer-tutoring; tutor; peer learning; peer assessment\n\nIntroduction\nPeer-tutoring is \u201cthe recruitment of one student to provide one-on-one instruction for\nanother  student,  accompanied  by  explicit  assignment  of  participants  to  \u2018tutor\u2019  and\n\u2018tutee\u2019 roles\u201d (Roscoe and Chi 2007, 534). Peer-tutoring can facilitate tutees\u2019 learn-\ning  (e.g.  Allen  and  Feldman  1972;  Annis  1983;  Benware  and  Deci  1984;  Topping\n1996;  Griffin  and  Griffin  1998;  Robinson,  Schofield,  and  Steers-Wentzell  2005;\nGinsburg-Block, Rohrback, and Fantuzzo 2006; Roscoe and Chi 2007). There is also\nlimited  evidence  (Roscoe  and  Chi  2007)  of  benefits  to  tutors\u2019  learning  (Allen  and\nFeldman 1972; Goldschmid and Goldschmid 1976; Griffin and Griffin 1997, 1998;\nRobinson,  Schofield,  and  Steers-Wentzell  2005;  Ginsburg-Block,  Rohrback,  and\nFantuzzo 2006). In this study we examine how peer-tutoring supports tutors\u2019 learning\nfrom two perspectives: role theory and socio-constructivist ideas about learning.\n\nPeer-tutoring and role theory\nTutors and tutees can have expectations about each other\u2019s roles (Falchikov 2001). A\nstudent in a tutor role may conform to tutees\u2019 expectations (Hogg and Vaughan 2005),\nand adopt their own perceived characteristics of the role (Bierman and Furman 1981).\nThe  role  change  involved  may  support  their  learning  (Allen  and  Feldman  1972;\nFalchikov 2001).\n\n*Corresponding author.

Winterbottom\n\nForman and Cazden (1985) highlighted tutee questions as being important in role\nformation; the more a tutor is relied upon for information, the more \u201ctutor-like\u201d they\nbecome.  Allen  and  Feldman  (1972)  and  Goodlad  and  Hirst  (1989)  suggested  that\ntutors undergo a restructuring and reorganising of the material to be taught because of\nenacting the tutor role. Tutees\u2019 expectations of the tutor\u2019s knowledge may motivate\nthe  tutor  to  learn  and  understand  the  material,  enhancing  their  attention  to  detail\n(Topping  1996).  Indeed,  Allen  and  Feldman  (1972,  13)  suggest  that  improved  test\nresults derived from \u201cthe child exerting greater effort and working harder on the mate-\nrial while preparing the lesson\u201d. Tutors may also be able to revisit simple concepts\nand  the  fundamentals  that  underpin  a  particular  concept  (Falchikov  2001),  giving\nthem a face-saving opportunity to legitimately revisit very basic ideas (Goodlad and\nHirst 1989).\n\nThe  tutor  role  may  also  increase  tutors\u2019  self-esteem  because  of  the  position  of\nauthority it provides (Allen and Feldman 1972). Deci (1975) suggests that tutors may\nbecome self-determining, by having a meaningful impact on their environment, facil-\nitating their intrinsic motivation, although the pressure to master the material may in\nfact  derive  from  not  wanting  to  appear  incompetent  to  tutees  (Allen  and  Feldman\n1972).  That  said,  peer-tutoring  may  encourage  positive  attitudes  towards  school\n(Allen and Feldman 1972), helping tutors to understand the complexities of teaching,\nempathise with their teachers (Goodlad and Hirst 1989), appreciate how poor behav-\niour affects teaching and learning and understand the social and intellectual goals of\neducation.\n\nPeer-tutoring and learning\nThomas  (1994)  and  Roscoe  and  Chi  (2007)  identified  tutor\u2013tutee  discourse  as\nimportant  to  both  participants\u2019  learning,  providing  tutees  with  increased  attention,\nfeedback  and  opportunity  to  discuss  and  challenge  their  learning.  \u201cLike-minded\u201d\ndiscussion can allow tutor and tutee to \u201cthink in their own ways\u201d (McCormick and\nPressley  1997)  as  peers  may  have  mutual  interests,  enabling  discussion  and  use  of\nrelevant analogy, an appropriate level of detail and language (Roscoe and Chi 2007),\nand  helping  both  participants  to  assimilate  ideas  more  effectively  (Goodlad  and\nHirst  1989).  Indeed,  when  a  tutor  \u201cscaffolds\u201d  tutees\u2019  learning  through  discourse,\ntheir own learning may also be scaffolded (Topping 1996), particularly if the cogni-\ntive  levels  of  tutor  and  tutee  are  closely  matched.  Webb  (1982)  suggests  that  tutor\n\u201cexplanations\u201d  can  involve  a  \u201cworking  through\u201d  of  ideas,  with  the  tutor\u2019s  thought\nprocess important to their developing understanding. She describes a \u201creorganisation\nand  clarification\u201d  in  the  tutor\u2019s  mind,  which  can  develop  through  elaboration  and\nexplanation.  Tutoring  may  also  allow  the  tutor  to  take  a  new  perspective,  or  to  see\nnew  relationships,  facilitating  improved  understanding  (Bargh  and  Schul  1980).\nKing  (2002)  includes  the  use  of  modelling  and  analogy  as  an  example  of  \u201chigher\ncognition\u201d  that  can  arise  in  peer-tutoring  situations.  Building  on  this,  Roscoe  and\nChi  (2007)  suggested  that  positive  outcomes  for  tutors  derive  from  explanations\ncharacterised  by  \u201creflective  knowledge-building\u201d  (where  tutors  reflect  upon  tutees\u2019\nunderstanding  and  constructively  build  upon  prior  knowledge)  rather  than  \u201cknowl-\nedge telling\u201d (where tutors simply lecture). They found school-age students prone to\nthe  latter  style,  and  that  tutor  training  encouraged  knowledge-building  strategies.\nIndeed, successful contingent instruction (when a tutor provides help when required\nand  then  \u201cfades\u201d  the  help  to  enable  tutee  autonomy  (Wood  and  Wood  1996))\n\n\fEducational Studies\n\n 323\n\nrequires  the  tutor  to  use  their  own  understanding  to  help  scaffold  the  tutee\u2019s\nunderstanding.\n\nGraesser and Person (1994) suggested that \u201cnormal\u201d classroom conditions may act\nto reduce \u201cactive enquiry\u201d, and that students learn more in tutoring situations because\nthey can ask questions pertaining to their own developing understanding; answering\ntutees\u2019 questions may itself scaffold tutors\u2019 learning. King (2002) indicates how tutor\nquestioning in peer dyads can help support tutors\u2019 learning, with the roles of tutor and\ntutee quickly dissolving, and leading to an open discussion of equal benefit to both\nparticipants.  However,  such  discussion  must  be  well  structured,  involving  teacher\nintervention  in  some  cases,  and  must  include  thought-provoking  questions  which\nforce students to think about the material, and integrate it with their prior knowlede,\nand construct new knowledge. Indeed, \u201cdeeper\u201d questions designed to stimulate criti-\ncal thinking may be effective in generating \u201cknowledge-building explanations\u201d in the\nsubsequent discourse (Roscoe and Chi 2007).\n\nAs  indicated  above,  initial  training  of  tutors  is  important  (Thomas  1994;  King\n2002; Roscoe and Chi 2007). Wood and Wood (1996) suggest that untrained tutors\nfind contingent instruction difficult and give too much help. Rogoff (1990) notes that\ntutors  often  give  shorter  answers,  and  tend  to  concentrate  on  the  \u201cconcrete\u201d,  rather\nthan explaining, or elaborating on conceptual connections. However, a well-coached\ntutor  tends  to  give  more  \u201cexplanatory\u201d  responses  in  the  same  way  that  a  \u201cgood\u201d\nteacher can direct thought processes through the use of questioning and/or conversa-\ntion. Indeed, Stenhoff and Lignugaris-Kraft (2007) found the most significant factor\nin positive tutee outcomes to be the time spent on initial tutor training.\n\nAnnis (1983) found that preparing to tutor also supported tutors\u2019 learning, over and\nabove the effect of tutoring itself. Benware and Deci (1984) suggested that preparation\nto teach involves more \u201cactive learning\u201d, rather than the \u201cpassive learning\u201d that occurs\nin  response  to  extrinsic  motivation  such  as  testing.  They  compared  a  group  who\nprepared to tutor a student, against a group who learnt the same information, but solely\nto pass a test. The former group scored higher on questions testing conceptual under-\nstanding but worse on questions testing rote learning; indeed, students expecting to\ntutor felt compelled to understand the text conceptually, rather than just rote-learn its\ncontent, and suggested that, in preparing to explain ideas to others, their understanding\nwas \u201creorganised\u201d a finding corroborated by Topping (1998).\n\nResearch questions\nTo examine how peer-tutoring can support the learning of the tutor, this study exam-\nines  three  questions:  (1)  How  did  tutors\u2019  role  develop  during  the  peer-tutoring\nprogramme?; (2) How did peer-tutoring support tutors\u2019 learning during peer-tutoring\nepisodes?; and (3) How did peer-tutoring support tutors\u2019 learning when preparing to\npeer-tutor?\n\nMethods\nSixteen students from a class of 16\u201317-year-old biology A-Level students at a North\nLondon Technology College volunteered to participate, with 10 students (seven girls\nand  three  boys)  randomly  chosen  from  this  group.  From  a  \u201cmixed-ability\u201d  14\u201315-\nyear-old class of 31 students, 11 girls and 10 boys were given parental permission to\nbe involved as tutees.\n\n\f324\n\n J. Galbraith and M. Winterbottom\n\nPeer-tutoring\nWeekly tutoring sessions of 15\u201330 minutes were held after school. We provided some\ngeneric \u201cdiscussion points\u201d in case tutors were uncertain how to progress, but when\nplanning  their  tutoring,  tutors  were  encouraged  to  draw  upon  their  training,  which\nitself  drew  on  guidance  from  Falchikov  (2001)  and  Goodlad  and  Hirst  (1989).  To\npromote  autonomy  and  commitment  (as  suggested  by  Roscoe  and  Chi  [2007]),  we\ngave tutors flexibility to prepare their own resources while providing structured guid-\nance  to  help  facilitate  successful  tutor\u2013tutee  dialogue.  To  help  tutors  recognise  the\nstrengths  and  limitations  of  different  types  of  question  (Webb  1982;  King  2002;\nStenhoff  and  Lignugaris-Kraft  2007),  we  encouraged  them  to  construct  questions\nwhich responded to the recommendations of Graesser and Person (1994): (1) tutors\nshould listen to tutee responses carefully and base questions on them rather than what\nthey perceive as tutees\u2019 knowledge deficits; (2) tutors should avoid asking closed ques-\ntions to test understanding (e.g. \u201cdo you understand?\u201d) but focus on specific confir-\nmation  of  content  covered;  and  (3)  tutors  should  ask  specific  focused  questions.\nGraesser and Person (1994) suggested that tutors should be given examples of ques-\ntions which engage tutees in long, developed answers that help to clarify their under-\nstanding. Examples of such questions were discussed and tutors advised to pre-prepare\nquestions for each tutoring session. The generic question starters used in the reciprocal\npeer-tutoring scheme of King (2002) were adapted and given to tutors to assist them: \n\n\u25cf How would you use ... to ...?\n\u25cf What would happen if ...?\n\u25cf What are the strengths and weaknesses of ...?\n\u25cf How does ... tie in with what you have learnt before?\n\u25cf Explain why ...?\n\u25cf Explain how ...?\n\u25cf What do you think causes ...?\n\nWood and Wood (1996) claim that untrained tutors find contingent instruction very\ndifficult.  Earlier  work  confirms  this  (Webb  1982;  Rogoff  1990),  categorising  tutor\nexplanations as involving either short, one-word answers, giving only \u201cterminal\u201d help;\nor longer, more thought-provoking \u201cexplanatory\u201d responses. Tutors were given guid-\nance  in  how  to  undertake  the  latter,  including  securing  tutees\u2019  attention,  reducing\ndegrees  of  freedom  to  keep  tasks  manageable,  maintaining  direction  towards  goals,\nmarking critical features, controlling frustration and modelling solutions (De Guerrero\nand Villamil 2000).\n\nData collection and analysis\nDuring the study, we used a wiki to \u201cenable the team members to share knowledge\nsimply and quickly\u201d (Sauer et al. 2005, 82). Tutors responded to the following discus-\nsion  points,  and  to  each  other\u2019s  responses,  as  the  study  continued:  (1)  discuss  your\nstart point when preparing to learn the information; (2) discuss how this would differ\nfrom  how  you  would  prepare  for  your  own  test;  (3)  discuss  whether  you  might  be\nworried  about  tutoring;  (4)  describe  what  you  think  the  tutee\u2019s  perception  of  you\nmight be; (5) what do you think makes a \u201cgood\u201d tutor?; and (6) describe any \u201cback-\nground voice\u201d or running through of tutoring situations in your head. Other wiki ques-\ntions  focused  on  particular  research  questions  as  outlined  below.  Semi-structured\n\n\fEducational Studies\n\n 325\n\ninterviews and paired discussions were employed to examine wiki responses in more\ndepth.  Video  recordings  were  made  of  these,  and  of  tutoring  sessions.  Tutors  were\ninterviewed after completing three or more tutoring sessions to assess changes which\ntook place during the programme.\n\nHow did tutors\u2019 role develop during the peer-tutoring programme?\nWe examined tutors\u2019 initial conceptions of their role via responses to the following\nwiki  questions:  (1)  What  was  your  main  motivation  to  learn  the  information  when\npreparing your tutoring session?; (2) What do you think are the behaviours and char-\nacteristics of the \u201cteacher\u201d role?; and (3) How do you think these roles apply when\nacting as a peer-tutor? Drawing on the literature (Allen and Feldman 1972; Benware\nand  Deci  1984;  Goodlad  and  Hirst  1989;  Topping  1996),  interviews  and  wiki\nresponses were coded to identify and examine changes in role which took place as the\npeer-tutoring programme continued.\n\nHow did peer-tutoring support tutors\u2019 learning during peer-tutoring episodes?\nInitial coding of tutoring-episode transcripts identified where terminal help was given\nand where explanatory assistance was provided. Occasions involving explanatory help\nwere analysed further, based on the following distinctions: (1) when the tutor is confi-\ndent  in  the  material  and  can  give  a  more  elaborate  explanation  with  ease;  and  (2)\nwhere the tutor must reorganise their existing (potentially lacking) knowledge in order\nto assist the tutee (Roscoe and Chi 2007). Tutor responses on scaffolding tutees\u2019 learn-\ning  were  also  investigated  via  responses  to  wiki  questions:  (1)  Can  you  outline  the\nthought processes that you went through to make the tutee understand?; and (2) How\ndo you think this process of explaining may have helped you to understand the issue\nbetter  yourself?  These  questions  provided  a  basis  for  semi-structured  interviews.\nFollowing  identification  of  long  answer  questions  in  the  transcripts  of  tutoring\nepisodes,  tutors  were  interviewed  to  discuss  how  they  devised  questions,  and  the\nimpact of such questioning on the tutors\u2019 own learning.\n\nHow did peer-tutoring support tutors\u2019 learning when preparing to peer-tutor?\nTutors\u2019 responses to the following wiki feedback questions were coded: \n\n(1) What was your main motivation to learn the information when preparing your\ntutoring session? (2) How was the way in which you \u201clooked\u201d at the information to be\ntaught different from the way you might have looked at it when preparing for a test?\nThese questions, and outcomes from their analysis, were used to provide discussion\nprompts, as a basis for semi-structured interviews.\n\nAnalysis of findings\nHow did the tutors\u2019 role develop during the peer-tutoring programme?\nStudent tutors conform to their own (Bierman and Furman 1981) and others\u2019 (Hogg\nand  Vaughan  2005)  expectations  of  the  tutor  role.  Open  coding  of  wiki  responses\nrevealed tutors\u2019 initial perceptions of their role. These included setting an example,\nbeing  easy  to  communicate  with,  and  being  an  authority  figure,  a  motivator,  and  a\n\n\f326\n\n J. Galbraith and M. Winterbottom\n\nfriend. A majority of tutors could not \u201cimagine a peer-tutor having the same authority\nas a teacher\u201d (T2), and considered that tutors would not \u201cgive the same value to peers\nas teachers\u201d (T3). Tutors\u2019 main initial motivation for understanding the material was\nbeing competent: (1) in explaining for the benefit of others (35% of responses); (2) to\navoid embarrassment (15%); (3) to gain a sense of achievement or adequacy (12%);\nand (4) to meet their own perceptions of the tutor role (4%), expectations which were\nbroadly similar to those identified by Allen and Feldman (1972), Biddle (1986) and\nGilliam, Callaway, and Wikoff (1994). When interviewed, there was evidence of role\nstrain (Hogg and Vaughan 2005), with tutors initially concerned they would not live\nup to expectations, or be taken seriously by tutees: \n\nThey might not take me seriously ... they might just think well this is just a student so\nwhy should they be teaching me anyway. (T10)\n\nRole strain arising from preconceived role expectations may fuel tutors\u2019 motivation to\nlearn,  enhance  their  attention  to  detail  and  enhance  the  amount  of  time  they  spend\nunderstanding  the  ideas  for  themselves  (Topping  1996).  Indeed,  many  tutors  were\nconcerned about appearing to have sufficient subject knowledge, either generally or\nwith respect to specific content: \n\nBecause if I don\u2019t know the answer then first of all it would be embarrassing. (T5)\n\nBecause I don\u2019t want to be embarrassed or not know the answer or something, I have put\nmore  effort  into  preparing  ...  I  covered  all  the  things  that  I  would  have  asked  about.\n(T10)\n\nI went over the notes in advance, just reading about the topics and making sure my notes\nand stuff were right. (T4)\n\nLike certain parts of the stuff on stars, I would find myself questioning something and\nthen I would check it. So I would know if they asked. (T7)\n\nAfter three tutoring sessions, role strain appeared to reduce as tutors embraced their\nroles, with their expectations and focus shifting from authority and subject knowledge,\nto generating discussion with their tutee on an equal level, a pattern also recognised\nby King (2002): \n\nAfter the first session ... I realised ... she\u2019s really interested in some of the physics so\nI just helped her with that and she had some questions for me, and I made some better\nquestions for the second session. (T1)\n\nReally we just worked on stuff like you do in lessons. I knew more about it I suppose,\nbut it was just like, me helping them and talking ... I think [the first session] was too\nmuch like a lecture, the second time I just used questions. (T7)\n\nLike [tutee] was really easy to talk to, and she asked some questions which made it easier\nfor me too ... it gave me ... a focus for what to talk about, or look at. (T4)\n\nThis change in the tutors\u2019 expectations is striking, and may be indicative of enhanced\nself-esteem  (Allen  and  Feldman  1972;  Goodlad  and  Hirst  1989;  Falchikov  2001).\nDiscourse may also have developed well because: \u201cif both student and tutor have a\nsimilar age, the atmosphere becomes more relaxed, which in turn can open channels\n\n\fEducational Studies\n\n 327\n\nof communication between them\u201d (T1). Indeed, peers are likely to have mutual inter-\nests, which enable discussion and use of relevant analogy, level of detail and language,\nor  avoid  the  cultural  barriers  that  may  exist  between  the  teacher  and  the  student\n(Slavin 1981; Goodlad and Hirst 1989; Roscoe and Chi 2007).\n\nHow did peer-tutoring support tutors\u2019 learning during peer-tutoring episodes?\nTutor explanations can operate at different levels, from confirming facts to longer expla-\nnations involving deeper thought, information processing, and the use of modelling and\nanalogy (Webb 1982; Topping 1996; Roscoe and Chi 2007). Tutors\u2019 explanations were\nexamined  to  determine  whether  they  involved  terminal  help  (acknowledging  and\nconfirming tutees\u2019 responses), \u201cconfident explanatory\u201d help (recollection or consoli-\ndation  of  tutors\u2019  knowledge)  or  \u201clacking  explanatory\u201d  help  (reorganisation  and\nclarification  of  tutors\u2019  understanding)  (Webb  1982).  From  112  explanations,  the\nmajority (58%) involved terminal help, mirroring a pattern found by Rogoff (1990).\nTwenty-four per cent involved confident explanatory help, but without obvious reor-\nganisation of knowledge. Eighteen per cent of explanations were in the lacking explan-\natory  category.  Analysis  of  these  suggested  that  tutoring  near  the  upper  limit  of\nunderstanding is of greater benefit to tutors\u2019 learning. In this example, Tutor 1 attempts\nto explain how atomic structure was determined, and begins by discovering gaps in\nher understanding: \n\nThey fired it at some gold foil, basically they fired an electron or a proton at it, no hang\non, they fired a gold atom at it. No, I\u2019m sure it was a particle. (T1)\n\nSubsequently, the process of explanation appears to test and clarify her understanding,\nhelping her to reorganise (Topping 1992, 1998) and build ideas as she explains (Webb\n1982; King 2002): \n\nThey fired a particle at gold foil, and what happened was, some particles, yeah, they were\nprotons,  went  straight  through  [pause]  yeah,  some  went  straight  through,  and  some\nbounced  off  at  really  large  angles,  and  some  literally  like  rebounded  back  ...  So  that\nbasically  told  them  that  because  that  had  a  positive  ...  [pause]  ...  yeah,  that\u2019s  right,\nbecause  that  had  a  positive  charge  it  totally  repelled  it,  so  that  showed  them  that  the\nnucleus was slightly positive, yeah? (T1)\n\nAfter playing the episode back to the tutor, she admitted that after the explanation she\nunderstood better why the experiment helps understand atomic structure, and she went\non to reinforce her understanding through use of analogy: \n\nYeah, like say the car can get straight through that means that there are no obstructions,\nno nothing, it\u2019s basically empty? (T1)\n\nTutors elaborated on their approach to tutoring. Most initially confirmed the need to\n\u201cbreak it down and make it really simplistic so they can gain the basic picture\u201d (T6),\nrevisiting  the  fundamental  concepts  themselves.  Tutees\u2019  responses  also  made  tutors\nquestion their explanations, and reflect upon how to \u201creorganise\u201d (Topping 1996) the\nideas to help tutees understand: \n\nI was thinking in my head, does that actually make sense ... I was asking myself did she\nget this or not? She looked confused. (T1)\n\n\f328\n\n J. Galbraith and M. Winterbottom\n\nWhat did I say to make them not understand that bit, or get this bit? Or what do I now\nneed to say to make their expression change so they get it. (T7)\n\nLikewise,  tutees\u2019  responses  helped  tutors  to  recognise  when  they  needed  to  correct\ntheir own understanding after tutoring: \n\nI wasn\u2019t really sure about the explanations, but also I was thinking about the stuff I had\nprepared  ...  I  did  [check  the  stuff  I  wasn\u2019t  sure  about  afterwards]  actually,  because\nI thought it might come up again, and also I just wanted to know. (T4)\n\nMany of the tutors talked about repetition as being important to improved explana-\ntions and their own improved understanding, for instance: \n\nI just had to like, go back over it in my mind and keep on repeating everything that I\u2019m\nsaying and making sure that it makes sense. Then by the end I think I got it, I got it just\nby like, going back over it all. (T1)\n\nKing (2002) also found that devising long answer questions may benefit tutors\u2019 learn-\ning, and the level of the tutor\u2019s questions may direct the length, and cognitive level,\nof the subsequent discourse. Literature suggests that student tutors find it hard to ask\nquestions other than those focusing on factual recall or conformation of understanding\n(Graesser  and  Person  1994;  King  2002).  Examination  of  transcripts  confirmed  the\nmajority  of  tutors\u2019  questions  (102  of  138)  were  short  answer,  with  many  seeking\nconfirmation of understanding (\u201cDo you get me?\u201d, \u201cDo you understand?\u201d), or factual\nrecall: \u201cSince some of the information was important I made questions that gave me\nthe answer\u201d (T2). Average tutee response length to a short answer question was 3.8\nwords, and to a long answer question 11.1 words. However, just 36 of 138 questions\nwere long answer. Rogoff (1990) recognised this pattern, with tutors focusing on \u201cthe\nconcrete\u201d, rather than elaborating on conceptual connections. Even long answer ques-\ntions devised by tutors yielded a maximum of two contributions from tutor and tutee.\nBy contrast, discussions deriving from discussion prompts provided by us comprised\nan average of 3.2 contributions from both participants. Although this may suggest that\ntutor training was not extensive enough (Stenhoff and Lignugaris-Kraft 2007), there\nwere signs that devising questions to scaffold tutees\u2019 learning prompted tutors to think\nabout the ideas themselves (Webb 1982): \n\nThe short answer questions were easy [to devise] but the longer ones were a bit trickier. (T1)\n\nMaking up the short questions was very easy ... making the longer questions was a bit\nharder, as [you] had to think about the answers. (T2)\n\nIndeed, some tutors reflected on their own knowledge-building process to ask ques-\ntions (Roscoe and Chi 2007): \u201cI wanted the student to think of the answer in the same\nway as I thought when [devising] the question\u201d (T3). They also made links between\ntopics,  to  help  tutees  make  the  links  themselves  (Bargh  and  Schul  1980):  \u201cThey\ninvolved other topics as well as the topic that I was teaching\u201d (T2).\n\nHow did preparing to tutor support tutors\u2019 learning?\nEvidence suggests that preparing to tutor may benefit tutors\u2019 learning, over and above\nthat of \u201cnormal\u201d learning in lessons (Annis 1983; Benware and Deci 1984; Goodlad\n\n\fEducational Studies\n\n 329\n\nand Hirst 1989; Topping 1998), and over and above tutoring itself. We asked tutors\nhow they approached information when preparing to teach, as opposed to preparing\nfor a test. Responses identified the opportunity to (1) focus on fundamentals, and to\nunderstand the material, rather than (2) simply rote-learning it: \n\nI tried to simplify the topic, so that I could build on it; as if I was teaching someone who\ndidn\u2019t know anything. (T10)\n\n[Normal revision] would be more largely based on memorizing facts and regurgitating\nthem. (T6)\n\nHence, preparation to teach may enable active learning (Benware and Deci 1984) and\nstrategies based upon knowledge-building and transformation rather than just recall\n(Topping 1998; Roscoe and Chi 2007), something confirmed by examination of wiki\ntranscripts. The following strategies were associated with \u201cnormal\u201d revision, includ-\ning memorisation of content, identification of key words, simplification and comple-\ntion  of  past  papers.  By  contrast,  tutors  reported  that  preparing  to  tutor  involved\ndiagrams, simplification of concepts, fun, interest, visualisation of ideas, identification\nof the main points, progression of ideas, building ideas from fundamentals and avoid-\nance of confusing terms.\n\nThese descriptors were used to help support and structure interviews and paired\ndiscussions. Tutors recognised the need to seek out books to help focus on key points\nand essential information: \n\nI looked in the GCSE revision book, like for stuff they need to know, and then I started\nto think about how I could change it and put it in a way that would be easy to remember. (T6)\n\nI looked in my AS revision guide and notes, I have a CGP revision guide and just went\nthrough trying to take out the key points. (T9)\n\nUsing  books  at  the  tutees\u2019  level  helped  tutors  reorganise  the  lesson  material  into  a\nformat  more  easily  understood.  This  helped  tutors  to  revisit  more  fundamental\nconcepts; for example: \n\nIt reminded me of the stuff that we did in the beginning ... things I had forgotten. You\nknow. The simple stuff. (T6)\n\nI just looked at the simpler information and it helped me to understand some of the other\nstuff, like the stuff later on. (T5)\n\nEngaging  with  the  ideas  from  the  tutee\u2019s  perspective  also  appeared  to  inform  the\ndesign and preparation of resources to be used during tutoring: \n\nI think it helps to see the information in the way that they need to know it; it helped to\nmake the questions. (T10)\n\nIn this case the tutor is referring to questions to discuss with tutees, and the need to\ninterpret  information  in  a  different  way  to  devise  questions,  a  process  which  could\nlead to a \u201creorganisation\u201d of their own understanding (Webb 1982; Topping 1998).\nEven \u201c[writing] down explanations, like lesson objectives and stuff, going from one\npoint to the next and so on\u201d (T7) suggests that the tutor engaged with the ideas more\n\n\f330\n\n J. Galbraith and M. Winterbottom\n\nextensively  than  simply  re-reading  their  notes.  Evidence  from  other  tutors  corrobo-\nrated this idea: \n\nI just tried to manipulate it into a simpler form, so that it would be easier to know. (T6)\n\nThere was some stuff in there that I had forgotten, it explained it really well and I could\nuse it to make summarising notes. (T10)\n\nI made the simple cycle, and then put in the details, you know all the new stuff which\nwe don\u2019t know and it builds up on that. (T4)\n\nHence, preparing to tutor appeared able to facilitate \u201ctransformation and reorganisation\u201d\nof  existing  knowledge  with  the  development  of  \u201cnew  associations  and  integration\u201d\n(Topping 1998), and triggering the kind of conceptual learning described by Benware\nand Deci (1984). Likewise, it may explain some of the outcomes of prior studies indi-\ncating a benefit to tutors\u2019 learning (Annis 1983; Benware and Deci 1984; Topping 1998).\nMental rehearsal or modelling of the tutoring session also appeared important to\ntutors\u2019  learning.  In  those  cases  where  tutors  modelled  an  \u201cimagined  discourse\u201d,  the\ntypes  of  such  discourse  appeared  to  support  tutors\u2019  learning.  Some  such  discourse\ninvolved  tutees  asking  questions,  helping  tutors  to  focus  on  developing  their  own\nsubject knowledge: \n\nI imagined them asking, what is this leguminous thing? And I would say, well these are\nthe nodules and so on, and they would say, what are those? Or what do they do? (T5)\n\nLike they would ask me questions about the stuff I was reading and I would check it, you\nknow, like imagining the harder things that they could ask me. (T10)\n\nI checked [the answers] as they came up just to make sure. (T4)\n\nOther  tutors  rehearsed  asking  the  tutees  questions,  looking  at  the  information  in\ncombination  with  the  key  learning  points  for  the  topic,  and  then  devising  suitable\nquestions to test the tutee, all of which suggest greater engagement with the material\nby the tutor: \n\nI  imagined  bits  where  I  could  say,  stick  in  a  question  about  nitrogen  in  fertilizers,  or\nbacteria. You know, like the bits they need to know. (T4)\n\nTutors also imagined how they would explain ideas in the following example, explain-\ning how they would link the lesson content to something relevant to the tutee: \n\nI definitely thought about the ways that I might go about explaining things ... to bring\nin natural stuff, maybe what\u2019s going on in that tree \u2013 so if you link it up with something\nthat\u2019s happening in everyday life they might be more interested. (T4)\n\nSome tutors\u2019 intention was to \u201chelp them get to the answer without just telling them\u201d\n(T10), planning contingent instruction in a way which fosters tutors\u2019 engagement with\nthe ideas at a sophisticated level, and high cognitive demand (Wood and Wood 1996): \n\nI drew out the first four compounds for the alkanes and made them write out the formula\nfor them. From the empirical formula they derived the general formula and did the same\nfor the alkenes. (T7)\n\n\fEducational Studies\n\n 331\n\nConclusions and implications\nStudents\u2019  initial  perceptions  of  a  tutor\u2019s  role  developed  from  a  preoccupation  with\nbeing  expert  and  authoritative;  their  motivation  to  learn  the  material  being  fuelled\nprimarily by avoiding embarrassment, and being able to answer tutees\u2019 questions. As\nthe  peer-tutoring  programme  progressed,  they  became  more  facilitative  of  tutees\u2019\nlearning through discourse, potentially drawing on enhanced self-esteem, and benefit-\ning from the chance to discuss ideas on an equal level with peers. Indeed, there was\nevidence that explaining helped to support tutors\u2019 learning through testing and clari-\nfying their understanding, and reorganising and building ideas. Tutoring gave tutors\nthe opportunity to revisit fundamental ideas and make links between conceptual areas.\nLikewise,  it  prompted  tutors  to  rehearse  ideas,  working  through  them  repeatedly  to\nsecure  an  appropriate  level  of  understanding.  Questioning  also  appeared  to  support\ntutor\u2019s learning. Although most questions were short, and did not elaborate on concep-\ntual  ideas,  when  tutors  did  use  long  answer  questions,  there  was  some  evidence  of\nreflection  on  their  own  learning  and  again  links  made  between  conceptual  areas.\nPreparing  to  tutor  also  gave  tutors  the  opportunity  to  focus  on  key  points,  and  to\npresent material in a format which required engagement with basic ideas and under-\nstanding of the tutee\u2019s perspective, forcing the tutor to actively engage with the lesson\ncontent.  Likewise,  there  was  evidence  of  tutors\u2019  working  through  and  reorganising\ntheir understanding and using mental rehearsal of peer-tutoring episodes to help focus\non gaps in their own subject knowledge.\n\nThis study examined one instance of peer-tutoring. It does not aim to make gener-\nalisations  which  apply  across  settings,  but  it  may  provide  useful  insights  for  other\nteachers  working  in  similar  contexts.  Given  a  tutoring  scheme  takes  time  to  imple-\nment, similar activities could be designed to engage students in the kinds of \u201cactive\u201d\nlearning highlighted above, without the logistical difficulties of actually running the\npeer-tutoring itself. However, students may need help to appreciate the value of such\napproaches  to  their  developing  understanding.  There  were  signs  that  peer-tutoring\nenhanced  tutors\u2019  metacognition,  with  many  reflecting  upon  how  to  enable  tutees\u2019\nlearning. This area may be a fruitful one for further research.\n\nNotes on contributors\nJonathan  Galbraith  is  a  science  teacher  at  Wembly  High  School.

Yet researchers and language program directors alike often ignore\nthe linguistic and cultural differences that peer tutors possess, instead categorizing them homogeneously\nas \u2018experts\u2019 or \u2018native speakers.\u2019 In this article, I use a case study to closely examine how knowledge is\nnegotiated in one peer tutoring cohort. Grounding my analysis in ethnomethodological and linguistic\nanthropological notions of epistemics and expertise, I show how one peer tutor drew from various em-\nbodied, artifactual, and historical resources in order to negotiate lexical gaps and position herself as an\nexpert in the target language. At the same time, I demonstrate how essentialist ideologies help construct\na language expert by highlighting the learners\u2019 alignments to the tutor\u2019s epistemic stance as knower, even\nwhen faced with conflicting information. These findings question the ways knowledge and expertise are\ntraditionally perceived in peer tutoring and other additional language learning contexts, emphasize the\nneed for training peer tutors in cooperative learning methods and articulating their knowledge with\nthat from the classroom setting, and highlight the complex ideologies that surround the \u2018right to know\u2019\na target language.\n\nKeywords: peer tutoring; epistemics; Spanish; interlocutor differences\n\nPEER TUTORING, A METHOD OF COOPERA-\ntive learning, is viewed as having multiple bene-\nfits for additional language learning. Consisting\nof one or more learners and what Huong (2007,\np. 336) termed the \u201cmore knowledgeable peer,\u201d\nan individual who ostensibly possesses more lin-\nguistic and/or cultural expertise, peer tutoring\nis both cooperative in its construction of mean-\ning through dialog and asymmetrical in terms of\nstatus and knowledge possession. As such, inter-\nactions regarding what is known and not known\n\nThe Modern Language Journal, 100, 2, (2016)\nDOI: 10.1111/modl.12334\n0026-7902/16/508\u2013521 $1.50/0\nC(cid:2)2016 The Modern Language Journal\n\nabout the target language are crucial elements\nof peer tutoring discourse, both for tracking the\nlearning process and for establishing and negoti-\nating tutor/learner identities.\n\nYet a review of the research literature indicates a\nlack of differentiation regarding what peer tutors,\nas assumed experts, bring to tutoring interac-\ntions. Grouped under categories such as \u2018native\nspeaker,\u2019 studies of peer tutoring often fall prey to\nthe same essentialist definitions that characterize\ninterlocutors in other studies on second language\nlearning. The inability to articulate the linguistic,\ncultural, and symbolic differences in knowledge\nthat peer tutors possess contributes to an ongo-\ning perception by learners, language program\ndirectors, and researchers alike of languages and\n\n\fMichele Back\n\ncultures as static and decontextualized, rather\nthan as imbued with an array of personal histories\nand perspectives. Moreover, undifferentiated\ntreatment of peer tutor knowledge results in a\nshortage of detailed analyses regarding how this\nknowledge often conflicts with learner percep-\ntions, textual/artifactual resources, and other\nsources of information about the language.\n\nOne way to articulate these differences is\nthrough analyzing particular peer tutoring cases\nand how knowledge is enacted therein. In this\narticle I combine a case study approach with a\nclose discourse analysis and the ethnomethod-\nological notion of epistemics in interaction, or \u201chow\nparticipants display, manage, and orient to their\nown and others\u2019 states of knowledge\u201d (Jakonen\n& Morton, 2015, p. 73). This concept has been\nutilized in other studies of L2 learning, including\nclassroom peer interaction (Jakonen & Morton,\n2015), teacher\u2013student interaction (Sert, 2013),\nand L2 writing (Bell & Elledge, 2008; Efstathiadi,\n2010). As noted in Rusk, Po\u0308rn, & Sahlstro\u0308m\n(2014), \u201c[e]pistemic stance and status, knowing\nand the dynamic relationships between partici-\npants\u2019 knowledge is recognizably a vital part of\ndoing [language] learning and teaching\u201d (p. 3).\nWithin this context-based exploration of knowl-\nedge in interaction, I also incorporate linguistic\nanthropological notions of expertise, which high-\nlight the ideologies and socialization processes\nthat surround the display and negotiation of\nknowledge.\n\nThe study analyzes how one peer tutor\u2013learner\ncohort co-constructed knowledge and expertise\nin peer tutoring sessions for Spanish as an addi-\ntional language. Specifically, it addresses the fol-\nlowing research questions:\n\nRQ1. What resources does the peer tutor use to\nmediate knowledge and expertise in the\ntarget language?\n\nRQ2. What role does epistemic stance play in\nthe co-construction of expert and novice\nidentities in this peer tutoring setting?\n\nRQ3. What role do the learners play in position-\ning the peer tutor as knowledgeable?\n\nAfter a review of previous studies on peer\ntutoring, I discuss how notions of epistemics and\nexpertise can be used as frameworks for analyzing\nthe co-construction and mediation of knowledge\nin peer tutoring sessions. I then present the case\nof one peer tutor, Lorena, and her peer learners,\nAlice and Rhonda. After providing contextual de-\ntails about the setting and participants, I focus on\nthree conversational episodes from this cohort\n\n509\n\nwhere knowledge was negotiated successfully\nand unsuccessfully, employing the categories\nof resolved and unresolved lexical epistemic\nsearch sequences (ESSs) as well as conversational\nand embodied expressions of alignment and\nknowledge negotiation.\n\nThrough this analysis I show how Lorena used\nsymbolic, embodied, and artifactual tools to medi-\nate gaps in her own knowledge of Spanish, while\ncontinuing to construct her own epistemic stance\nas expert. Lorena\u2019s learners played a key role\nin aligning to Lorena\u2019s epistemic stance through\nmitigations and silences, despite conflicting infor-\nmation from textual or artifactual sources, some\nof which were the same tools that Lorena used to\nmediate her lexical gaps in Spanish. These find-\nings interrogate the ways that more knowledge-\nable interlocutors are traditionally perceived in\nsecond language learning environments and em-\nphasize the need to further explore the complex\nideologies surrounding the \u2018right to know\u2019 a tar-\nget language, as well as to train tutors in meth-\nods that allow them to jointly negotiate meaning\nwith their learners. The study also begins to move\nthe discussion on peer tutoring from its dominant\nfocus on English language teaching toward an-\nother language, here Spanish, with its own rich\ncultural and linguistic variety that feeds into inter-\nlocutor differences. Finally, by incorporating em-\nbodied expressions of expertise, the study adds to\nexpanding research evidence that explores alter-\nnative interactional resources for claiming knowl-\nedge and treats language as an embodied activity.\n\nPEER TUTORING AND LANGUAGE\nLEARNING\n\nCollaborative, peer interactive language learn-\nfor language\ning is perceived as beneficial\nlearners\nfrom both interactionist (Keck, et\nal., 2006; Mackey & Goo, 2007) and socio-\ncultural (Swain, 2006; Swain & Lapkin, 2002)\nperspectives. While interactionists highlight the\nincreased opportunities of peer interaction for\nnegotiation of meaning, sociocultural theorists\nnote the prospects for collaboration, scaffold-\ning, and co-construction of knowledge. Several\nstudies have pointed to the added value of a\nmore knowledgeable interlocutor, such as a peer\ntutor (e.g., Beasley, 1997; Ferna\u0301ndez\u2013Dobao,\n2012; Gisbert & Font, 2008; Hamid, Sussex,\n& Khan, 2009; Huong, 2007; Young & Miller,\n2004). Previous studies on the involvement of\nmore knowledgeable interlocutors in language\nlearning settings have primarily focused on\nlearners of English (e.g., Bell & Elledge, 2008;\n\n\f510\n\nFerna\u0301ndez\u2013Dobao, 2012; Thonus, 2004; Weigle &\nNelson, 2004), although some research on peer\ninterlocutor discourse in Spanish is also available\n(e.g., East, Tolosa, & Villers, 2012; Wright et al.,\n1995).\n\nPeer tutoring, defined in Gisbert & Font (2008)\nas a method of cooperative learning \u201cbased on the\ncreation of pairs of students with an asymmetri-\ncal relationship and a single common goal\u201d (p.\n482), is said to have multiple advantages for lan-\nguage learners and tutors alike. Meadows (2010)\nnoted that activities, such as peer tutoring, that\nallowed learners to interact with more competent\nspeakers of a target language, enabled learners to\n\u201cestablish a legitimate positioning for themselves\u201d\nwithin the target culture (p. 106). Drawing further\nupon the notion of legitimate peripheral partici-\npation, Young and Miller (2004, p. 521) discussed\nhow one English language learner\u2013tutor cohort\nevolved with respect to their participation in \u201crevi-\nsion talk,\u201d with the learner gaining greater owner-\nship of both the interaction and the revision pro-\ncess. East et al., (2012) discovered that students\nof Spanish in New Zealand reacted much more\npositively to the language and the classroom set-\nting when they were able to participate in online\nreciprocal peer tutoring with English language\nlearners in Colombia. Further psychological ben-\nefits of peer tutoring include findings by Gisbert\nand Font (2008), who demonstrated that English\nlanguage learners showed improvements in self-\nconcept and self-esteem with respect to their abil-\nities in English after interactions with peer tutors.\nLogistical benefits to peer tutoring were also dis-\ncovered; Huong (2007) noted how the presence\nof a more knowledgeable peer paved the way for\nbriefer task negotiation, allowing learners to focus\nmore on the content of the lesson.\n\nDespite these benefits, other researchers have\nthe peer tutoring context often\nargued that\nleads to imbalanced exchanges,\nleaving little\nopportunity for learner interaction. For example,\nTrimbur (1987) showed that peer tutors talked\ntwice as much as learners and asked more closed\nquestions, in this way restricting learner involve-\nment. Thonus (2004), in a review of peer tutoring\nstudies, noted that most findings pointed to peer\ntutors using longer turn lengths, an increased\nuse of directives, and a \u2018take charge\u2019 approach\nrelative to the learner. Jones et al. (2006), in a\ncomparison of online versus face-to-face peer\ntutoring, found that an online context was more\negalitarian and addressed more global issues for\nthe very reasons raised by Trimbur (1987) and\nThonus (2004). Finally, Waring (2005) showed\nthat peer tutoring settings could create a \u201cpattern\n\nThe Modern Language Journal 100 (2016)\n\nof resistance\u201d due to differing identity claims and\ncompeting notions of expertise (p. 141).\n\nIt appears, therefore, that although peer tu-\ntoring offers the potential for increasing learner\nparticipation, the problems described previously\ncan inhibit these benefits. One possible reason\nfor issues such as peer tutor dominance is a\nlack of training; even though training has been\ndeemed essential for the incorporation of ap-\npropriate tutoring behaviors (Fuchs et al., 1994;\nThurston et al., 2009), peer tutor training varies\nwidely among institutions and language depart-\nments. For example, although the peer tutor in\nthe current study received written materials to as-\nsist with oral participation exercises, she had re-\nceived no explicit training on how to use these ma-\nterials. A lack of training often leads peer tutors to\nadopt a less interactive approach, utilizing strate-\ngies such as closed questions and longer times at\ntalk (Thurston et al., 2009).\n\nIn further examining the disadvantages of peer\ntutoring raised by prior studies, what stands out\nis an overarching concern with perceived peer tu-\ntor expertise, indicated by what researchers have\ntermed a more \u2018teacherly\u2019 or \u2018take charge\u2019 atti-\ntude. Thonus (2004) outlined how learners ex-\npect tutors to behave as \u201chigher status interlocu-\ntors\u201d (p. 235), while both Henning (2001) and\nThonus (2002) noted the disconnect between the\nperception of a tutor as more \u201cpeer-like\u201d and per-\nceived tutorial success. Peer tutors come from a\nvariety of different sociolinguistic backgrounds,\nyet their position as tutors often leads to an as-\nsumption that they are experts in all of the vari-\neties and registers of the language taught in the\nclassroom. Yet, to date, little has been done to\nunpack the reasons underlying this perception of\npeer tutors as unreserved experts.\n\nOne of these reasons could be the categoriza-\ntion of peer tutors before they even engage in\ninteractions with learners. Supervisors and re-\nsearchers alike frequently group peer tutors into\nessentialized categories such as \u2018native speaker,\u2019\ndespite the problematic nature of this catego-\nrization (e.g., Ferna\u0301ndez\u2013Dobao, 2012; Thonus,\n2004; Thorne, 2003). Creese, Blackledge, and\nTakhi (2014) noted that the \u2018native speaker\u2019 la-\nbel \u201cautomatically endows one with a high level\nof competence in all domains of one\u2019s first lan-\nguage\u201d (p. 938). Yet critiques of the native speaker\nlabel abound in second language acquisition\n(SLA) literature, ranging from its inability to\ntake into account multilingual interaction (Cook,\n1999; Firth & Wagner, 1997; Llurda, 2009), to its\nglossing over of the complex interplay between\nlanguage skills and allegiance to a particular\n\n\fMichele Back\n\nculture (Leung, Harris, & Rampton, 1997). More-\nover, the term \u2018native speaker\u2019 is rarely defined in\nthese studies, and it is up to the reader to deter-\nmine what, precisely, these interlocutors can and\ncannot do with the language.\n\nEven when native speakers are described in\nmore detail in the peer tutoring literature, they\nare still positioned unreservedly as experts in the\nvariety and register of the language being taught,\nwith no attempt to distinguish between the types\nof knowledge they might possess and how that\nmight affect their negotiations with learners (for\nan important exception, see Weigle & Nelson,\n2004). This type of positioning not only fails to\naccount for the differences in knowledge that im-\npact the process of negotiating meaning, but also\nignores the personal histories, symbols, and com-\nplexities that each speaker of a language brings\nto any given interaction. As Thorne and Heller-\nmann (2015) asserted, \u201cheterogeneity of exper-\ntise is a commonplace dimension of the human\nexperience\u201d (p. 282), a fact that is not readily ac-\nknowledged in most research on peer tutoring.\n\nRather than using static categories such as \u2018na-\ntive speaker,\u2019 many scholars have suggested recon-\nceiving this notion as a context-sensitive, interac-\ntional achievement (Doerr, 2009; Egbert, 2004;\nFirth & Wagner, 1997; Kubota, 2009; Piller, 2002)\nthat views language as symbolic and contextual\n(Kramsch, 2009; Song & Kellogg, 2011). This out-\nlook supports the use of a case study approach in\norder to examine in detail the particular episodes\nin which an expert or native speaker identity may\nor may not be constructed, as well as the symbols\nand contexts realized in each interaction. Fur-\nthermore, this approach parallels ethnomethod-\nological and linguistic anthropological notions of\nknowledge and expertise, incorporating impor-\ntant elements such as interaction, ideology, and\nsocialization. An outline of these notions follows\nin the next section.\n\nEPISTEMICS, EXPERTISE, AND PEER\nTUTORING INTERACTION\n\nUnlike the essentialized portrayals of knowl-\nedge in much of the research on peer tutor-\ning, ethnomethodological approaches to epis-\ntemics highlight its highly interactional nature,\nnoting that territories of information claimed\nby interlocutors can overlap and shift depend-\ning on context and area of knowledge (Kamio,\n1997). These territories are often negotiated\nthrough mediation, a dialogically constructed,\nsocio-interactional achievement in which inter-\nactants work together to resolve troubles of un-\n\n511\n\nderstanding (Pekarek Doehler, 2002; Poehner,\n2008). This type of work may also incorporate\nwhat Thorne (2003) and others have termed \u201cme-\ndiational artifacts,\u201d such as written texts or Inter-\nnet search engines (p. 39).\n\nHeritage (2012) highlighted the interactional\nnature of epistemics by differentiating between\nepistemic status (the relative access to these terri-\ntories by interlocutors) and epistemic stance (how\nthis access to knowledge is expressed moment to\nmoment), noting that epistemic status \u201ccan be al-\ntered from moment to moment as a result of spe-\ncific interactional contributions\u201d (p. 4). These ex-\npressions may include linguistic resources such\nas boosters (\u201ccertainly\u201d) and hedges (\u201cmaybe\u201d),\nwhich serve to confirm and downplay, respec-\ntively, a speaker\u2019s epistemic status. As mentioned\npreviously, other resources for mediating knowl-\nedge may be artifactual, such as the incorporation\nof technology or texts; or embodied, including\nhand gestures, gaze direction, or shaking one\u2019s\nhead (Belhiah, 2009; Sert & Walsh, 2013).\n\nThe notion of epistemic status highlights how\nexpressions of stance can index not only the\nknowledge in question, but also the \u201crights to\npossess and articulate it\u201d (Heritage, 2012, p. 5).\nThe hierarchical and ideological aspects of epis-\ntemics are further outlined from a linguistic an-\nthropological perspective in Summerson Carr\u2019s\n(2010) discussion of expertise. Summerson Carr\nsaw expertise as \u201cinherently interactional,\u201d not\nunlike the notion of epistemics (p. 18). Indi-\nviduals in positions of expertise often acquire\nwhat Matoesian (1999) and Summerson Carr\n(2010) termed \u201cmastery of verbal performance,\u201d\nincluding the use of language \u201cto index and\ntherefore instantiate already existing inner states\nof knowledge\u201d (p. 19). This performance in-\ncludes the mastery of certain verbal registers,\nas well as nonverbal signs, through an extensive\nprocess of socialization, evaluation, and institu-\ntionalization. Socialization practices that transmit\nexpertise can include role-playing exercises, sim-\nilar to those found in Motivational Interview-\ning (Summerson Carr, 2010) or among ma-\ngicians\u2019 apprentices (Jones & Shweder, 2003),\nor the observation\u2013internalization\u2013imitation se-\nquence used with Mexicano woodcarvers\u2019 ap-\nprentices (Briggs, 1986), preservice teachers, and\nother apprenticeship relationships.\n\nHowever, as I have mentioned previously, many\npeer tutors have not been trained in tutoring\nmethods; nor, as speakers of a particular language\nvariety, have they necessarily been socialized into\nthe expression of other varieties. Because of\nthis, peer tutors frequently lack the master or\n\n\f512\n\nthese repertoires, as well\nexpert registers of\nas knowledge about how to transmit them to\nstudents. Thus, their own requests for informa-\ntion during a peer tutoring session cannot be\ntreated as teacher-centered \u2018known answer\u2019 or\ndisplay questions. In fact, a tutor\u2019s request for\ninformation may be viewed as evidence of what\nHeritage (2013) termed K\u2212 (knowledge minus)\nrelative to the peer learner, and could be poten-\ntially face-threatening for the tutor. Given that\nexpertise is \u201calways subject to public evaluation\u201d\n(Summerson Carr, 2010, p. 21), the negotiation\nof a peer tutor\u2019s epistemic status of K+ requires\nongoing co-construction of this status by both the\ntutor and the learner.\n\nThe interactional and ideological nature of the-\nories on epistemics and expertise paves the way\nfor a context-focused approach to interactions re-\ngarding peer tutor knowledge. In the analysis of\nthe data to follow, I focus on epistemic search se-\nquences (ESSs) for lexical items. As described in\nJakonen & Morton (2015), ESSs are collective res-\nolutions of knowledge gaps. I limit my analysis to\nlexical items because they are usually more eas-\nily resolved (e.g., with a translation or circum-\nlocution) compared to morphological or syntac-\ntic items, which often result in more extensive\nand explicit grammatical explanations. For this\nreason, lexical ESSs unknown to the tutor could\npresent more of a challenge to a tutor\u2019s epistemic\nstatus, due to their inability to answer as quickly as\nto a known lexical item.\n\nHere, I present a brief example of a lexical\nESS that was successfully resolved by the peer tu-\ntor. (See the Appendix for transcription conven-\ntions.)\n\nEXCERPT 1: \u201cVentajas\u201d\n\n1 Alice:\n\n2 Lorena:\n\n3\n\n4 Alice:\n\nventajas?  \u030ais that wind \u030a?\nadvantages\num: ventajas es algo bueno.\nadvantages is something good\nthe um-plus >the pros<\n((puts two thumbs up))\n \u030aoh ok \u030a\n\nAs seen in this excerpt, resolved ESSs are fre-\nquently negotiated with the provision of an equiv-\nalent in the opposite language from the request,\nan explanation of the word in Spanish, gestures,\nor a combination of these strategies. Here, Alice\u2019s\nconfusion of ventajas [advantages] with a similar\nsounding word in Spanish, viento [wind], was not\nexplicitly addressed by Lorena. Instead, Lorena\nused an explanation (\u201cventajas es algo bueno\u201d), an\n\nThe Modern Language Journal 100 (2016)\n\nEnglish translation (\u201cplus\u201d \u201cthe pros\u201d), and a ges-\nture (two thumbs up) to resolve Alice\u2019s initiated\nlexical ESS. Alice\u2019s uptake of this resolution is ev-\nident from her utterance, \u201coh ok\u201d in 4.\n\nIn this study I distinguish between resolved, un-\nresolved, and semi-resolved ESSs. The distinction of\nresolved versus unresolved parallels Jakonen and\nMorton\u2019s (2015) response types in ESSs, in which\nresolved sequences are interactions in which a\n\u201cknowing\u201d response is accepted, and unresolved\nsequences are interactions with an \u201cunknowing\u201d\nresponse, or in which the search is not taken up.\nTo this framework I add a third category, semi-\nresolved, which indicates that a knowing response\nhas been accepted, but that there is some doubt\non the part of the tutor regarding its accuracy, as\nevidenced by the use of mitigations.\n\nThe examination of the three ESSs to follow\nuses a close discourse analysis to outline, turn by\nturn, how these ESSs were negotiated in inter-\naction, as well as how participants aligned to tu-\ntor and learner constructions of expertise. Before\nthis, I provide additional contextual information\non the participants and the peer tutoring setting.\n\nSETTING AND PARTICIPANTS\n\nThe data from this study come from a larger\ndata set of peer tutoring sessions from the Span-\nish department of a mid-sized public university\nin southern California. At the time of the study,\napproximately 30% of the undergraduate stu-\ndents at the university identified as Hispanic or\nLatino. Many of these students decided to ma-\njor in Spanish, or had close contacts with other\nSpanish majors. Given this rich group of poten-\ntial tutors, and given a lack of resources for de-\nveloping a language laboratory, the department\ncreated a peer tutoring program for beginning\nSpanish speakers to practice their oral commu-\nnication skills with what the department labeled\n\u2018native\u2019 Spanish speakers, generally self-identified\nHispanic/Latino junior or senior year students.\nThe application process to become a peer tutor\nwas fairly informal; interested students would talk\nto the department\u2019s language program coordina-\ntor, who would assess their language skills and as-\nsign them to time slots during the quarter. Peer\ntutors earned independent study credits for their\nparticipation.\n\nParticipation in this program was mandatory\nfor students in the first through sixth quarters\nof Spanish language courses, which constituted\nthe first 2 years of Spanish at the university. As\npart of their oral practice grade, each student was\nleast one peer\nrequired to sign up for at\n\n\fMichele Back\n\ntutoring session per week. An excerpt from the de-\npartment\u2019s Spanish 1\u20136 syllabus further outlines\nthe requirements and restrictions:\n\nOral Practice: You may sign up for oral practice. This\nwill be conducted by native speakers. This time is not to be\nused for written homework, assignments or composi-\ntions. Do not ask the tutors for help with these assignments,\nas it will be considered unauthorized collaboration.\n(my emphases, Spanish 1\u20136 syllabus, April 2011)\n\nPeer tutors were provided with written mate-\nrials for scaffolding oral practice sessions with\nthe students. These materials included conver-\nsation questions, pronunciation exercises, and\nshort readings. Generally, peer tutoring sessions\nfor the lower levels (Spanish 1\u20133) adhered strictly\nto the oral practice materials. However, sessions\nfor Spanish 4\u20136 were more open; many students\nsolicited tutor assistance in practicing oral presen-\ntations for class, even though this was explicitly\nforbidden in the syllabus. Peer tutors would also\noften lead the conversation in different directions\nfrom the practice materials, depending upon the\nproficiency of the learner.\n\nWith the assistance of several undergraduate\nstudent researchers, I collected video and audio\ndata from 43 peer tutoring sessions held during\nthe spring quarter of 2011. These sessions were\napproximately 45 minutes in length, and were\ncomposed of as few as one and as many as five\nlearners interacting with one peer tutor. In or-\nder to obtain better audio of the sessions, I sup-\nplemented the video with a digital voice recorder\nplaced on the tutoring table. After recording, an-\nother group of undergraduate students and my-\nself transcribed the audio and video data using\nconversation analysis (CA) transcription conven-\ntions (see the Appendix for a list of these conven-\ntions). This close discourse analysis included a fo-\ncus on discursive features of alignment, such as\noverlaps, intonation, and laughter, in addition to\nthe content of the interactions. Video data were\nalso transcribed and analyzed for multimodal ex-\npressions of alignment, including gesture, gaze,\nand the incorporation of artifacts such as cell\nphones and written oral practice materials.\n\nThe data for this study involve one peer tutor,\nLorena, and her peer learners, Rhonda and Al-\nice. Lorena was a senior and a Spanish major. Al-\nthough Lorena did not explicitly take up the iden-\ntity category of native speaker, in her interactions\nwith learners, including this cohort, she did pro-\nvide a great deal of information about her back-\nground, such as the fact that her mother was from\nMexico and her father was from Texas, but also\nspoke Spanish. She also frequently used the first\n\n513\n\nperson plural pronoun, \u201cwe,\u201d when referring to\nMexicans. This background information suggests\nan orientation to a heritage identity, if not that of\nnative speaker; that is, Lorena\u2019s comments on her\nfamily members and her own identity closely ref-\nerenced the fact that Spanish was at least one of\nher home languages.\n\nAs I began to examine the peer tutoring videos,\nI observed that Lorena\u2019s time at talk was quite\nhigh relative to other peer tutors. Lorena would\noften tell long, detailed stories about her child-\nhood, her friends, and her husband that were at\nbest tangentially related to the conversation top-\nics in the oral practice materials. These stories left\nlittle time for peer learners to interact and paral-\nleled previous findings regarding peer tutor dom-\ninance. Yet despite this dominance, the learners\ninitiated a great deal more ESSs with Lorena com-\npared to other peer tutor\u2013learner cohorts. This\nmay have been because Lorena, unlike many of\nthe other peer tutors, had a consistent tutoring\nschedule that allowed her to see the same groups\nof learners for several sessions over the course\nof the quarter. These repeated meetings played a\nrole in establishing familiarity and a more trusting\nenvironment, which would have allowed learners\nto feel more at ease in initiating ESSs.\n\nOne of Lorena\u2019s cohorts included Alice, an\nAsian-American student who was taking Spanish\n5; and Rhonda, an African-American senior who,\nlike Lorena, was a Spanish major. Lorena, Al-\nice, and Rhonda met at least five times over the\ncourse of the spring quarter; each of these five\nsessions was recorded. While Alice was clearly a\npeer learner in these sessions, Rhonda\u2019s role was\nless clear. Although Rhonda was one of the un-\ndergraduate researchers tasked with video record-\ning the tutoring sessions, she would often sit at\nthe table when Lorena was tutoring and partic-\nipate in the sessions, rather than simply turning\non the camera and leaving. Rhonda later told me\nher goal in participating was to practice her Span-\nish. It was also evident that she was friends with\nLorena, as they both would reference conversa-\ntions and events that had occurred outside of the\ntutoring sessions.\n\nThe unique nature of this particular peer tu-\ntoring cohort, with each participant possessing\nvaried identity categories of friend, learner, and\nexpert, motivated my interest in closely analyz-\ning how they negotiated knowledge among them-\nselves. As I show in the following section, par-\nticipants drew upon these identity categories, as\nwell as a variety of resources and histories, in\norder to resolve the lexical item and negotiate\ntheir respective epistemic stances. I selected three\n\n\f514\n\nThe Modern Language Journal 100 (2016)\n\ntypes of ESSs for a close discourse analysis: one\nresolved ESS for the word militares [military];\none unresolved ESS for the word carbo\u0301n [coal];\nand one semi-resolved ESS for mellizos [fraternal\ntwins]. The first two examples come from the first\nrecorded session, filmed at the beginning of the\nquarter, while the third example comes from the\nfourth recorded session, filmed at week six of the\nquarter.\n\nCO-CONSTRUCTING KNOWLEDGE\nAND EXPERTISE: THREE EXAMPLES\n\nIn their first recorded tutoring session, Lorena,\nRhonda, and Alice were discussing the advantages\nand disadvantages of living with one\u2019s parents, as\nprompted by the oral practice materials. Lorena\nwas translating a particular episode in her child-\nhood, which she had stated in Spanish in a pre-\nvious turn, when Rhonda began to construct an-\nother example in Spanish:\n\nEXCERPT 2: \u201cMilitares\u201d\n\n1 Lorena: my door,\n\n((gaze to Alice))\n\n<always had to be\nopen.>\n((opening door\ngesture with\nhand))\n\n2\n3 Rhonda: =y, a veces ahm, eran es- estricto?\n\n(.8) \u00b0always = \u00b0\n\n5 Rhonda: muy, porque a:a hhh (2.0) hhHHH\n\n4 Lorena:\n\n6 Lorena:\n\n7 Rhonda:\n\n8 Lorena: OH,\n\nand, sometimes they were strict\n((Lorena\u2019s gaze to Rhonda))\naha\n((nods))\n\nbecause very a:ahm\n(3.0) ahh\u2191huh,\n((maintains gaze on Rhonda))\n(3.0) mili- militario, (.)\n\n*military\nporque son, um =\nbecause they\u2019re\n((eyes widen, gaze upward))\n\n9 Rhonda: =yeah. hHHH\u2191\nson,\nson they\u2019re,\n10 Lorena:\nthey\u2019re ((hand on\nforehead))\n\ndel militar = from\nthe *military\n((gaze back to\nRhonda))\n\n11 Rhonda: =mhm yeah=\n12 Lorena: =son militant(.)tes? hhHH.they\u2019re\n\n13\n\nmilitant?\n((gaze to table, furrows brow))\nthat sounds ne[gative.]\n((gaze moves upward, hand to chin))\n\n14 Rhonda: [milio.] militares? m[mm]\n\nmilitary\n\n15 Lorena:\n\n16 Rhonda: ye[ah].\n17 Lorena: m[hm?]\n((nods))\n\n[mil]itares? military\n((gaze to Rhonda,\npoints to Rhonda))\n\nRhonda initiated the lexical ESS with a search\nfor the word \u201cmilitares\u201d in order to define why her\nown parents were so strict (5). Lorena ceded her\nturn to Rhonda for over 7 seconds, during which\nshe maintained her gaze on Rhonda. This period\nof time was punctuated only briefly by a laugh\nfrom Lorena as Rhonda continued to search for\nthe word. Lorena may not have offered immediate\nassistance because there was not enough context\navailable to provide a suggested word. Another\npossibility was that, due to Rhonda\u2019s status as a\nSpanish major and a friend, Lorena constructed\nRhonda\u2019s epistemic stance as a co-knower, rather\nthan a learner. When Rhonda produced an erro-\nneous utterance, \u201c*militario,\u201d (7), Lorena\u2019s gaze\nshifted upward as she began her own search. Her\nrepetition of \u201cson\u201d (they are), use of the filler\n\u201cum\u201d and pauses indicated she was also having\ntrouble producing the correct word. Her first\nattempt, \u201cmilitantes\u201d was produced hesitantly, as\nseen by the raised tone at the end and, in the\nvideo, a furrowed brow and continued gaze away\nfrom Rhonda.\n\nLorena confirmed that she was not happy\nwith this lexical item by her evaluative comment,\n\u201cthat\nsounds negative\u201d (13). When Rhonda\noffered \u201cmilio. militares\u201d in the following turn,\nLorena turned her gaze to Rhonda and re-\npeated the word \u201cmilitares,\u201d indicating what\nGreer et al., (2009) termed \u201creceipt through\nrepetition\u201d (p. 6). Lorena complemented this\nrepetition with embodied gestures of agree-\nment\nstretching her\nhand outwards toward Rhonda and nodding.\nBoth Rhonda and Lorena completed the ESS\nby continuing to co-construct agreement on\nthe chosen word through nods, affirmative\noverlapping utterances (\u201cyeah\u201d, \u201cmhm\u201d), and\nrepetition.\n\nand co-construction,\n\nIn this excerpt we see how Rhonda and Lorena\nco-constructed an acceptable lexical\nitem to\nprovide a rationale for Rhonda\u2019s assessment of\nher parents as strict. Lorena, despite her pre-\nscribed role as peer tutor, positioned Rhonda as\nan equal possessor of knowledge in this search\nby turning her gaze to Rhonda and allowing her\nto complete her turn over several seconds of\nsilence. Later, by providing a possible word that\n\n\fMichele Back\n\nshe immediately evaluated as unsatisfactory with\nher comment, \u201cthat sounds negative,\u201d Lorena\nreferenced the symbolic knowledge she had of\nthe term \u201cmilitante,\u201d which is normally used to\ndescribe revolutionaries and activists. Her ac-\nceptance of Rhonda\u2019s suggestion, \u201cmilitares,\u201d was\npunctuated by an outstretched, pointing gesture,\na nod, and an affirmative \u201cmhm?\u201d Despite not\nhaving provided the correct word, Lorena played\nan active part in the co-construction of this search\nsequence by ceding her turn to allow Rhonda\nample search time, incorporating her personal\nknowledge of \u201cmilitantes,\u201d and the use of her\noutstretched hand and nod to signal correctness\nof the term \u201cmilitares.\u201d\n\nThroughout this ESS, Alice did not participate,\nremaining silent until the topic had changed.\nHowever, Alice did initiate a lexical ESS a few min-\nutes after this particular sequence. Prompted by\na second conversation question regarding myths\nand legends, Alice began to recount the story of\nSanta Claus and his delivery of coal to misbehav-\ning boys and girls as an example of a myth. As\nshe continued, she became stuck on the Spanish\nequivalent of the lexical item \u201ccoal.\u201d Due to the\nlength of this excerpt I divide both it and the anal-\nysis into two parts.\n\nEXCERPT 3: \u201cCarbo\u0301n\u201d\n\n1 Alice:\n\n2 Lorena:\n3 Alice:\n\n4 Rhonda: HH[hh]\n5 Lorena:\n\neh, NO reciben\nregalos\nthey don\u2019t get presents\na[ha]\n[y,] reciben, um\n(1.5) coal\nand they get\n\n[co]al,una bolsa\nde:ehm\na bag of ((gaze to\ntable))\nlike =\n\n<\u2191how do you say\nCOAL?((gaze to\nRhonda, head tilt))\n\n6 Alice:\n7 Rhonda: =hH[HH]\n8 Alice:\n\n[I]used this word too =\n((gaze upward, rubs eye))\n\n=think, okay when we have a\nbarbecue:eh [HHH]\n((gaze upward, hand on chin))\n[hHHH]hh\n\n9 Lorena:\n\n10 Rhonda:\n\nAlice begins this ESS with a filler (\u201cum\u201d) and\npause (3), followed by a code switch into English\nthat indicated a lexical gap. Lorena\u2019s question,\n\u201chow do you say coal?,\u201d combined with a move-\nment of her gaze to Rhonda, again indicated a\npositioning of Rhonda\u2019s epistemic status as equal\n\n515\n\nto her own. Although Alice also attempted to\ncollaborate in resolving the ESS, as evidenced by\nher gaze upward (8) and the statement, \u201cI used\nthis word too,\u201d Lorena did not take up this at-\ntempt at collaboration with any sort of verbal\nor embodied acknowledgement. Instead, Lorena\nmoved her gaze upward (rather than toward Al-\nice) and referenced her own cultural knowledge\nin an attempt to find the correct word (\u201cokay,\nwhen we have a barbecue . . .\u201d). In subsequent\nturns (not transcribed here for reasons of space),\nLorena continued to draw upon cultural knowl-\nedge by mentioning several obscure Mexican city\nnames in response to Alice\u2019s joking suggestion of\npiedras negras [black rocks] as the Spanish equiva-\nlent for \u201ccoal.\u201d\n\nAfter a few seconds, Lorena incorporated both\nRhonda and Alice into the ESS by asking whether\nthey had the Google Internet search application\non their mobile phones. Alice and Lorena both\nvisibly initiated searches on their phones (Rhonda\nwas off camera and so it is unknown whether\nshe was also searching). After several seconds of\nsearching, Alice offered another suggestion for\n\u201ccoal\u201d:\n\n23 Alice:\n\ntrosss- o\n\ncarbo\u0301n?\ncoal?\n\n24 Lorena:\n\n25 Alice:\n26 Lorena:\n27 Alice:\n\n28 Lorena:\n\n((Lorena\u2019s gaze to Alice))\ncar- carBON \u2191WELL\ncoal ((moves both hands in opening\n\ngesture))\n(wano = )\n[ = agh]\n[bol]so de carbo\u0301n,\nbag of coal\nyour phone is much faster than mine\napparently\u2191\n\nLorena repeated Alice\u2019s suggestion, \u201ccarbo\u0301n,\u201d\nbut rejected the word\u2014and, subsequently, Alice\u2019s\nepistemic stance as knower\u2014with the statement\n\u201cwell\u201d in an upraised tone, opened hands, and a\nnoise of frustration (\u201cagh\u201d). Alice repeated the\nword in a collocation \u201cbolso de carbo\u0301n\u201d [bag of\ncoal], which Lorena again did not take up, com-\nmenting instead upon the relative speed of Alice\u2019s\nphone compared to hers. In a few more turns the\nconversation had shifted to other topics and the\nSpanish lexical item for \u201ccoal\u201d was never resolved.\nIn this exchange Lorena\u2019s epistemic stance\nfluctuated from claiming a lack of knowledge, to\ndrawing upon her own personal history in order\nto facilitate the ESS, to positioning herself as more\nknowledgeable than her designated peer learner\nby rejecting a suggested lexical item. Lorena\u2019s\n\n\f516\n\ninitial downgrading of her own knowledge did\nnot disengage her from her status as expert; in-\ndeed, knowing participants often downgrade the\nepistemics of their responses (Jakonen & Morton,\n2015). At the same time, Lorena\u2019s incorporation\nof her cultural knowledge of barbecue-related\nterms in Spanish served to mediate her epistemic\nstance as knower. This stance was co-constructed\nby Alice and, possibly, Rhonda; despite the fact\nthat Alice found \u201ccarbo\u0301n\u201d on a neutral search\nengine (and despite the fact that carbo\u0301n is, in fact,\nthe Spanish equivalent for coal), Lorena\u2019s own\ndoubt as expert led to a lack of resolution of the\nESS.\n\nAs Summerson Carr (2010) noted, one ele-\nment of expertise is the assumption that oth-\ners are less knowledgeable. In the discussion\non \u201ccoal,\u201d Lorena negotiated her expert role\nand cultural knowledge to position herself as\ndoubtful about Alice\u2019s own claims to knowledge,\neven though these claims were assisted by an\nartifactual, outside source. Alice accepted this\nevaluation and even co-constructed doubt with\nLorena with an upraised tone at her suggestion of\n\u201ccarbo\u0301n?\u201d (23) and by not pressing the issue fur-\nther once Lorena\u2019s own phone failed to turn up\nthe desired word. Thus, despite an inability to\nmake her own claim to knowledge of the correct\nSpanish word, Lorena\u2019s gestures, claims to cul-\ntural knowledge, and rejection of Alice\u2019s sugges-\ntion, combined with Alice\u2019s alignment to these ac-\ntions, allowed her to maintain an epistemic status\nof expert within the cohort. We could also say that\nRhonda, although off camera, also showed align-\nment with her lack of participation and silences,\nwhich implied agreement with Lorena\u2019s rejection\nof \u201ccarbo\u0301n.\u201d\n\nIn the final excerpt we see Lorena\u2019s contin-\nued construction of an expert identity during a\nvocabulary activity. While reading from a list of\nwords relevant to an assignment from Alice\u2019s class,\nLorena came upon the word mellizos [fraternal\ntwins]. What followed was a brief monologue on\nthe term, in which she again attempted to engage\nRhonda in a lexical search:\n\nEXCERPT 4: \u201cMellizos\u201d\n\n2\n\n1 Lorena: mellizos, mellizos! i\u2019ve NEVER heard\nmellizos ((gaze on text))\nfor twins. i\u2019ve heard,\num (.)\n<there\u2019s another\none.> (3.5)\n((gaze back to paper))\nGEMELOS. (1.0)\n\ncuates, a:and\n((gaze to Rhonda))\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nThe Modern Language Journal 100 (2016)\n\n\u00b0yeah\u00b0.\n((gaze back to\nRhonda, nods))\n\n<<those are the\nones I\u2019ve heard\n((index finger up\nbriefly))\n\nbut I\u2019ve never heard\nmellizos.>\n\nIn this monologue Lorena first expressed sur-\nprise at the term \u201cmellizos,\u201d then used a negative\nbooster (\u201cnever\u201d) to emphasize her not having\nheard the term. In 2\u20134, she volunteered the lex-\nical items that she had heard for \u201ctwins,\u201d which\nincluded the Mexican Spanish \u201ccuates\u201d for fra-\nternal twins (from the Na\u0301huatl word coatl) and\n\u201cgemelos,\u201d or identical twins. During this mono-\nlogue Lorena turned her gaze to Rhonda twice,\nperhaps hoping to co-construct and then con-\nfirm the lexical item \u201cgemelos,\u201d similar to how \u201cmil-\nitares\u201d was achieved. However, Rhonda did not\ntake up this invitation\u2014or, at least, her reaction\nwas inaudible\u2014and Lorena produced the item\non her own after a few seconds. Note again that\nAlice, as the designated peer learner in this se-\nquence, and despite the fact that she had been\ninvolved in discussing the text in prior turns, was\nnot drawn into the negotiation for the word \u201cgeme-\nlos,\u201d nor did she offer suggestions. Lorena\u2019s com-\nment, \u201cthose are the ones I\u2019ve heard,\u201d paired with\na pointing gesture outwards, again incorporated\nher historic and symbolic knowledge into her epis-\ntemic stance. Similar to Excerpt 3, by claiming\nwhat she did know, Lorena was able to downplay\nher lack of comprehension of lexical items she\ndid not know, thus continuing to negotiate a supe-\nrior epistemic stance. Moreover, by indexing this\nhistoric, cultural, and symbolic knowledge as be-\nlonging not only to her, but to a collective com-\nmunity, Lorena effectively \u2018devoiced\u2019 this knowl-\nedge and rendered it as expertise (Summerson\nCarr, 2010, p. 25). Again, the lack of verbal or em-\nbodied contribution from either Rhonda or Alice\nserved to align them to the perception of the word\n\u201cmellizos\u201d as something unheard of or unusual.\n\nIn these excerpts we note a complex array\nof overlapping resources, from symbolic to arti-\nfactual to embodied, to co-construct knowledge\nand expertise. Though Lorena engaged actively\nwith the other two participants, each was con-\nstructed differently with respect to their epistemic\nstance. At the same time, Rhonda and Alice ap-\npeared to construct Lorena unreservedly as the\nexpert during these sequences, even when Lorena\nattempted to draw Rhonda into various ESSs,\nor when artifactual resources conflicted with\nLorena\u2019s assessments. These disconnects carry\n\n\fMichele Back\n\nsome important implications regarding the con-\nsequences of perceived expertise and the implica-\ntions for language learning, peer tutoring, and in-\nterlocutor epistemics. I discuss these issues in the\nnext section.\n\nDISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS\n\nAlthough Summerson Carr (2010) has stated\nthat it is mostly up to the would-be expert to\nsuccessfully enact expertise,\nincorporating no-\ntions of epistemic stance and status allows us to\nsee how knowledge and expertise are instead co-\nconstructed in interaction. In the peer tutoring\ncohort examined here, Lorena did establish an\ninterpretive frame of expert through the incorpo-\nration of personal history, devoicing, and various\nembodied strategies, all of which indexed her\nright to know. Working through her own lexical\ngaps, Lorena was able to successfully negotiate\nthe overlapping epistemic domains of artifactual\nresources, such as the text and an Internet search\nwith her own domain of knowledge, affirming\nthose resources that she knew and discarding\nor ignoring those that she did not know. Both\nRhonda and Alice demonstrated alignment with\nLorena\u2019s epistemic stance by allowing Lorena to\nhold the floor during most negotiations of ESSs\nand giving her the final say on lexical searches.\nThese findings support previous findings by\nThonus (2004) and Bell & Elledge (2008) re-\ngarding peer tutor dominance and perceptions\nof tutors as higher\u2013status interlocutors.\n\nHowever, Lorena also employed several at-\ntempts at collaboration with Rhonda in order to\nnegotiate certain lexical items. Although this led\nto the successful resolution of one word, \u201cmil-\nitares,\u201d Rhonda did not take up subsequent col-\nlaborations. This could be because Rhonda, as\nevidenced by her own goals to practice Span-\nish, had determined her epistemic status as a\nsort of \u2018expert novice,\u2019 somewhere on the con-\ntinuum between Alice\u2019s novice learner identity\nand Lorena\u2019s expert status. Lorena\u2019s attempts to\nconstruct Rhonda as a co-expert conflicted with\nRhonda\u2019s own perception of her status, leading to\na lack of collaboration on ESSs. Rhonda\u2019s efforts\nto resolve \u201cmilitares\u201d may have been due to the fact\nthat she initiated the search for that lexical item.\nWhen the search was initiated by either Alice or\nLorena, as in the cases of \u201ccarbo\u0301n\u201d and \u201cmellizos,\u201d\nRhonda perhaps felt that she would overstep her\nliminal role of expert novice if she contributed.\nThis failed collaboration again points to the con-\ntextual nature of negotiating expertise, and sug-\ngests that perceptions of tutors as higher status\n\n517\n\ninterlocutors contain strong ideologies of hierar-\nchy and, in the case of language tutoring, essen-\ntialized conceptions of so-called \u2019native speakers.\u2019\nIn other words, Lorena\u2019s position as peer tutor,\ncombined with references to her personal history\nas a speaker of Spanish, may have led Rhonda\nand Alice to limit their engagement during res-\nolutions of ESSs.\n\nThese findings highlight not only the context-\nsensitive nature of epistemic stance and status,\nbut also of target language knowledge itself.\nLorena\u2019s multiple references to her personal\nhistory and what she had \u2018heard\u2019 or witnessed in\nher past point to the symbolic, ideological, and\ncontext-specific nature of linguistic and cultural\nknowledge. As Song and Kellogg (2011) stated,\n\u201c[f]oreign language word meanings appear to\nbe palimpsests of different layers of meaning:\niconic, indexical, and, ultimately, symbolic and\nsignifying\u201d (p. 589). As demonstrated by Lorena\u2019s\nmonologue on the word \u201cmellizos,\u201d there are\npotentially multiple versions of certain lexical\nitems, particularly in a global language such as\nSpanish. Although these palimpsests were slightly\ndisturbed by the appearance of a new word or\nmeaning, resulting in the multiple ESSs discussed\nin this article, Lorena favored her own historical\nknowledge of these words over artifactual sources\nin order to construct her epistemic stance as\nknower. Lorena\u2019s favoring of \u201ccuates\u201d over \u201cmel-\nlizos\u201d is potentially enriching knowledge for her\nlearners, but also speaks to the need for more\narticulation between classroom and peer tutoring\nsessions regarding which variety of Spanish is\nbeing taught. A more comprehensive training\nprogram for peer tutors that addresses language\nvarieties taught in the classroom would help to ad-\ndress these and other trouble sequences in peer\ntutoring interactions by aligning bodies of knowl-\nedge between the two environments. Moreover,\nthe trouble sequences analyzed here suggest that\nboth peer tutors and classroom teachers would\nbenefit learners by providing them with strategies\nfor negotiating words with multiple equivalents\nin Spanish, especially given that most learners fre-\nquently anticipate a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween one language and another.\n\nAdditional implications of this case study for\npeer tutoring in additional languages include rec-\nognizing the socialized processes of mediating\nexpertise and epistemic status. This study high-\nlighted how Lorena\u2019s learners readily adopted\nand maintained the norms of expert\u2013novice in-\nteraction, even when Lorena solicited help. More-\nover, Lorena\u2019s rejection of Alice\u2019s few contribu-\ntions also reinforced an expert\u2013novice dichotomy,\n\n\f518\n\neven when artifactual knowledge (e.g., the Google\nsearch results, the vocabulary reading) conflicted\nwith Lorena\u2019s assertions. This dichotomy could be\ndisrupted by training tutors in cooperative learn-\ning methods, in which they actively adopt a role of\nfacilitator rather than language expert, thus open-\ning the door to more opportunities to negotiate\nmeaning on an equal level with their learners. An-\nother possible disruption to this dichotomy would\nbe to have more than one tutor in peer tutor-\ning sessions, which could provide an extra source\nof knowledge for negotiating grammatical, prag-\nmatic, cultural, and lexical items. This latter sug-\ngestion could also work as a training method for\npeer tutors, pairing one peer tutor with a more\nexperienced one so that the novice tutor may ob-\nserve, internalize, and imitate cooperative learn-\ning methods and ways of articulating expertise.\n\nFinally, the interactions in this study highlight\nthe ideological nature of expertise, as each par-\nticipant displayed her own assumptions regarding\nLorena\u2019s right to know, either through a reluc-\ntance to participate as co-knower (Rhonda) or an\nacceptance, evidenced by silences, of ESSs where\nalternative possibilities were discovered (Alice).\nThrough these hesitations, Rhonda and Alice co-\nconstructed Lorena, a self-identified speaker of\nSpanish as a home language, as the default expert.\nThese co-constructions parallel previous findings\non assumptions regarding native speaker abilities,\nwhich may in turn be rooted in ideologies of racial\nand ethnic essentialism. Because these ideologies\nwere not explicitly oriented to in the interactions,\nwe cannot say with certainty that Rhonda and Al-\nice\u2019s perceptions of Lorena as an expert were in\nany way related to perceptions of her ethnic iden-\ntity. Nevertheless, it is an important potential con-\nnection for future research, which could expand\nupon recent studies on how race and language\nabilities are often conflated (e.g., Flores & Rosa,\n2015). Challenging assumptions that are rooted\nin\u2014at the very least\u2014essentialist conceptions of\ninterlocutor expertise could lead to more egali-\ntarian and productive negotiations of meaning, as\nwell as peer tutors who are more savvy and skilled\nat both communicating their own expertise and\nrecognizing the expertise of others.\n\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH\n\nThroughout this study I have emphasized the\ninteractional nature of knowledge\ncontextual,\nand expertise as a response to the essentialized\nperceptions of knowledge in previous studies on\npeer tutoring. Given that this is a case study, it is\nnot my intention to generalize these findings to\n\nThe Modern Language Journal 100 (2016)\n\nother peer tutoring settings, even to those within\nmy own, larger data set. However, it is my hope\nthat this study will motivate others to further ex-\nplore how knowledge is enacted and negotiated\namong peer tutoring cohorts, in this way contin-\nuing to outline the complex overlays of history,\nideology, and socialization practices that charac-\nterize the knowledge of any given language. Peer\ntutoring in additional language learning offers\na unique environment for exposure to these\noverlays; however, the perception of peer tutors\nas a homogeneous group of \u2018experts\u2019 limits our\nunderstanding of epistemic complexity, just as\nperceptions of \u2018one\u2019 target language and culture\nrestrict our ability to negotiate the global reality\nof linguistic and cultural heterogeneity. With this\nstudy I hope to begin a dialogue on how we can\ntake advantage of the rich linguistic and cultural\ncomplexity of peer tutors, while at the same time\ndiscussing how training might give them the\nnecessary tools to negotiate this complexity in\nmeaningful and egalitarian ways. It is quite clear\nfrom this study and others that the current trend\nof leaving peer tutoring to the so-called \u2018experts\u2019\nreduces its benefit for learners and tutors alike.\n\nLast, it is hoped that further research will also\ndelve deeper into the whys of homogenous per-\nceptions of linguistic expertise, including an anal-\nysis of how identity categories such as race and\nethnicity relate to this perception, as well as the\nmyths that continue to surround the native and\nnonnative speaker. Similar to the benefits of dif-\nferentiating instruction for language learners, by\nrecognizing the differences in knowledge that in-\nterlocutors bring to interactions, we can learn to\naccommodate these differences, while still appre-\nciating the unique awareness that peer tutors and\nother interlocutors contribute to additional lan-\nguage learning.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nAn earlier version of this article was presented at the\n4th Meeting of the Language and Social Interaction\nWorking Group (New York, NY) and at the 2014 Second\nLanguage Research Forum (Columbia, SC).

Introduction\n\nSimulation is a supportive educational methodology, which dupli-\ncates situations not possible with real patients. Simulation replicates\nreal clinical conditions to provide students with the opportunity to\nacquire skills by combining theory and practice, with decision-making\nwithout the possibility of causing actual patients harm (Khalaila, 2014).\nBased on the potential benefits of simulation, many schools are re-\ncommending application throughout the nursing curriculum (Gore and\nSchuessler, 2013; O'Donnell et al., 2014). Chinese educators use simu-\nlation as a revolutionary education strategy to support the efforts of\npreparing students for practice in the complex clinical settings (Wang\net al., 2013; You et al., 2015). However, challenges confront students\nwhen undertaking simulation such as scenarios can be stressful, some\nstudents might suffer cognitive burnout because of the demand of\npreparation and progressive learning, they may have difficulty distin-\nguishing between reality and simulation, or simulation may interfere\nwith the students' development of professional socialization and\n\ncommunication skills for lack of association with other nurses and\nmedical staff (Larue et al., 2015). In China, the lack of qualified faculty\nand large class size exacerbate this challenge (Wang et al., 2013).\n\nPeer tutoring has been defined as a collaborative learning inter-\nvention in which individuals, who are not professional teachers from\nsimilar settings, help each other to learn through teaching (Topping,\n1996). Researchers have used peer tutoring to supplement and achieve\nthe maximum outcome from clinical simulation (Kim-Godwin et al.,\n2013; Owen and Ward-Smith, 2014). Peer tutoring has been found to be\nappropriate for use in simulation, reportedly enjoying high rating from\nthe majority of students who attest that peer tutoring is an effective\napproach to meeting their learning needs (Ramm et al., 2015; Szlachta,\n2013). Peer tutoring provides students with opportunities to learn from\nand self-reflection\npeer\n(Brannagan et al., 2013). Exploring undergraduate students' feelings\nand perspectives may provide helpful insights into how to develop and\nimprove impactful clinical teaching strategies in nursing education\n(Sharif and Masoumi, 2005). However, there is a dearth of studies\n\nthrough observation,\n\nfeedback,\n\ntutors\n\n\u2606\n\n\u204e\n\nNo conflict of interest has been declared by the authors.\nCorresponding author at: Chiang Mai University Chiang Mai Thailand.\nE-mail addresses: 2845map@gmail.com (M.A. Petrini), teriston@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp (T.E.

This study was designed to ascertain the perspectives of\nbaccalaureate nursing students toward the peer tutoring in the simu-\nlation laboratory.\n\n2. Methods\n\nQ methodology created by Stephenson (1935), uniquely synthesizes\nthe qualitative and quantitative methods (Brown, 1993). The qualita-\ntive aspects of Q-methodology allow the exploration of participants'\nsubjective views and the quantitative parts provide in-depth insights\ninto the opinion formation procedure by factor analysis (Watts and\nStenner, 2012).\n\n2.1. Research Procedure\n\nanalyze the Q-sort data. Principal components analysis and further\nvarimax rotation were computed. The Kaiser-Guttman criterion that\nsuggests that factors with eigenvalues larger than one should be ex-\ntracted and the results of the parallel analysis (Watts and Stenner,\n2012) were both considered for deciding how many factors to retain.\nGuided by the parallel analysis, the eigenvalues from the research data\nwere compared to the eigenvalues extracted from the random data\nabout the number of participants and the number of Q items. Three\nfactors were retained because the third eigenvalue from the research\ndata is greater than the third eigenvalue from the random data\n(O'Connor, 2000) (Table 1). Z-scores were adopted as a level of stan-\ndard deviation. The statements with Z-scores above + 1.0 were con-\nsidered as positive views and less than \u2212 1.0 as negative views (Cai\net al., 2016). All participants' comments were transferred word for word\nand then read and re-read to identify similarities, distinctions, and\npossible explanations (Stone et al., 2016).\n\n2.1.1. Creating Concourse and the Q-set\n\n2.1.5. Validity and Reliability\n\nThe concourse is a list of statements used to express perspectives on\nspecific subjects (Bartlett and DeWeese, 2014). The original statements\nfor this research were gathered through a review of the literature re-\nlated to peer tutoring employed in nursing or medical education. The\nfocus was on peer tutoring utilized in the simulation laboratory be-\ntween 2000 and 2015 using the search terms \u201cpeer tutoring,\u201d \u201cpeer\nteaching,\u201d \u201cpeer-assisted learning,\u201d \u201cpeer mentoring,\u201d \u201ccollaborating\nlearning\u201d and \u201ccollaborative study.\u201d\n\nThe concourse comprised 79 statements focusing on non-academic\nbenefits of peer tutoring in laboratory-based simulation; academic\noutcomes; metacognition and collaboration. The reduction of these 79\nstatements to a Q set of 58 items was accomplished by eliminating\noverlapping and ambiguous items in conjunction with three educa-\ntional experts and two nursing professors who were also the metho-\ndological experts. After a pilot study was done with seven participants,\n58 statements were retained.\n\n2.1.2. Selecting P-set\n\nThe P-set is the participant: following Van Exel and de Graaf (2005),\na convenient sample of 58 nursing students were recruited for the P set\nfrom the HOPE School of Nursing, Wuhan University, China. All the 58\nstudents signed the informed consent and were willing to participate in\nthe peer tutoring program. Seven students who participated in the pilot\nstudy were excluded from the main study. The class schedule prevented\n11 students from participation in the peer tutoring in the simulation\nlaboratory. Therefore, only 40 participants were enrolled and com-\npleted the study. Of the 40 participants, 37 were female, and three were\nmale with ages ranging from 18 to 22 years old (Table 2).The partici-\npants were evenly divided between first-year and third-year bacca-\nlaureate nursing students. All participants met the inclusion criteria\nthat they were enrolled baccalaureate students who had no prior ex-\nperiences of peer tutoring in the simulation laboratory.\n\n2.1.3. Conducting Q-sort\n\nAll participants were interviewed between April and June 2016.\nOne independent researcher undertook the data collection. The inter-\nviews took about 60 min individually and were conducted in a quiet\noffice in the university or the hospital. Each interview was recorded.\nEach participant separately was invited first to read the randomly\nnumbered Q-statements cards and then rank order of cards onto a\nforced normal distribution Q-sort table. The predesigned Q-sort chart\n(Fig. 1) used an 11-point bipolar scale form with a range from \u2212 5\n(strongly disagree) to +5 (strongly agree). After each Q-sort, each\nparticipant was interviewed about his/her thoughts about Q-sort\nchoices.\n\n2.1.4. Data Analysis and Factor Interpretation\n\nThe freeware PQ Method version 2.35 (Schmolk, 2014) was used to\n\nThe validity of Q study consists of content, face and Q-sorting va-\nlidity (Watts and Stenner, 2012). The content validity was established\nby the literature review and experts consultation. A team of domain\nexperts, containing two expat nursing professors that are also the\nmethodologists, and three Chinese educators assessed the items. These\ndomain experts evaluated the final panel of Q-samples and piloted by\nseven undergraduate nursing students for face and Q-sorting validity. In\nQ methodology, the most important type of reliability is whether the\nsame people will produce the same results over time. However, through\na test-retest procedure, the reliability of Q-sorting is verified by same Q-\nsample and individuals (Brown, 1993).\n\n2.1.6. Ethical Considerations\n\nResearch ethical approval was obtained from the Research Ethics\nCommittee of\nthe HOPE School of Nursing (Wuhan University,\nNo.2014-12-04-msn-03). Before the study, all students were provided\nwith a written and verbal explanation of peer tutoring program in the\nsimulation laboratory and the purpose of the Q study. The study ob-\njectives and students' rights were provided in Chinese, including their\nrights to withdraw from the study without penalty and that all the in-\nformation gathered would be treated confidentially and anonymously.\n\n3. Results\n\nThree factors emerged: \u201cFacilitate or empower\u201d knowledge acqui-\nsition (Factor I), \u201cSafety Net\u201d Supportive environment (Factor II), and\n\u201cMentoring\u201d learn how to learn (Factor III). The three factors accounted\nfor 34.4% of the variance, including Factor I (18.6%), Factor II (8.3%),\nand Factor III (7.6%). The eigenvalues were 7.44, 3.31 and 3.03 re-\n\u2018Thirty-six participants' responses determined the three\nspectively.\nfactors: nineteen exemplified Factor I, ten generated Factor II and seven\ncreated Factor III.\u2019\n\n3.1.1.

Students in Factor I agree that \u201cpeer tutoring offered em-\nbellishment enhanced comprehension of a clinical situation\u201d (+4), and\npeer tutors \u201cfrequently paraphrased learning\u201d (+ 3), engaged them \u201cto\nseek clarification\u201d (+ 3). Peer tutoring, a non-traditional teaching\nstrategy allowed many students to engage in learning (Item 56, + 3).\nOn the other hand, students in Factor I oppose the ideas that the net-\nworks developed through peer tutoring fostered their sense of be-\nlonging (\u2212 4). Also, the Factor 1 group did not think when facing dif-\nficulties; peer tutors were the preferred point of contact (\u2212 4).\nHowever, these students would like to access knowledge support from\npeer tutors, they thought peer tutors had \u201cthe same deep understanding\n\n236\n\n\fT.

Factor II: \u201cSafety Net\u201d Supportive Environment\n\nThirty-one distinguishing statements loaded in Factor II (Table 3).\nStudents loaded on this factor strongly agreed that peer tutoring created\na positive, non-intimidating learning environment for them (+ 5) and\nthey felt free to ask questions (+5). It was noticeable that students in\nthis group believed that peer tutoring supported the development of a\nnetwork (+ 2), which fostered the integration of students into their\ncommunity (+2) and sense of belonging (+ 1). Peer tutors were pre-\nferred options to seeking help (+ 2) and facilitate the development of\nother support (NPI333YA). Students loaded on this factor strongly\ndisagreed with the statements \u201cpeer tutoring provided scaffolding\nlearning\u201d (\u2212 5), \u201cpeer tutoring in the simulation laboratory provided\norientation\u201d (\u2212 4), \u201cpeer tutors clarified complex issues for them\u201d (\u22124)\nand peer tutoring increased their responsibility to prepare for simula-\ntion (\u2212 4).\n\nStudent comments that support the concept of a supportive en-\n\nvironment included:\n\n\u201cThe friendship is imperative. Developing one contact sometimes\nmeans many. Contacts often bring you a lot of ideas and resources to\nsolve problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope we can have more opportunities to participate in the col-\nlaborative study; then we will have a real friendship with each\nother. If I meet some problems, I can ask other for ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer to contact with peer tutors. We are all students, so I dare to\ndiscuss more topics with them.

well-trained teachers.\n29 The feedback I received from my peer tutor was helpful.\n30 I think peer tutoring increased the students' enthusiasm for learning.\n31 I think peer tutoring helped me to develop a more personal interest in the subject.\n32 I have found increased meaningfulness of the subject with the help of peer tutors.\n33 I could see the course in a more favorable light by the peer tutoring.\n34 I could evaluate the course (NPI1/3) more positively by the peer tutoring.\n35 Having been taught by peer tutor increased my sense of responsibility to prepare to practice.\n36 My ability to solve problems and think critically had been improved with the help of peer tutor.\n37 I could gain insight into how my peer tutor approached similar clinical problems.\n38 It was from the peer tutor's extra experience that I realized that there is always something to learn.\n39 Self-motivated peer tutors have an understanding of the course requirements\n40 Peer tutoring provided openness for students to ask questions.\n41 I think peer tutoring in the simulation laboratory provided orientation.\n42 It was hard for me to share my anxieties (e.g., fear of mistakes, inadequacy) with peer tutors in the simulation laboratory.\n43 My knowledge level of the clinical skill/procedure has been increased because of the support of my peer tutor.\n44 Peer tutoring increased our time spent on task so that we can discuss in-depth about the experience.\n45 Peer tutors enabled us to become more aware of our strengths and weaknesses.\n46 I found I learned from other people (peer tutor) explaining things and commenting on various approaches potential outcomes would be done.\n\nFor me peer tutoring is an excellent way to learn.\n\n47 Peer tutoring facilitated my validation of comprehension.\n48 I think peer tutoring offered embellishments that enhanced comprehension of the clinical situation.\n49 I think peer tutoring in the simulation laboratory optimized the scope of scholarly endeavor.\n50 I think peer tutoring provided scaffolding learning.\n51 I think peer tutors transferred professional values to students.\n52 The peer tutor prompted me to generate more higher-level thinking questions and responses.\n53 I think the discussion in or out of the simulation could be further fostered and optimized by the tutors' thought-provoking questions.\n54 With the support of peer tutor, I would critically (re)consider my interpretations and presumably become aware of the need to permanently\n\nmonitor my comprehension.\n\n55 I think peer tutoring led to more significant student participation in learning.\n56 I think peer tutoring allowed multiple students to work on non-traditional approaches to learning.\n57 I think peer tutors are the student's preferred point of contact when facing difficulty.\n58 I prefer regular contact with the same peer tutor throughout the program.\n\nNote: Bold indicates significance at P < 0.05; asterisk (*)

Factor III: \u201cMentoring\u201d Learn How to Learn\n\nFactor III determined by 34 distinguishing statements (Table 3).\nStudents in this group also agreed with that peer tutoring allowed many\nstudents to learn in this non-traditional approach and peer tutors\n\n238\n\nprovided a positive, satisfactory environment. Significantly, students\nloaded on this factor considered that peer tutoring influenced their\ncommunication skill (+ 4), improving their ability to solve problems\nand think critically (+3), and they would critically reconsider their\nlearning (+3). Students loaded on this factor hoped that they could\nhave more opportunities to study with different peer tutors (Item 58,\n\n\fT. Li et al.\n\nNurse Education Today 61 (2018) 235\u2013241\n\n\u2212 4). Factor III students strongly disagree with the saying that the\nsupport inherent in peer tutoring were significant to baccalaureate\nstudents (\u2212 5). If the students met difficulties, peer tutors were not the\nfirst choice for them (\u2212 5). Moreover, the students did not support the\ncollaborative study with peer tutors (Item 58, \u2212 4; Item 15, \u22124).\nComments from the students about this factor include:\n\n\u201cSometimes more urgent than complementing knowledge is that you\ndo not know how to get started with your preparation. Peer tutors\nguide you how to deal with this kind of problem which is based on\ntheir experiences. Later, the preparations become more efficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome peer tutors who like to share and guide. They are good at\nstudy. A collaborate study with them, allows me to learn from them\non how to study.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe peer tutors are very helpful. I have realized that there are lots\nof things I need to learn...I need to study harder.\u201d\n\n(NPI112YB)\n\n(NPI37JA3)\n\n(NPI119LA)\n\n3.1.4. Consensus Statements\n\nThere were five items (28, 37, 43, 52 and 55) with which the ma-\njority of the students agreed or disagreed. All the students moderately\nagreed with statement 28 and 55: \u201cpeer tutors are competent and well-\ntrained teachers\u201d and \u201cI think peer tutoring led to greater student\nparticipation in learning.\u201d All moderately disagreed with three state-\nments (37, 43 and 52), which implies that the students were not aware\nof the role of the peer tutors. Interview data indicated that most par-\nticipants thought study with peer tutors was a new experience and\nmany expressed a desire for more opportunities to use this method of\nteaching.\n\n4. Discussion\n\n4.1. Factor I: \u201cFacilitate or Empower\u201d Knowledge Acquisition\n\nFactor I students regarded peers as an effective way of promoting\nknowledge acquisition. Traditionally in China teaching is lecture and\nrote memorization, which aids the student to pass the test but not ne-\ncessarily retain the knowledge or be effective at critical thinking. Factor\nI reflects the use of peer tutoring with simulation to promote self-suf-\nficiency and empower students to be active participants in the acqui-\nsition of knowledge. Participants reported that peer tutors have recent\nexperience in studying the relevant material and understand issues the\nbaccalaureate students need to confront and resolve. Peer tutoring\nprovides the learners with a way of reinforcing their new learning and\nassists them to adapt to the simulation experience, which was beneficial\nfor the learners' ability to attain desirable outcomes of learning.\n\nThe results are consistent with those presented in other studies that\npeer tutoring will facilitate knowledge acquisition. Mills et al. (2014)\ninvestigated the baccalaureate students' experiences of attending a peer\ntutoring in a simulation suite: the majority of baccalaureate students\ngained from the collaborative peer tutoring study offered by studying\ntogether with more experienced peer tutors. Peer tutoring gave students\nthe chance to discover their inadequacies, correct misunderstandings\nand encourage the openness to others' ideas (Loke and Chow, 2007). As\nRamm et al. (2015) reported in the teaching processes, peer tutors had\nthe opportunities to integrate their experience of learning the similar\ncontents, enabling tutees to achieve a better understanding of learning\nthe material and promoting more in-depth understanding of course\nconcepts.\n\nMost students loaded on Factor I voiced their satisfaction about the\npeer tutoring experiences. Sometimes, fear interfered with their ability\nto ask for clarification from teachers because of the probability of being\ntold \u201cyou should know that already\u201d (NPI15JB2), or that a wrong\n\nimpression would be given to the teachers. However, baccalaureate\nstudents felt it more accessible to externalize their thoughts and make\nexplicit their questions related to the subjects from interaction with\npeer tutors. Peer tutoring may result in information being more readily\naccepted by students as individuals often turn to others who have a\nsimilar experience, for advice and guidance (Stone et al., 2013).\n\nTopping (2005) reported that peer tutoring could naturally be both\nformal and informal, whereas those in Factor I said that students' in-\nteractions with peer tutors were mainly formal. Participants said most\nof their collaborations were limited within the class, their contact with\nthe peer tutors was insufficient and \u201cpeer tutors were not the preferred\npoint of contact when facing difficulties.\u201d\n\n4.2. Factor II: \u201cSafety Net\u201d Supportive Environment\n\nThe Factor II group highlighted the chance for collaborative\nlearning with different master students in peer tutoring. The number of\nstudents reported through peer tutoring opportunity, their circle of\nfriends has been expanded, and the friendships developed during the\npeer tutoring created a network that connected them as a community of\nstudents. Students in Factor II expressed only fellow students under-\nstand, so their networking was developed to help each other process\ninformation and to gain support. Roberts (2009) found that\nthe\nfriendships formed by peer tutors and tutees, which is not only allowing\nthe asking of questions but also abound resources of support. It seems\nthat peers are considered to have a more powerful influence than an\nadvisor or instructor in undergraduate education (Nisbet et al., 2014).\nWhen the students are unsure of what to do or feel uncertainty about\nsomething, they will actively seek out another student. The close in-\nteractions between tutor and tutee can facilitate group discussion that\nmay not quickly happen in a formal teaching atmosphere (Abedini\net al., 2013).\n\nThe students loading on Factor II group did report that the support\nnetworks fostered their sense of belonging and incorporation into the\nspecialty (Item 51, + 2). Unlike the Factor I group, informal commu-\nnication frequently occurred among the students in the Factor II group.\nTutees asked many questions about master students' prior experience.\nHowever, some students pointed out that the after class informal\ncommunications were not in sufficient quantity to satisfy the demand\nfor\nstudents' heavy course tasks\n(NPI332YB).\n\nthe baccalaureate and master\n\nA similar finding is reported by Loke and Chow (2007). In their\nstudy, students described that to arrange a time that was convenient for\nboth tutor and tutee was difficult for they always have another ar-\nrangement. Networking effectiveness is influenced by the quality of the\ntutor-tutee relationship. Relationship building requires time. McKenna\nand French (2011) pointed out that the network built in peer tutoring\ntook place within a reciprocal power relationship. The master students'\nunderstanding of the peer tutor role and their abilities to communicate,\nlisten and share power influence the creation and maintenance of a\nsupportive, inclusive and egalitarian environment where baccalaureate\nstudents are confirmed as not only learners but friends (Watts, 2011),\nwhich may explain why baccalaureate students desire more peer tu-\ntoring opportunities.\n\n4.3. Factor III: \u201cMentoring\u201d Learn How to Learn\n\nIn this group, the focus is on the peer tutors' roles of facilitation of\nhow to learn. In Factor III students' eyes, master students represented\nthose students who were successful in learning and peer tutoring is a\nform of mentoring which promotes the sustainability of the educational\nexperience. The peer tutors' ways of study served as a model for\nlearning processes and strategies. Factor III students portray the ten-\ndency of metacognition such as enhanced self-motivation and respon-\nsibility for their learning. They described that in the simulation la-\nboratory, some of the master students helped them turn theory into\n\n239\n\n\fT. Li et al.\n\nNurse Education Today 61 (2018) 235\u2013241\n\npractice by illustrating relevant concepts from a clinical practice with\ncare for a patient with a similar disease process. During the course, peer\ntutors acted as the standard patients and attending the debriefing. Peer\ntutors gave immediate feedback about the students' clinical perfor-\nmances especially in the patients' role, and provided advises on how\nthey would behave under such circumstances. Students reported per-\nsonal growth, such as increased self-confidence. Also, perceived an in-\ncrease in patient care competence and motivation because actively\nparticipate during the entire session.\n\nKing et al. (1998) stressed the promotion of metacognition termed\nas the capability to reflect on, understand, control, and reconstruct\none's cognitive processes and strategies in academic tasks (Efklides,\n2008). This kind of ability requires students to step back and to consider\nthe cognitive learning process, it is relatively stable but late-developing\n(Backer et al., 2012). A study conducted by Rush et al. (2012) explored\nthe possibility of peer tutoring, as a particular kind of collaborative\nlearning, to promote university students' metacognition. Reports in-\ndicated that peer tutors could effectively model study skills by func-\ntioning as role models for baccalaureate students (Ramm et al., 2015;\nHarvey et al., 2010). Peer tutoring was welcomed by most students in\nFactor III group for the potential of modeling learning behaviors in the\nsimulation laboratory (Item 56, +5; Item 9, + 5), but some bacca-\nlaureate students complained that few peer tutors showed less respon-\nsibility for the tutors' roles (NPI19LA1). Some participants attributed\nmore value to the feedback provided by the qualified staff rather than\nthe peer tutors. In the interview, some of them expressed the view that\nthe peer tutors were not well prepared for the scenarios or could not\nanswer their questions straight away (NPI315YA).\n\nSimilar findings were reported by recent studies (Christiansen et al.,\n2011; Loke and Chow, 2007). Nisbet et al. (2014) pointed out that the\nnegative feedback might attribute to some peer tutors were not adept at\na tutor role. The interaction and relational support need to be en-\ngendered in the peer tutoring may be taxing in the aspect of the task\nand role responsibility. The pressure generated from time and admin-\nistration might indirectly affect the quality of tutorial support (Watts,\n2011). The tutees' growth will also challenge the tutor (Christiansen\net al., 2011).\n\n4.4. Strengths and Limitations\n\nThere are several strengths of this study. Factors and an under-\nstanding of Chinese baccalaureate nursing students' perceptions toward\npeer tutoring in the simulation laboratory were successfully identified\nand explored by using Q-methodology. This study is valuable because it\nis important to understand the nursing students' present perceptions\ntoward peer tutoring in simulation laboratory with the intention of\neffectively applying them in undergraduate nursing education. Despite\nthe benefits of this research, several limitations should be considered.\nFirstly, this study used participants from a single university; the find-\nings might not be broadly applied to universities with different levels.\nSecondly, Q methodology explores subjective experience and cannot be\nused to generalize beyond the study, but the study has provided some\nuseful insights into the value that students place on peer mentoring in a\nsimulation environment. Thirdly, the ability of the peer tutors impacts\nthe quality of the methodology. Therefore,\nif peer tutors are un-\nqualified, the outcomes will be influenced.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe predominant feature of this study is that it was one of the first to\nutilize Q methodology to reveal Chinese baccalaureate nursing students'\nperspectives of peer tutoring in the simulation laboratory. The results\nsupport that peer tutoring is a useful supplement for simulation. Peer\ntutoring contributes to knowledge acquisition through sharing the si-\nmilar learning experiences and empowers the baccalaureate students to\nparticipate in the learning process actively. Peer tutoring fosters both\n\nformal and informal communication, providing students a supportive\nsafety net. Through serving as models, peer tutors also \u201cmentor\u201d un-\ndergraduates' teaching how to learn and helped them translate simu-\nlation with clinical reality, implementing theory into practice. All the\nactions mentioned help undergraduates to adapt to the simulation as\nsoon as possible, decrease their anxiety and relieve their cognitive\nburnout. Though students acknowledge the peer tutoring's benefits,\nthere are some negative comments about it. Furthermore, all the par-\nticipants in this study had only one-semester experience of peer tu-\ntoring. The time was short, but the influences of peer tutoring were\nexposed adequately. Future research should be conducted to expand the\neffects of peer tutoring in the simulation laboratory and the bacca-\nlaureate students' perspectives.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nDesign: TL, MP.\nResearch supervision: MP.\nData collection: TL.\nData analysis: TL, MP.\nManuscript writing: TL.\nCritical revision and intellectual content: MP, TES.\n\nReferences\n\nAbedini, M., Mortazavi, F., Javadinia, S.A., Moonaghi, H.K., 2013.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION   The present invention relates to a novel drug delivery tech  nology. More particularly the invention relates to a method of  delivering at least one therapeutic compound or a formulation  comprising the at least one therapeutic compound to a patient;  to a throwaway or reusable device for delivering at least one  therapeutic compound or a formulation comprising the at  least one therapeutic compound to a patient in a manner as set  out by the method; to a pioneer projectile for use in said  method; to formulations for use in said method and to an  injectate comprising a pioneer projectile and formulation. It  also relates to a disposable component containing either a  pioneer projectile or an injectate. The present invention also  relates to a throwaway or reusable device for delivering at  least one therapeutic compound, or a formulation comprising  the at least one therapeutic compound (hereafter drug) to a  patient, and a method for administering a drug to a patient  using said device. It also relates to a packaged drug for use  with said device.   5   10   15   25   30   BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION   35   One route of administration for therapeutic compounds is  through the skin. The skin is also one of the more efficient  routes for delivery of a therapeutic compound when com  pared to other standard delivery routes such as oral or pulmo  nary delivery.   Administration to the skin is most commonly undertaken  using a needle and Syringe as a delivery system with the  therapeutic compound in a liquid form.   Sucha system has a number of associated problems includ  ing the pain and fear associated with needles, the fact they are  really best Suited to injecting liquids which are not necessar  ily the best way of delivering compounds to a patient and the  fact that sharps are left which create a disposal problem.   Drug delivery systems that do not incorporate needles are  also used for injecting liquids through the skin and this is  achieved by the delivery system creating a very fine, high  Velocity liquid jet that creates its own hole through the skin.  There are however a number of problems with such a method  including splashback.   With both these forms of liquid delivery relatively large  Volumes of liquid are injected which, because they are incom  pressible, have to tear the tissue apart in order to be accom  modated.   However, drug injection through the skin does not have to  be achieved with the drug in a standard liquid form. Solid  form drugs have been successfully administered with the  PowderJect system, which uses a compressed gas source to  accelerate powdered drugs to a Velocity at which they can  penetrate the outer layers of the skin. This system typically  employs powdered drug particles of less than 100 microns in  diameter, which require a velocity of several hundred meters   40   45   50   55   60   65   2  per second in order to penetrate human tissue. However the  system has its  own inherent problems such as controlled  delivery.   It has also been shown in the past that solid rods or splinters  of a therapeutic compound can be pushed, at a relatively low  velocity, into the skin without the requirement for a needle  although more traditionally these are delivered as implants.  The current transdermal drug delivery techniques can thus  be categorised into groups based on the drug form and the  velocity of the injection as set out in table 1 below:   TABLE 1   Drug Form   Solid   Drug Injection Velocity   Liquid   High Velocity   Low Velocity   Liquid Jet Injector   PowderJect Systems  Drug darts   Needle and Syringe  Drug Splinters'   Drug darts are disclosed in a number of publications. WO  96/40351 (American Cyanamid) discloses an implant dart  with a head of a solid plastics material which takes the form  of a blade and a tubular body that contains one or more  Sustained release drug delivery implant packages. Flexible  stabilizing wings are provided on either side of the dart head  which serve as a lock or barb to prevent the dart being pulled  out after entry. The dart has on outside diameter of about 7  mm and a length of about 45 mm and is delivered with an  injection gun which fires the dart into an animal, but not a  human, when a trigger is released. The propulsion mecha  nism delivers a force sufficient to impart a high accelerating  velocity of from 40-60 mph on the dart. To inject the dart at  low speed it is necessary to make a small incision in the  animal and operate the push bar manually.   U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,948,263 and 4,326,524 also disclose bal  listic delivery devices. U.S. Pat. No. 3,948.263 discloses a  ballistic implant which is fired from a 0.25 calibre rifle. The  projectile exits at about 900 ft/sec and can travel 20-40 ft  before implanting into muscle Some 1-2 inches beneath the  skin. U.S. Pat. No.4,326,524 discloses a solid dose ballistic  projectile formed entirely of a cohesive mixture comprising  biologically active material, in the form of grindable solid  particles and a binder which is capable of withstanding the  stresses imparted on impact. The projectile has a body portion  with a diameter of from 4.5 to 7.6 mm, with a conical nose  portion with a base diameter smaller than the diameter of the  body such that a slight shoulder region is formed between the  body and the nose. The end remote from the nose is preferably  concave to aid flight.   GB2365100 is another example of a remote ballistic deliv  ery device which is fired and attains velocities of greater than  500m/s. In contrast to those described above the device is  slowed on impact so that it does not enter the body but instead  the device's nose is moved back such that a needle enters the  body, and a drug is injected. Such a device is not needleless.  CA1019638 discloses a projectile which is launched by a  conventional air gun or bow. It comprises a head piece and a  shaft, the head piece pierces the animals flesh and the shaft  breaks away. In one embodiment the head piece is made of a  porous material which retains a liquid drug through capillary  action through launch and impact and which releases it by  diffusion when it  is  inserted into the animal. In a second  embodiment the head piece takes the form of a hardened cake.  To aid penetration a metal or plastics tip may be provided. The  drug delivering element remaining in the skin is about 3 mm  diameter by 13 mm in length.   \fUS 8,574,188 B2   3  U.S. Pat. No. 3,901,158 Ferb discloses a hypodermic pro  jectile which is again fired from a rifle or pistol. It comprises  a shatterable front end of plastic or glass which breaks on  impact releasing the liquid contents.   None of the described high velocity  devices bear any  resemblance to the present invention in which the at least one  therapeutic compound or a formulation comprising the at  least one therapeutic compound is pushed at low velocity  from a device which contacts the skin and in which the pio  neer projectile is water soluble, lipid soluble or otherwise  biodegradable in the human or animal and is  furthermore  significantly Smaller having a width or diameter of less than 3  mm in width, more preferably still less than 2.5 mm through  2 mm and 1.5 mm to about 1 mm in width; a height of less than  10 mm in height, more preferably about 1.5 to 2 mm in height  and an aspect ratio of less than 1:8, preferably less than 1:6,  more preferably less than 1:4, more preferably still less than  1:3, and most preferably about 1:1.5.  High velocity liquid systems are exemplified by U.S. Pat.  No. 116,313 McGregor. Liquid is first ejected from a small  orifice in a probe at a very high Velocity and pressure which  will penetrate the skin and then the main charge of liquid is  ejected at a lower velocity into the channel formed by the  initial penetration.   EP0139286 (Sumitomo Chemical Co Limited) discloses  Sustained-release preparations in the form of needle like or  bar like shapes, which comprise an active ingredient and a  pharmaceutically acceptable biodegradable carrier. The Sus  tained-release preparation can be administered to the body by  injection by pushing it through a hollow needle or by implan  tation.   WO 94/22423  (Bukh Meditec AIS) discloses  a  drug  administration system. The method of parenteral administra  tion comprises administering a drug Substance by penetrating  the skin or the mucosa of a human oran animal by a body with  an appropriately formed Solid pharmaceutical composition.  The body of the pharmaceutical composition may be needle  shaped so as to avoid external penetration equipment. The  Solid pharmaceutical composition comprises at least one drug  Substance and has a shape and/or strength to enable penetra  tion. The composition is made by mixing a material, prefer  ably a polymer and optionally a filler with an active drug  Substance; extruding the mixture to form an elongate body;  drying it and forming a pointed end.   U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,542,920, 6,117,443 and 6,120,786 (Cherif  Cheikh)  all  disclose  needle-less  parenteral  introduction  devices. A medicament is made in the form of a solid needle  having a pointed end that has sufficient structural integrity to  penetrate the skin. The needles are less than 2 mm, preferably  0.2 to 0.8 mm, in diameter and 10 to 30 mm in length.  U.S. Pat. No. 6,102,896 (Roser) is primarily directed to a  disposable injector device for injecting controlled release  water Soluble glass needles. It however also recognises that  these glass needles, which are about 1 mm in diameter by 10  mm in length and contain a medicament may also be used as  pioneer projectiles to  produce a low resistance pathway  through the tissue along which a liquid Suspension (exempli  fied as a drug in a suspension of PFC fluid) can flow. This  document appears the first and only document to recognise  that a dissolvable pioneer projectile may be used to enable the  introduction of a medicament. It however fails to recognise  that it may be used as a general technique for introducing  medicaments in other forms. Indeed this is readily apparent  from the document in which a dry powdered formulation is  made into a non viscous liquid by Suspending it in PFC.   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   The present invention takes the concept of using a pioneer  projection (as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,102.896) further   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   4  and follows from the applicants recognition that a pioneer  projectile can be used as a means for introducing medica  ments in forms other than a free flowing, non viscous liquid.  According to a first aspect of the present invention there is  provided a method of delivering at least one therapeutic com  pound or a formulation containing the at least one therapeutic  compound to a human or animal in the form of a needleless  injection comprising:   i) Penetrating the skin with a water soluble, lipid soluble or  otherwise biodegradable pioneer projectile having a  diameter of less than 3 mm which is left in the human or  animal; and   ii) Introducing directly, or substantially directly, behind the  pioneer projectile, the at least one therapeutic compound  or the formulation containing the at least one therapeutic  compound, which at least one therapeutic compound or  the formulation containing the at least one therapeutic  compound is provided and delivered in a contained State.   By contained State is meant either:  i) As a liquid contained by a membrane;  ii) As a liquid with a viscosity of at least 5000 centipoises  (the  Viscosity  of honey),  more particularly  at  least  50,000 (the consistency of mayonnaise) and most pref  erably still at least 100,000 (the consistency of peanut  butter), Such that the liquid has characteristics more akin  to a solid than a liquid i.e. they have a definite shape as  well as volume (and are not readily free flowing);  iii) As a semi-solid (having a viscosity and rigidity inter   mediate that of a Solid or a liquid);   iv) As a paste (having a soft malleable consistency);  V) As a gel (a liquid dispersed in a solid) which materials  can all be considered to have a degree of stiffness; or  vi) As a solid (a state in which the matter retains its own  shape).   Introducing a medicament in Such a contained State has  advantages in that splash back and seepage can be avoided  and more controlled dosages delivered when compared to a  following non Viscous liquid formulation. The viscous, semi  Solid or Solid nature of the medicament ensures that the pio  neer projectile is pushed to the requisite depth and is followed  by the medicament rather than seeping around the sides of the  projectile. The semi Solid formulations, gels, pastes and sol  ids are also generally more stable than liquid formulations  and are more patient compliable.   Furthermore it will be appreciated that by introducing the  medicament in a form other than as a non viscous liquid  behind a pioneer projectile it is possible to tailor the charac  teristics of the medicament for optimum pharmacokinetic  delivery rather than for penetration.   Similarly the pioneer projectile can be developed to have  optimised penetrating capabilities independent of the medi  Cament.   Preferably the pioneer projectile is independent of the at  least one therapeutic compound or the formulation containing  the at least one therapeutic compound.   Alternatively the pioneer projectile is independent of yet  forms an integral part of the at least one therapeutic com  pound or the formulation containing the at least one thera  peutic compound.   Most preferably the pioneer projectile forms a head to the  at least one therapeutic compound or the formulation contain  ing the at least one therapeutic compound.   The at least one therapeutic compound or the formulation  containing the at least one therapeutic compound can take a  number of forms.   In one embodiment the at least one therapeutic compound  or the formulation containing the at least one therapeutic   \fUS 8,574,188 B2   5  compound is  a liquid contained in a water soluble, lipid  soluble or otherwise biodegradable membrane.   In another embodiment the at least one therapeutic com  pound or the formulation containing the at least one thera  peutic compound is provided in a solid form Such as, for  example, crystals, particles, granules, beads, rods, discs or a  combination thereof.   In yet another embodiment the at least one therapeutic  compound or the formulation containing the at least one  therapeutic compound is provided as a viscous liquid, semi  Solid, gel or paste which may be further Supported, if desir  able, by a water soluble lipid soluble or otherwise biodegrad  able membrane.   In the method of the invention the skin is penetrated and the  therapeutic compound administered at a low velocity. By low  velocity is meant less than 100 m/s. Preferably the velocity is  less than 10 m/s, more preferably still less than 5 m/s and most  preferably in the order of a few m/s.   Since the injectate is pushed at a low velocity rather than  fired at a high Velocity it is possible to ensure that the dosage  is always delivered to the correct (and same) depth under the  skin. This means that the system can be used on different skin  types and skin locations and the dosage will still be delivered  to the same depth.   According to a second aspect of the invention there is  provided a method of facilitating the delivery of at least one  therapeutic compound or a formulation containing the at least  one therapeutic compound to a human or animal as a needle  less injection comprising:   i) Providing a water soluble, lipid soluble or otherwise  biodegradable pioneer projectile having a diameter of  less than 3 mm capable of penetrating the human or  animals skin; and   ii) Providing directly, or substantially directly, behind the  pioneer projectile, the at least one therapeutic compound  or the formulation containing the at least one therapeutic  compound in a contained State.   The act of pushing the at least one therapeutic compound in  the contained State causes the pioneer projectile to penetrate  the human or animals skin and the therapeutic compound or  the formulation containing the at least one therapeutic com  pound follows the pioneer projectile and is introduced into the  human or animal in the contained state.   The invention also extends to novel pioneer projectiles.  According to a third aspect of the present invention there is  provided a water soluble, lipid soluble or otherwise biode  gradable pioneer projectile having a diameter of less than 3  mm, and which is capable of penetrating the skin of a human  or animal to thereby facilitate the injection of at least one  following therapeutic compound or therapeutic compound  containing formulation in a contained State, comprising:   i) A first \u201cpenetrating  face which in use penetrates the   human or animals skin; and   ii) Remote from the first face a second \u201cdriven  face which  in the course of injection is the face upon which a driving  force is exerted through the contained therapeutic com  pound ortherapeutic compound containing formulation;  characterised in that said pioneer projectile has an aspect  ratio (width to height) of less than 1:10.   Because the pioneer projectile has been developed sepa  rately of the medication it has been possible to reduce its size  from one of at least 10 mm in length to about a few millime  ters. It has also been possible to optimise its shape Such that it  functions as a leading head or tip for a following contained  formulation, the two components forming an injectate.   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   6  Preferably the pioneer projectile has an aspect ratio of less  than 1:8, preferably less than 1:6, more preferably less than  1:4, more preferably still less than 1:3, and most preferably  about 1:1.5.   Preferably the pioneer projectile is less than 3 mm in width,  more preferably still less than 2.5 mm, through 2 mm and 1.5  mm, to about 1 mm in width.   Preferably the pioneer is less than 10 mm in height, more  preferably about 1.5 to 2 mm in height. By reducing the height  to a minimum it is possible to maximise the amount of thera  peutic compound being injected. In this regard it should be  noted that if the combined pioneer projectile and following  drug formulation is too longit might not be possible to deliver  the drug to the optimum depth.   In one embodiment the pioneer projectile is free of any  therapeutic compound. In another embodiment it comprises  at least one therapeutic compound. Thus, for example it might  be beneficial to include, for example, an antibiotic in the  pioneer projectile or have it release atherapeutic compoundat  a different rate to the formulation in, for example, the case of  insulin injections.   The skin penetrating face of the pioneer projectile prefer  ably comprises a cutting element to facilitate entry. This may  take the form of a sharp point or an oblique edge. Alterna  tively the skin penetrating face may be blunt or gently curved.  In one embodiment the face for contacting the therapeutic  compound or therapeutic compound containing formulation  in a contained state is flat. Alternatively it may be concave or  otherwise hollowed to  facilitate pushing and formulation  containment.   The pioneer projectile may be made of any suitable mate  rial. Suitable materials are those hard and rigid enough to  facilitate penetration at low velocities. Preferred materials  include glassy materials e.g. the Sugarglasses as noted in WO  98/41188 which materials are included herein by reference.  The term \"sugar  thus covers not only disaccharide Sugars,  Such as, trehalose, but also monosaccharide Sugars and their  non reducing derivatives, such as, Sugar alcohols including:  mannitol, inositol, xylitol, ribitol and the like, which form a  general class of stabilising glass-forming Sugars and Sugar  derivatives. The term \"sugar glass\u201d is to be understood as  covering not only glasses which are readily and rapidly dis  Solved in an aqueous environment. Such as, trehalose but also  Sugar glasses in which the Sugar molecule has been modified  by the attachment of one or more hydrophobic side chains to  make the glass more slowly soluble in bodily fluids than the  native Sugar in order to give controlled release characteristics.  In some circumstances the pioneer projectile may com  prise a barrier material over at least the face that contacts the  therapeutic compound in a contained State or vice versa Such  that  the  respective components will  not  react  with one  another.   The invention also extends to novel formulations.  According to a fourth aspect of the present invention there  is provided atherapeutic compound ortherapeutic compound  containing formulation which is held in a contained state and  adapted for introduction into a human oranimal in the form of  a needleless injection behind a water soluble, lipid soluble or  otherwise biodegradable pioneer projectile having a diameter  of less than 3 mm.   Preferably the formulation comprises less than 50 mg of  therapeutic compound in a volume of less than 50mm, more  preferably less than 10 mg of therapeutic compound in a  volume of less than 10 mm.   \fUS 8,574,188 B2   7  The therapeutic compound or therapeutic compound con  taining formulation may be provided as a liquid contained in  water soluble, lipid soluble or otherwise biodegradable mem  brane.   In an alternative embodiment the therapeutic compound or  therapeutic compound containing formulation is provided in  a solid form comprising for example crystals, particles, gran  ules, beads, rods, discs or a combination thereof which are  generally likely to be more stable than traditional non-viscous  liquid formulations with a viscosity similar to that of water  e.g. 1 Centipoise or glucose e.g. 500 Centipoises.   In a preferred embodiment the therapeutic compound or  therapeutic compound containing formulation is provided as  a semi Solid, gel or paste. In this form it is particularly patient  compliant and the therapeutic compound is generally likely to  be more stable than if it were in a traditional non-viscous  liquid formulation.   Where the therapeutic compound ortherapeutic compound  containing formulation is a viscous liquid, it preferably has a  viscosity of at least 10,000 Centipoises more preferably at  least 50,000 Centipoises and more preferably still at least  100,000 Centipoises.   The formulation may comprise an end piece beyond the  therapeutic compound ortherapeutic compound which is free  of the \u201cactive' being injected thus ensuring that the entire  therapeutic compound enters the patient in a unit dose rather  than risk under or over dosing.   The therapeutic compound or therapeutic compound con  taining formulation may comprise a plurality of differently  formulated elements.   The therapeutic compound or therapeutic compound con  taining formulation may be packaged in a cap, cartridge,  carousel or cassette.   The invention also extends to an injectate comprising a  pioneer projectile and a therapeutic compound or therapeutic  compound containing formulation.   According to a fifth aspect of the present invention there is   provided a needleless injectate for injection comprising:   a) A water soluble, lipid soluble or otherwise biodegrad  able pioneer projectile having a diameter of less than 3  mm, and   b) A therapeutic compound or therapeutic compound con  taining formulation which is held in a contained state  behind the pioneer projectile.   These components are as previously described.  The pioneer projectile and therapeutic compound or thera  peutic compound containing formulation may both be water  soluble, lipid soluble or otherwise biodegradable to differing  degrees.   A barrier may be provided between the pioneer projectile  and the therapeutic compound or therapeutic compound con  taining formulation.   The injectate may be contained/packaged in a cap, car  tridge, carousel or cassette optionally together with a means,  e.g. an ejector pin, for pushing the injectate out of its con  tainer.   Alternatively the pioneer projectile and the therapeutic  compound or therapeutic compound containing formulation  are contained/packaged in separate caps, cartridges, carou  sels or cassettes.   The invention also extends to a device for injecting a pio  neer projectile and a therapeutic compound or therapeutic  compound containing formulation.   According to a sixth aspect of the present invention there is  provided a needleless  device (60) for injecting a water  soluble, lipid soluble or otherwise biodegradable pioneer pro  jectile (10) having a diameter of less than 3 mm and at least   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   8  one contained therapeutic compound or therapeutic com  pound containing formulation (42) into a human or animal  body, said device comprises a housing (62) containing a  mechanism (92) capable of generating a force which will  cause a striker (84) to travel along a striker guide (86), said  housing having an end face (100) which is in operative com  munication with a component (72) comprising a casing (74)  having an aperture (76) in which is mounted an ejector pin  (78) and, therebelow, an injectate (40) comprising a pioneer  projectile (10) and a formulation (42) such that in use the  striker will contact the ejector pin and the injectate will be  pushed out of the casing as a single unit into the human or  animal body.   The reference numerals given above are non-limiting but  have been included solely for the purpose of assisting the  reader.   The term ejector pin is intented to covera pin, piston, rod or  like member which functions to push the injectate from the  aperture.   The power source for initiating or assisting the pushing  may be a mechanical spring in the form of for example, a  coiled spring or a lever spring. Alternatively, a gas spring  might be used or even an electrically powered system. A  mechanical spring would allow reuse of the delivery system  although this would mean the user has to recharge the spring  between administrations. Alternatively, the spring (mechani  cal orgas) could be pre-charged during manufacture so that it  can only be used once and then the whole system would be  thrown away. In a reusable device there will be a throw away  component containing the pioneer projectile or the pioneer  projectile and the therapeutic compound or therapeutic com  pound containing formulation.   The device preferably incorporates a safety mechanism to  avoid accidental actuation. Actuation might be triggered with  a push button on the device but preferably would be under  taken by pushing the device against the skin thus ensuring  good contact with the skin on actuation.   In a reusable device the reusable component and the throw  away component comprise means by which they are con  nected to one another.   The device may be adapted to inject multiple doses either  sequentially  or simultaneously.  In  one embodiment the  device comprises a cartridge, carousel or cassette containing  a plurality of pioneer projectiles or a plurality of injectates  comprising a pioneer projectile and a therapeutic compound  or therapeutic compound containing formulation.   In another embodiment the device comprises a cap con  taining a single pioneer projectile and a single unit dose of the  therapeutic compound or therapeutic compound containing  formulation.   The various aspects described above give rise to a system  having a number of advantages over the prior art delivery  methods and some of these are noted in table 2 below:   TABLE 2   Benefit   Justification   1  Can use   60   formulations with  Increased Product  Stability.   2  Improved Product   Storage   65   Many drugs are more stable in Solid form  than in a liquid state. A viscous liquid  formulation would be more akin to a solid  drug in terms of its stability characteristics  because of the excipients that can be used  The increased stability with some  compounds may allow storage of the final  delivery system at room temperature rather  than requiring refrigeration   \fUS 8,574,188 B2   9  TABLE 2-continued   Benefit   Justification   Reduced Risk Of  Cross Infection  Small Device Size   Cheap Device   6  Reusable Device   7  Variable Power   System   8  Small Skin  Response  9  Quiet Device   10  Easy to Understand  Delivery System   11  Variable Dose   12  Self Injection   13  Controlled Depth  Of Penetration  Of The Delivered  Dose  14  Large Doses  Achievable   Without the need for needles there is a  reduced risk of blood borne diseases  Spring, trigger, injectate and piston are the  main components required  A spring is a cheap power source. Small  overall number of device components  The design can allow for the spring to  be primed for reuse. Disposable components  would be small in terms of size and cost  but would include the component holding  the injectate or pioneer projectile  A spring-powered device could allow the  tension on the spring to be altered for  different skin types and skin positions  on the body, if necessary.  As experienced with splinters   Actuation of a spring powered delivery  system will be quiet  Easy to comprehend the forces involved  in pushing a foreign body into the skin to  a known depth. Easy to measure the  physical characteristics required for a  dose of injectate of this size  With a viscous injectate it will be possible  to alter the dose injected  With a simple system patients can inject  themselves, thus reducing healthcare costs  Pushing the injectate into the skin rather  than firing it enables a consistent and  controlled depth of penetration in the skin   Large doses of one or more drugs are  achievable by having one or more doses  of injectate administered in the same  injection   The concept behind the invention allows for a simple  needleless drug delivery device that pushes a drug in a \"con  tained' state.   A semi solid, paste or gel is the preferred form since unlike  a non-viscous liquid it would follow the pioneer projectile. (A  non-viscous liquid can \u201csplash back  and more easily seep  around the track formed by the pioneer projectile.) Its stiff  ness relative to a non-viscous liquid also means it is easier to  push than a non-viscous liquid material. The more solid in  nature the better this is. However from a comfort perspective  a semi Solid or paste or gel is  more likely to be patient  compliant and dissolve more readily in the body.   The delivery device for delivering such an injectate (pio  neer projectile and formulation) could take a number of forms  and several such devices are described by way of example.  A first device described is a spring-powered device with the  Spring, triggering the pushing of a pin. The pin then engages  the injectate to push it into the skin with the pin being stopped  by either an end stop within the device or by coming into  contact with the skin, preferably over a relatively wide area  (compared to the injectate) to reduce the force felt on the skin.  If the device is to be reusable then the component holding  the injectate might be detached from the rest of the device and  thrown away and a new disposable component attached  before the next injection. The injection itself would occur in  a matter of milliseconds after actuation and would seem  instantaneous as far as the user is concerned. Alternatively the  formulation might be injected from, for example, a tube and  a new pioneer projectile would be required for a further injec  tion.   By way of a further development the needleless device  described with reference to the sixth aspect of the invention  was further developed with the aim of producing a simple,   10  cheap drug delivery device which is adaptable and able to  deliver a drug in the form of not only a needleless injectate but  also other forms, such as, for example liquid formulations,  and solid drug needles.   This aim is achieved by the provision of a device which is  adapted to receive a packaged drug which is slidably mounted  in the device such that in use the device is able to push the drug  from its packaging, the packaged drug being packaged Such  that the drug, whatever its form, can be pushed from its  packaging by the device.   It is another and independent aim to package different drug   forms for use with such a device.   This aim is achieved by the provision of a packaging  adapted to be attached to the device and which comprises a  channel housing the drug, and a drive pin or like element for  pushing it out when actuated by the device.   There are many possible product applications for Such a  delivery device and they include therapeutic, prophylactic  and diagnostic applications. Applications may be limited to  those drugs that are administered in relatively low doses  because of the dose limitations for each injection imposed by  pushing. However, although each dose may be limited to less  than 10 mg or a volume of less than 10 mm it would be  possible to administer more than one dose either concurrently  or sequentially, if larger doses are required.   New laws in many states in the USA are declaring that  safety needles must be used for injections whenever possible.  These are needles that withdraw into a sheath as the needle is  withdrawn from the patient so that the needle tip is not left  exposed. This is to avoid the use of a conventional needle  which can result in accidental needle Stick injuries. A delivery  system that either does not require a needle (or that incorpo  rates a needle that retracts) would be beneficial for the US  market as well as other parts of the world that will, no doubt,  follow the lead of the Americans.   Particular applications where the technology might be very   well suited include:   Vaccines:-  Vaccinations are one of the common reasons  for people to need an injection and many people would rather  risk catching a disease than have to be injected with a standard  needle and Syringe. Children in particular can often have a  needle phobia. Therefore a system that either does not incor  porate a needle (or the needle is never seen by the patient)  might help compliance with vaccines. In third world coun  tries there is a great need for delivery systems for vaccines  that do not involve needles. An added advantage of the new  delivery system is that using a non liquid dose therapeutic  compound should assist stability of the active compounds and  therefore the cold chain storage requirements for the vaccine  may be avoided.   Acute Emergencies:  The device is very quick and easy to  use and therefore well suited for self administration as well as  administration by an untrained assistant. There are a number  of drugs. Such as glucagon (hypoglycaemia), migraine treat  ments or adrenalin (anaphylactic shock) that are required  when the patient may not be in a suitable condition to under  take the injection themselves. Glucagon and some of the  migraine treatments are normally Supplied as a powder that  have to be made up with the diluent before the injection which  means that they are not suitable for administration by an  untrained assistant. In addition, the patient may, or may not be  in a fit state to make up the drug let alone administer it. The  present device would enable these and similar drugs to be  administered in Solid dosage form.   Diabetes:\u2014Millions of people worldwide have to inject  insulin either daily or several times a day. Most have to use a  needle and Syringe although new delivery systems such as   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   \fUS 8,574,188 B2   11  inhalers and insulin pumps are becoming more popular. The  advantage of the new delivery system is that several different  types of insulin can be administered in a Solid dose form at  one time. This can be done by having two or more short pieces  of different insulin formulations in e.g. a drug cassette. This  5  could allow a short as well as a long acting insulin to be  injected at the same time and thus reduce the requirement for  multiple injections throughout the day.   Although the applications above have been highlighted,  the technology is Suitable for administering many drugs that  10  are required at the dosage levels capable of being delivered by  the system.   According to a seventh aspect of the present invention there   is provided a drug delivery device (210) comprising:  i) a housing (212);  ii) a means (214) for generating a force capable of pushing a  drug (216) from a packaging (218) into a human or animal  body;   iii) a means (220) for transmitting said force to push the drug   (216) from the packaging (218) into the human or animal  20  body; and   iv) a means (238,242b) for triggering the device.   The numbers are again included for illustrative purposes   15   and are not to be construed as limiting.   Such a device can be a reusable device which further com- 25   prises a means (222) for receiving a packaged drug (2100);  and a means (224) for priming the device.   Alternatively the device can be a single use device in which  case the packaged drug (2100) will be an integral part of the  device. Such a device can be provided in a pre primed form  30  which just needs triggering or in a form requiring it to be  primed.   A device according to the invention has a number of advan   tages compared to current needle free devices.   It comprises a small number of components and is there-  35   fore cheap to manufacture and assemble. It is also relatively  Small (currently the same size as a dry marker pen).   In a preferred embodiment of the device, it can only be  actuated by inserting a packaged drug and pushing the skin  tensioning end of the packaged drug against a solid object.  40  The priming and actuation of the device by pushing the end of  the device against the skin ensures that there is a reliable and  consistent contact and tensioning of the skin on delivery of  the drug. Additionally, by setting the device such that the  force required to actuate it is from, for example, 20-30 New- 45  ton the force will be too high for a patient to accidentally  actuate the device withoutpushing it firmly against the body\u2019s  tensioned skin, thereby providing a significant safety feature.  A spring and cap arrangement makes it is possible to adjust  the actuation force by altering the tension on the spring. By 50  screwing the cap further onto the upper barrel the spring is  tensioned and by unscrewing it the force can be reduced.  Alternatively, instead of a coil spring as the main power  Source,  the  device  could incorporate any other type  of  mechanical spring or a gas spring. In an alternative embodi-  55  ment the spring could be pre-tensioned during manufacture to  avoid having to tension the spring during the drug adminis  tration. This would result in a single use device in which case  the packaged drug would most likely be an integral part of the  device.   60   The Velocity of the impact hammer during administration  of the therapeutic agent is less than 20 m/s, more preferably  less than 10 m/s, more preferably still less than 5 m/s and most  preferably in the order of 0.1-2 m/s. The skilled man will  appreciate that the actual speed may vary with the mass of the  65  impact hammer and thus the impact imparted on the delivery  dose. As a consequence the therapeutic agent is delivered by   12  a pushing action from the end of the packaged drug rather  than by a firing action (as would be the case with a bullet  leaving the barrel of a gun).   To ensure that the device actuates automatically when the  correct force is applied the hammer has a shaped shoulder  region which engages a correspondingly shaped surface in a  wall separating the upper and lower barrels. The device will  actuate only when the Substantially frustoconical sections  fully engage. This will be at the same main spring tension  every administration and if the administration is  aborted  before the frustoconical sections engage then the packaged  drug can be removed safely  without leaving the device  primed.   In a preferred embodiment the device can\u2019t be primed until  the packaged drug is attached thereto since it is the packaged  drug that acts against the piston in the device to cause the  spring to be tensioned. This makes the device particularly  safe. It also means it can\u2019t be actuated when not loaded Such  that an operator can't use the device in a belief they are  providing an injection.   In the case of a reusable device a stewing spring returns the  impact hammer into it\u2019s non axially aligned position at the  end of each administration.   Furthermore, because the reusable components of the sys  tem (all components except those of the packaged drug) do  not come into contact with the target tissue for the drug  administration they do need to be sterile.   All components apart from the springs can be moulded  making the device cheap to manufacture and the limited num  ber of parts and their ease of assembly keeps assembling costs  to a minimum.   A range of custom packaged drugs will fit the delivery  device but patients will not be able to easily introduce their  own therapeutic compounds into the drug cassettes (as can be  done with a needle and Syringe).   The device is suitable for both human and veterinary appli   cations.   The device is particularly suitable for self administration of   drugs and requires minimal training.   According to an eighth and related aspect of the invention  there is provided a packaged drug (2100), for use with a drug  delivery device, comprising a packaging (218) containing a  drug (216), said packaging (218)  comprising a housing  (218a, 218b) having a channel (2106) running there through  and in which is disposed a drive pin or other element (2108),  a skin piercing means (2110: 2112), and the drug (216), said  housing (218a, 218b) comprising   i) a region (2102) allowing the packaged drug (2100) to be  slidably mounted to the drug delivery device (210); and  ii) an end (2104) adapted to engage and tension the skin.  In the case of a drug splinter the skin piercing means and   the drug may be one of the same.   Preferably the drug is disposed between the drive pin and   the skin piercing means.   Preferably the packaged drug takes the form of a dispos  able end cap, cartridge, cassette or carousel, containing a  single or multiple doses of the drug.   Preferably the region for engaging the packaged drug to the  drug delivery device in a slidable manner additionally com  prises a means for positively locking it to the device Such that  it can still slide within the device but will not fall out under  gravity. Such a means might be a sprung pin or spigot which  exerts a frictional force against the device or a mechanism  whereby the packaged drug is inserted in a particular orien  tation and turned so that it is precluded from being removed  unless it is turned back into the position in which it  was  allowed to enter.   \fUS 8,574,188 B2   13  In a first embodiment the packaged drug houses either a  pioneer projectile in combination with a drug in a contained  state, more preferably a solid, or a drug splinter (a single Solid  entity).   In a second embodiment the piercing means comprises a  needle with two sharp ends, one for puncturing the skin and  the other for puncturing a membrane of a receptacle contain  ing the drug, the drug being released into the needle from  where it drains out into the body through the needle. The drug  is preferably a liquid and is contained in the receptacle which  is  disposed in the channel. Advantageous features of the  device include a spacer between the membrane piercing end  of the needle and the membrane of the drug containing recep  tacle to prevent the needle coming into contact with the mem  brane prior to actuation. The spacer is either resilient or com  pressible and may be Supported by a plate attached to the  needle. The receptacle is preferably sealed by the drive pin or  other like element.   In a third embodiment the packaged drug may contain a  drug in any state (e.g. solid, semi solid or liquid), the actuation  of the device causing, in a two step operation, first the entry of  a pioneer projectile and only then the release of the drug from  a thin walled tube. Release of the drug may optionally require  the breaking of a membrane Supporting the drug in the tube.  In a variation of this embodiment the pioneer projectile,  which is located immediately in front of the thin tube, could  be replaced by a retractable needle tip which is, or is integral  with, the thin walled tube. As per embodiment 1  and 2  described above, the thin walled tube could have a compres  sion spring or other resilient member associated therewith to  withdraw the thin walled tube following the injection.   Aparticularly clever feature of this embodiment is the form  of the drive pin or element which has a plurality of flexible or  frangible arms, in the embodiment illustrated two, extending  from its main body. These arms extendoutwards (splay) when  they ride over a ramped Surface provided on the housing, are  forced away from the body, and ride over a lip on the tube as  a consequence of the flex or frangibility. In consequence the  body of the drive pin or element can move down the tube. This  arrangement facilitates a two step operation whereby in a first  step the drive pin or element acts on the tube causing it to  move and push the pioneer projectile into the skin, and then,  and only when the first step is complete, the arms are caused  to splay and/or Snap thereby allowing the drive pin body to  push the drug contents from the tube. In the case where the  arms are frangible the arms will Snap off as a result of an area  of weakness formed about the shoulder region and fall into a  cavity about the ramped region. A frangible system has two  advantages: firstly it should ensure full injection occurs, and  secondly it will mean the packaged drug can\u2019t be re-used. The  ramp is preferably \"circular  in design, taking the form of a  frustoconical Surface. This has the advantage that it can be  easily moulded and does not require the arms to be orientated  for contact.   Depending on the diameter of the thin walled tube and the  viscosity of the therapeutic compound, the thin walled tube  may need to be sealed, or partially sealed to avoid premature  loss of the drug. However the action of the drive pin body will  be sufficient to break any seal allowing the drug to be released  and pushed into the patient.   An advantage of the packaged drugs exemplified is their  Small cheap Sub-assembly. They are also easy to handle and  place into the device prior to administration. Their size also  facilitates easy storage in, for example, refrigerators.   The packaged drug may be sealed in a foil pouch or the like  to prevent ingress of for example, moisture, oxygen, light,  bacteria or other drug degrading or contaminating agents.   14  In those embodiments having a pioneer projectile the tip  will, in most instances, be positioned a few millimeters from  the end of the drug cassette so that it is moving when it strikes  the target tissue.   Preferably the end adapted to engage and tension the skin  comprises one or more projections about the channel exit,  most preferably in the form of an annular ring, as such an  arrangement most effectively tensions the skin.   A retention system may advantageously be employed to  hold the drug and pioneer projectile in place in the channel.  This might be achieved by, for example, extruding or moul  ding the drug and/orpioneer projectile with a number of small  splines or other features along their outer Surface. These  splines or other features would provide a frictional fit but  would not prohibit the drug from being administered. Alter  natively, the channel of the packaging might have a small  feature, such as, for example, a retaining bump or other pro  jection over which the pioneer projectile and drug have to be  pushed.   A tamperor use evident seal or other indicator means may  additionally be placed over the top end of the packaged drug  so that when e.g. the seal is broken it is obvious that the  packaged drug has not been interfered with and/or is spent.  Additionally or alternatively a seal may be place over the  exit of the channel of the packaged drug. It would be prefer  able to remove this seal prior to administration of the drug but  it would best be designed such that the administration could  be carried out through the seal just in case it wasn\u2019t removed  by the user.   According to yet a further aspect of the invention there is  provided a method of delivering a drug to a human or animal  using a device and/or packaged drug according to the inven  tion.   The various aspects of the invention will now be described,  by way of example only, with reference to the following  Figures and Examples.   10   15   25   30   35   BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS   40   FIG. 1a-e are embodiments of pioneer projectiles of vary   ing shapes and sizes;   hollow driven faces;   45   oblique cutting edge;   FIG. 2a-c are embodiments of pioneer projectiles with   FIG.3a-dare embodiments of pioneer projectiles with an   FIG. 4a-care embodiments of pioneer projectiles with an   oblique cutting edge and hollow driven faces:   FIG.5a-care a plan view, side elevation and end elevation  respectively of a pioneer projectile with an oblique cutting  edge;   FIG. 6a-care a plan view, side elevation and end elevation  respectively of a pioneer projectile with a central piercing  point and faceted sides;   FIG. 7a-care a plan view, side elevation and end elevation  respectively of a pioneer projectile with a central cutting  edge;   FIG. 8a-care a plan view, side elevation and end elevation  respectively of a pioneer projectile with a central piercing  point;   FIG. 9 is one embodiment of an injectate of the invention   shown housed in a Support or device chamber;   FIG. 10 is another embodiment of an injectate of the inven   tion shown housed in a Support or device chamber,   FIG. 11 is another embodiment of an injectate of the inven   tion shown housed in a Support or device chamber,   FIG. 12 is another embodiment of an injectate of the inven   tion shown housed in a Support or device chamber,   50   55   60   65   \fUS 8,574,188 B2   15  FIG. 13 is another embodiment of an injectate of the inven   tion shown housed in a Support or device chamber;   FIG. 14 is another embodiment of an injectate of the inven   tion shown housed in a Support or device chamber;   FIG. 15 is another embodiment of an injectate of the inven   tion shown housed in a Support or device chamber;   FIG. 16 is cross sectional view of a delivery device of the   invention;   FIG. 17 is one embodiment of a reusable device according  to one aspect of the invention with one embodiment of a  packaged drug according to another aspect attached thereto,  the device being shown pre-use:   FIGS.18a, b, and c illustrate a device substantially similar   to the device illustrated in FIG. 17 in:   a) its assembled form  b) at the point where it is fully primed and about to self   10   15   actuate; and   c) in its post actuation position;  FIG. 19 is a packaged drug according to one aspect of the  invention in which the drug is in a Solid or otherwise con  tained form and follows a pioneer projectile;   FIG. 20 is a packaged drug according to another aspect of  the invention in which the drug is in a liquid form and is  released and injected via a retractable needle; and   FIG.21 is a packaged drug according to yet a further aspect  of the invention in which the packaging is adapted to hold a  drug in a solid or liquid form and in which the end of the  packaging is modified to be particularly well adapted to skin  tensioning.   25   16  Of course, the penetrating face 12 need not have a central  point and FIGS. 3a-d, and 4a-c illustrate embodiments in  which the pioneer projectiles have an oblique cutting edge 24.  The shape of the penetrating face can, as noted above, take  a number of forms as exemplified with reference to FIGS.5-8.  In each of these Figsa) is a plan view; b) is a side elevation and  c) is an end elevation. Thus:   In FIG. 5 the pioneer projectile is circular in X-section  (FIG. 5a), has an oblique cutting edge 24 (FIG. 5b), and a  planar penetrating face 12 (FIG. 5c).   In FIG. 6 the pioneer projectile is circular in X-section  (FIG. 6a), has a central point 26 (FIG. 6b), and four facets 28  making up the penetrating face 12 (FIG. 6c).   In FIG. 7 the pioneer projectile is circular in X-section  (FIG. 7a), has a central cutting edge 30 (FIG. 7b), and two  facets 28 making up the penetrating face 12 (FIG. 7c).   In FIG. 8 the pioneer projectile is circular in X-section  (FIG. 8a), has a conical penetrating face (FIG. 8b), culminat  ing in a point 30 and a penetrating face 12 (FIG. 8c).   Of course the pioneer projectile need not be circular in  cross section but could be, for example, three sided (triangu  lar), four sided (square) or indeed any other Suitable shape.  A pioneer projectile might be manufactured in a number of  ways such as by moulding, extrusion or sectioning a rod of the  material.   Preferably the pioneer projectile will dissolve in the tissue  in a matter of minutes or hours depending on the material  used.   The pioneer projectile together with at least one therapeu   DETAILED DESCRIPTION   Referring to the drawings, FIG. 1a is a side elevation of a  pioneer projectile 10 according to one aspect of the present  invention. It is made of a crystalline or amorphous material,  preferably a glassy material, (e.g. a Sugar glass such as treha  lose, palatinit, glucopyranosyl Sorbitol, glucopyranosyl man  nitol, lactitol or monosaccharide alcohols such as mannitol or  inositol) which is water-soluble and dissolves in the body.  The material may include a hardening agent, Such as, for  example, povidone (pvp). The pioneer projectile comprises a  penetrating face 12 comprising one of more facets, which has  a central point, one or more guiding faces 16 for guiding the  pioneer projectile within a central aperture or chamber of a  needleless device for injecting an injectate (comprising the  pioneer projectile and a formulation) thus ensuring the pio  neer projectile meets the skin at a Suitable angle to aid pen  etration, and a driven face 14. The pioneer projectile has an  aspect ratio (width W to height H) of about 1.25:1.   The pioneer projectile can however take a number of forms  and some further embodiments are illustrated in FIG. 1b-d.  FIG.2a-2c, FIG. 3a-d, FIG. 4a-c, FIG.5a-c, FIG. 6a-c; FIG.  7a-C and FIG. 8a-c.   Briefly: FIG. 1b illustrates a pioneer projectile with a very  small aspect ratio of about 1:0.5: FIG. 1c illustrates a pioneer  projectile with an aspect ratio of about 1:2: FIG. 1d illustrates  a pioneer projectile with a blunt and planar penetrating face  12, and an aspect ratio of about 1:0.2; and FIG. 1e illustrates  a pioneer projectile which does not have a guiding face 16 but  consists of a penetrating face 12 and a driven face 14.   FIGS. 2a to 2c illustrate variations in the driven face 14.  Thus in FIG.2a the driven face is completely hollowed form  ing a Void 18 which can hold, at least in part, at least one  therapeutic compound or compound containing formulation.  In FIG.2b the hollow 18 has a flat bottom 20 and in FIG. 2C  it has a concave bottom 22.   30   tic compound or formulation forms an injectate.   The physical characteristics of the formulation are very  important to ensure that the injectate can be administered to  the skin in a reliable and repeatable manner   The formulation could take a number of forms:  In one embodiment it might take the form of a paste. This  can be achieved by mixing the active drug with the appropri  ate excipients to end up with consistency, say, like toothpaste.  The excipients would obviously need to maintain the active  ingredient in a condition Such that it was still active during  manufacture, storage and administration.   In other embodiments the formulation will be a semi solid,   gel, Solid or contained liquid.   The therapeutic component of the formulation might be   present in one or more of the following formats:  1. Pure drug;  2. With excipients to alter the physical characteristic of the   35   40   45   material;   3. With excipients to bulk out the active ingredient;  4. With excipients to buffer the active ingredient;  5. With excipients to change the release profile of the active   50   ingredient; and   6. As a mixture of more than one therapeutic compound.   The formulation can be designed to give the desired release  profile for the application. This might involve either a sus  tained release formulation or a quick dissolving formulation  for immediate release into the body. In some cases, such as for  the administration of insulin, a formulation might be required  that provides an immediate release of some of the therapeutic  compound and thena Sustained release of another component  in the formulation. This might for example be achieved by  having the formulation in a plurality of parts or by incorpo  rating a medicament into the pioneer projectile.   Alternatively the therapeutic compound might be formu  lated as small beads. A number of the beads could be lined up  in the device behind a pioneer projectile. On actuation of the  device the pioneer projectile pierces the skin and the beads are  pushed into the skin behind the pioneer projectile.   55   60   65   \fUS 8,574,188 B2   17  The therapeutic component of the formulation must of  course not react with the material used for the pioneer pro  jectile or the materials used in the delivery system.   FIGS.9 to 15 are some embodiments illustrating injectates   and formulations of the invention.   In FIG. 9 an injectate 40 comprises a pioneer projectile 10  and a formulation 42. The formulation is in a contained State  supported by its own viscosity or a membrane 44. The for  mulation is thus a contained liquid or a solid. The injectate  may be self-supporting or contained in an optional Support 46  which may be a chamber 76 of a device or a throwaway  component.   In FIG. 10 the formulation is a high viscosity liquid, gel,   paste or semi-solid.   FIG. 11 illustrates an injectate comprising a plurality of  different formulations 42a, 42b and 42c. These could be  formulations with different release profiles or different active  ingredients, for example combination therapies. Though not  illustrated there could be membranes between the compo  nents e.g. lipid soluble membranes between water-soluble  formulations and or an end piece.   FIGS. 12, 13 and 14 illustrate injectates with different solid  formulations. In FIG. 12 the solid formulation takes the form  ofbeads 46. In FIGS. 13 and 14 they are granules, particles or  crystals 48.   In FIG. 15 a barrier 50 is shown between the formulation 42   and the pioneer projectile 10.   The skilled man will of course realise that the features  illustrated with reference to one embodiment could easily be  applied to other embodiments.   An injectate will be introduced into a human or animal  using a device that injects the injectate in a needleless manner.  One such device is illustrated by way of example only in   FIG. 16.   The needleless injection device 60 is shown in the primed  position. It comprises an outer housing or holder 62 the low  ermost end 64 of which is slidably mounted over the upper  most end 66 of an innermost casing 68.   At the lowermost end 70 of innermost casing 68 is fitted a  disposable component 72 Such as, for example, a drug cas  sette. The disposable component comprises a casing 74 hav  ing a central aperture or chamber 76 in which is mounted the  injectate 40 comprising the pioneer projectile 10 and the  formulate 42. A large headed ejector pin 78 comprising a flat  head 80 and an elongate body 82 is positioned over the injec  tate 40 so that when the ejector pin is contacted, in use, by a  striker 84 it is pushed along the aperture or chamber 76 and  out into the patient. A resilient member 87, such as a rubber  block urges the ejector pin back a little after injection.   The disposable component 72 is loaded into the needleless  injection device, by for example, Screwing it into the lower  most end 70 of the inner housing 68.   Mounted within the innermost housing 68 is a striker guide  86 having a surface 88 which maintains a detent 90 in the  loaded position (shown) and houses an actuating mechanism  or spring 92 and spring follower 94.   The disposable component 72 is shaped such that when it is  in contact with the skin it pre-tensions it prior to actuation.  This ensures that the dosage will penetrate the skin rather than  just stretch the skin.   The injector pin 78 is designed to push the injectate beyond  the end of the device by up to (say) 2.5 mm. This means that  the end of the injector pin (which preferably has the same  profile and diameter as the end of the pioneer projectile)  might just penetrate the skin but it would ensure that the  injectate has been fully administered into the skin.   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   18  Prior to actuation, the tip of the injectate might be in con  tact with the skin. However, it is preferred that the tip is a few  millimeters away from the skin prior to  actuation.  This  ensures that the injectate is moving when it impacts the skin  and also ensures that the tip of the injectate does not start to  dissolve, and therefore soften the tip, with any moisture from  the skin surface when the device is placed on the skin.   To use the device 60 the outer most casing is retracted  (pulled in the direction of arrow A) so that it slides against the  innermost housing 68. This action causes the spring 92 to be  compressed, and the detent to be moved from a vertical posi  tion to the position shown where it  is held stable against  surface 88. In the process a quill spring 96 stabilises the detent  by abutting against a surface 98. Once loaded the disposable  component, is screwed into the end 70 of the innermost hous  ing 68 of the device 60.   The injector pin 78 that pushes the injectate into the skin is  preferably, (but not necessarily) in contact with the injectate  prior to actuation.   To actuate the device a user, for example, grips the device  around the outer housing 62 with their thumb over the end cap  102. The end face 100 of the disposable component 72 is  positioned against a patient\u2019s skin, which should be held  taught, and the outer housing 62 is pushed in a direction away  from arrow A. This action causes the outermost casing to slide  over the inner housing 68. As it does so the detent is caused to  rotate about it's axle 104 as a result of the detent riding up  inclined wall 106. This forces the quill spring 96 out (as  shown by the broken line). When the detent reaches a vertical  position the coil spring releases its stored energy and assists in  ensuring the striker 84 travels along the striker guide 86 until  it contacts the head 80 of the ejector pin 78 with a force that  causes the injectate 40 to pierce the skin. The ejector pin 78  continues to push the formulation 42 into the patient to the  required depth, which is determined by the length of the  injectate and the extent to which it is pushed by the ejector pin  78. The rubber stop 87 is squashed by the ejector pin head 80  during delivery of the injectate but the elastic properties of the  rubber stop 87 enable the tip of the ejector pinto be withdrawn  into the disposable component 72 of the device.  Injection Sites   The injectate could potentially be injected in a wide num  ber of sites across the human or animal body. The easiest  direction to administer the injectate is perpendicular to the  skin and so with most skin sites this would mean penetrating  the epidermis into the dermis and, depending on the skin  thickness, into the subcutaneous layers or muscle. The best  injection sites might therefore be those where there is the  Smallest density of nerve endings to avoid any pain that might  be associated with the injection. This might include injections  to the back or to the lobe of the ear.   Alternatively, injection sites might include those with a  thicker epidermis so that the injectate does not penetrate into  the dermis where the nerve endings are located. The injectate  might be injected obliquely into the skin so that it is located  totally in the epidermis. The same result might beachieved by  injection into a fold of skin that has been pinched.   The elastic properties of the skin can be employed to seal  the skin after the injectate has been administered, as is often  the case with splinters. This ensures the drug does not leak  from the skin as it dissolves.   The most likely area of the body for drug administration  with this technology is the stomach because of the high fat  content and easy accessibility for self-administration. An  alternative might be the thigh although this is often less acces  sible if the recipient is wearing trousers.   \fUS 8,574,188 B2   19   Product Applications   There are many possible product applications for this tech  nology because of the doses that are achievable including  therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic applications. Illus  trative examples include, but are not limited to:  Conventional Vaccines\u2014first and third world applications or   5   Veterinary applications;   Insulin;  Migraine Treatments; and  Hormones.   The term \u201cat least one therapeutic compound or a formu  lation containing at least one therapeutic compound as used  in this application is intended to cover prophylactic and diag  nostic applications as well as therapeutic applications.   The maximum dose that could be delivered using the tech  nique will depend upon a number of factors. However, an  injectate with an overall length of approximately 4.0 mm and  a diameter of approximately 1.0 mm (similar to a 19G ven  flon) would be sufficient to allow a dose of approximately 2  mg of a standard therapeutic in one administration. This mag  nitude of dose would be suitable for each of the applications  exemplified above. If several doses of injectate are delivered  simultaneously then there is the potential for an even larger  number of applications.   Delivery of the injectate will be very quick and any pain  associated with the delivery technique should not be any  worse than a needle of similar dimensions. If the delivery  technique were painful then it would be possible to anaesthe  tise the tissue prior to the injection. To avoid needles then this  anaesthetic might be given with a patch, a spray or a cream.  The device illustrated in FIG. 17 is a (reusable) drug deliv  ery device (210), with a packaged drug (2100) fitted thereto.  It comprises very few components. They include  i) a housing (212);  ii) a means (214) for generating a force capable of pushing a  drug (216) from a packaging (218) into a human or animal  body;   iii) a means (220) for transmitting said force to push the drug  (216) from the packaging (218) into the human or animal  body;   iv) a means (222) for receiving a packaged drug (2100);  V) a means (224) for priming the device; and  vi) a means (238.242b) for triggering the device.   In the embodiment shown the device is primed and trig   gered in a single action.   The delivery device (210) which may be absent of the  packaged drug (2100) is spring powered. It can deliver the  drug or a formulation containing a therapeutic compound  (hereafter drug) in a solid, semi-solid or liquid form. By  altering the form of the packaged drug (2100) the device can  be used to either deliver drugs through a retractable needle  (FIG. 20), or behind a \u201cpioneer projectile\u201d (FIGS. 19 and 21).  It can also be used to deliver a solid drug splinter.   Looking at the device in more detail it comprises a number  of components which are readily assembled and easily steri  lised making manufacture cheap.   The body of the device comprises a three part housing  (212) comprising a first housing component (212a) defining  an upper barrel (228) which houses the force generating  means (214), a second housing component (212b) defining a  lower barrel (230) which houses the packaged drug (2100)  and the means (220) for transmitting the force to push the  drug (216) from its packaging (218). The first and second  housing components (212a: 212b) connect to one another,  and a third housing component (212c), which preferably  takes the form of a screw cap (232), fits over the end of the first  housing component to close off the upper barrel (228).   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   20  Within the upper barrel (228) is fitted the means (214) for  generating the force capable of pushing the drug (216) from  its packaging. In the embodiment shown this takes the form of  a mechanical coil spring which can generate a force of from  about 10-40N, more preferably 15-35 N and most preferably  18-31 N. The spring is connected at its lower end to a spring  follower (236) which is slidably mounted in the upper barrel  (228). Above the spring is a compression bar (234) which  provides a contact Surface against which the spring can act.  By screwing or unscrewing the cap (232) from the housing  component (212a) the spring can be caused to compress or  relax thereby providing a means for adjusting the force that  can be generated by it.  In FIG. 17 the spring is shown at  minimum pre-load.   The upper barrel (228) and lower barrel (230) are separated  from one another by a wall (242) with a communicating  aperture (243) therein and it is on the upper surface (242a) of  this wall that the spring follower (236) sits. The means (220)  for transmitting the force generated by the spring takes the  form of an impact hammer one end (220a) of which passes  through the communicating aperture (243) where it contacts  spring follower (236). In use the uppermost end (220a) of the  impact hammer slides through the communicating aperture  (243) pushing the spring follower (236) up the upper barrel  (228) causing the spring to be compressed thus priming the  device.   Within the lower barrel is housed not only the majority of  the impact hammer (220), but a slewing spring (244) and a  sliding piston (248) having an aperture (246) therein, Such  that the lower barrel can operatively communicate with the  packaged drug (2100) which is secured to the device via the  receiving means (222) provided at the devices lowermost end  (249).   The slewing spring functions to draw the longitudinal axis  of the impact hammer off centre (FIG.18a) in the devices rest  position. However, the hammer is adapted by way of a shaped  shoulder region (238), (which in a preferred embodiment is  substantially frustoconical, as illustrated) to be drawn into  axial alignment with the aperture (246) in the sliding piston,  against the action of the slewing spring (244). Such that when  it is fully primed the device automatically actuates. Accord  ingly the lowermost surface (242b) of the wall (242) is shaped  to receive the shaped shoulder region (238) of the impact  hammer and cause the impact hammer to be axially aligned  with the aperture (246) in the sliding piston (248) such that it  is driven by the spring (214) through the aperture (246) in the  sliding piston (248) where it contacts a drive pin (2108) or  other element causing the drug (216) to be pushed out of its  packaging (218) into the human or animal. In contrast with  the FIG. 17 embodiment it should also be noted that the end  (220a) of the impact hammer graduates to a point (being  Substantially conical) and is seated in a similarly shaped  recess (236a) in the spring follower (236). The shaping of the  hammer end (220a) and the provision of the similarly shaped  recess (236a) in the spring follower (236) further improves  reliability of actuation.   By comparison of FIG. 18a with FIGS. 18b and c it will be  apparent that once a packaged drug (2100) has been attached  to the lower most end (249) of the device (210) it can be  actuated by a user holding the device about it\u2019s housing (212)  and pressing the device (210) firmly against the patients skin.  This causes first the skin to be tensioned and then the pack  aged drug (2100) slides up the lower chamber (230) pushing  the piston (248) which in turn pushes the impact hammer  (220). As it  does so the upper end (220a) of the impact  hammer pushes against the spring follower (236) causing the  spring (214) to be compressed until the necessary drive force   \fUS 8,574,188 B2   21  is reached. This is at the point illustrated in FIG. 18b. At this  point the shaped shoulder region. (238) is drawn into the  shaped lowermost surface (242b) of wall (242), the action of  the slewing spring (244) is countered, the spring (214) is fully  charged and the impact hammer (220) axially aligned with the  aperture (246) in the sliding piston (248) such that it will  automatically actuate, the spring (214) forcing the impact  hammer (220) through the aperture (246) in the piston (248)  causing it to push the drive pin (2108) which in turn, depend  ing on the mechanism employed in the packaged drug (2100)  (see FIGS. 19 to 21) causes the drug to be dispensed into the  human or animal. Significantly the longitudinal axis of the  impact hammer can\u2019t be aligned with the aperture (246) in the  sliding piston (248) until it reaches the set actuating force  which is set to coincide with the point at which the shaped  shoulder region (238) contacts the shaped lowermost surface  (242b) of wall (242) thus providing a safety  mechanism  against accidental actuation. When it reaches this point trig  gering is automatic and the device is actuated (FIG. 18c).   It should be noted that on actuation the hammer moves only  a short distance, less than 10 mm, more preferably less than 5  mm and typically about 3 mm before impacting the drive pin  and therefore moves (say) approx 5 mm before the pioneer  projectile strikes the skin. This means that the maximum  force and impact are all in the first few millimeters of travel,  when the maximum force is  required to pierce the skin.  Through the rest of the delivery, the force is reducing as the  main spring power is diminishing and also the slewing spring  is being compressed (FIG. 18c). This means that the force  tapers off during the second half of the delivery when less  force is required.   Therefore the force profile through the whole delivery  matches the requirements i.e.  a high force and impact to  pierce the skin and then a reduced force to push the injectate  into the skin.   In the case of a reusable device the packaged drug is  removed from the device and discarded. The slewing spring  will assist in this action. As the packaged drug (2100) is  removed from the device the slewing spring (244) acts to  draw the impact hammer (220) so that it is not axially aligned  with the aperture (246) in the piston (248) and the device  (210) is ready to receive a new packaged drug.   Such a device can be used to dispense a drug in a variety of   different forms depending on how it is packaged.   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   To demonstrate the versatility of the device three different  designs (FIGS. 19, 20, and 21) of packaged drug (2100) are  illustrated  as  suitable  for use with  the device. All  three  embodiments illustrate the dispensing of a single dose but the  skilled man will appreciate that multi-doses could also be  dispensed simultaneously or sequentially with the device of 50  the invention. Similarly, the device could be produced in a  pre-primed form with the packaged drug forming an integral  part of the device.   Referring to FIG. 19, in one embodiment the packaged  drug (2100) takes the form of an end piece which is adapted  to be slidably mountable in the device (210). The packaging  (218) takes the form of a two-piece housing (2.18a, 218b).  thereby simplifying construction and assembly. A first hous  ing element (218a) is the shape of a hollow inverted \u201cT\u201d and  comprises a region (2102) (the stem of the \u201cT\u201d) which serves  in use to slidably engage the device (210) allowing the pack  aged drug to slide up the lower chamber (230) of the device  (210), and a \u201ccross piece  against which the second element  (218b) abuts. A central channel (2106a) runs through the  middle of the stem exiting at the crosspiece. The second  element (218b) comprises an end (2104) which is shaped to  tension the skin. The second element (218b) is also substan   55   60   65   22  tially the shape of an inverted T and has a channel (2106b)  running down the centre axis of the inverted T. The respective  channels (2106a, 2106b) communicate with one another to  form a single channel (2106) which runs right through the  packaging (218). The channel (2106b) houses a pioneer pro  jectile (2110) and the drug (216) or a drug splinter (effectively  2110, 216), the skin contacting end of which is set a few  millimeters in from the skin tensioning surface of the device  to ensure it is moving at the requisite speed when it contacts  the skin. It also houses the lower end (2108b) of the drive pin  (2108). At the end remote from the skin tensioning surface the  channel (2106b) opens out to house a resilient member e.g. a  spring (2114). The placing of a resilient member under the  head (2108a) of the drive pin allows the drive pin to be  withdrawn backinto the housing immediately after actuation.  The drive pin (2108) is slidably mounted in the channel  (2106) so that when the head is depressed by the hammer of  the device the drive pin moves down the channel pushing the  pioneer projectile and drug (2110, 2216) from the channel  (106b) into the human or animal body. The pioneer projectile  (2110) and drug (216) are held in place in the channel (2106b)  by, for example, a breakable membrane (not shown) or appro  priate frictional means e.g. one or more markings or splines  on either the pioneer projectile, drug and or channel (2106b)  Surface.   The packaged drug illustrated in FIG. 19 is suitable for the  injection of a \u201ccontained  drug behind a pioneer projectile  which can penetrate the skin and create a channel into which  the drug is pushed as described. This type of packaged drug is  also suitable for the administration of drug splinters or rods of  a solid therapeutic compound which have a sharp tip as per  WO 94/22423. The therapeutic compound or therapeutic  compound and tip are initially located in the channel (2106)  of the packaging (218). The distal end (2108b) of the drive pin  may or may not be in contact with the uppermost end of the  therapeutic compound prior to actuation. When the drive pin  head (2108a) is struck by the impact hammer the drive pin  (2108) pushes the therapeutic compound (and pioneer pro  jectile, if included) into the target tissue.   The end of the drive pin may just penetrate the outer layers  of the skin to ensure that the therapeutic compound is com  pletely delivered into the skin. Alternatively, the packaged  drug may include a short rod (or rods) of a placebo or phar  maceutical compound between the end of the drive pin and  the therapeutic compound, which can be used to push the  therapeutic compound fully into the skin. In this case it would  not matter if the placebo rods entered the skin but it would  ensure that the drive pin did not have to penetrate the skin. The  benefits of this are that the drive pin would not be left pro  truding from the packaged drug following the administration  and would not be contaminated with bodily fluids and it  would therefore not pose a health risk in terms of disposal. An  alternative is to include a piece of rubber or foam, or as  illustrated a light spring (2114), under the head (2108a) of the  drive pin to ensure that the tip of the drive pin is withdrawn  into the spent packaging after administration.   FIG. 20 illustrates an alternative design of a packaged drug  for use with a device according to the invention. The pack  aged drug comprises a two piece housing (218a, 218b) which  is identical to that of the FIG. 19 embodiment. This simplifies  manufacture as the housing components can be used for a  packaged drug which is solid (as per the FIG. 19 embodi  ment) or one which is liquid. In order to be adapted to dis  pense a liquid a needle (2112) sits in the channel (2106), its  lower end (2112b) being in the channel (2106b) of housing  component (218b) and its upper end (2112a) extending into  the channel (2106a) of housing component (218b). The   \fUS 8,574,188 B2   23  needle (2112) is obliquely cut at both ends to provide sharp  points. Attached to the upper end (2112a) of the needle is a  support plate (2113) on which is seated a resilient or com  pressible spacer (2126) which extends above the tip of the  upper end (2112a) of the needle. Seated on the spacer (2126)  5  immediately above the tip of the needle (2112) is a liquid drug  containing receptacle (2120). The receptacle comprises one  or more side walls (2121) and a puncturable base (2122)  which together define a receptacle cavity which is filled with  the drug (216) through an opening (2124). The receptacle is  10  sealed by a drive pin or element (2108) which sits in the  receptacle opening (2124).   In use the hammer of the drug delivery device contacts the  drive element head (2108a) causing the receptacle to be  pushed down the channel (2106a) of the housing element  15  (218a). The spacer (2126) is compressed causing the needle  to puncture the base (2122). Consequently the needle (2112)  is filled by some of the drug contents (216) of the receptacle  thereby expelling air from the needle prior to piercing of the  skin and delivery of the drug. The force exerted on the support  20  plate (2113) forces the needle into the skin where the liquid  drug contents (216) drain into the human or animal through  the tract formed by the needle (2112). As the user of the  device removes the device from the skin, the drug package is  pushed substantially out of the end of the device by the action  25  of the slewing spring, and the needle is withdrawn into the  drug package by the action of the spring (2114).   In yet a further embodiment, and as illustrated in FIG. 21  there is a packaged drug (2100) which is adapted to hold a  drug (216) in any state, liquid, semi Solid or Solid. As in the  30  previous embodiments the housing (218) preferably takes the  form of a two piece housing (218a, 218b)although in this case  the housing elements are  shaped differently.  In  channel  (2106b) of the second housing element (218b) is housed a  pioneer projectile (2110) and the lowermost part of a drug 35  containing receptacle (2120) in the form of a thin walled  metal  tube which is  sealed with a breakable membrane  (2122). The tube terminates at its uppermost end in a lip  (2121) on which rest a pair of flexible arms (2128) of a drive  element (2108). The receptacle is sealed by the drive element 40  (2108). At the end remote from the skin tensioning surface of  the second housing element (218b) is  a ramped Surface  (2130). The uppermost part of the drug containing receptacle  (2120) and the drive element (2108) sit in a cavity between the  housing elements (218a, 218b) and which can be considered 45  an extension of channel (2106a) formed in the first housing  element (218a). The end (2104) in this embodiment is par  ticularly well Suited to skin tensioning and includes an annu  lar ring (2105) located immediately about the channel (2106)  exit. The annular ring in this embodiment is about 3 mm in  50  diameter (including the channel which is about 1  mm in  diameter) and depth. By way of comparison the end (2104)  has a diameter of about 16 mm. The depth and width need not  be 3 mm by 3 mm but should generally be in the range 1.5 mm  to 6 mm. Any more than this and it  may cause pain and 55  bruising and any less than this and it  may not adequately  tension the skin. This annular ring which may be a whole ring  or a broken ring comprising a number of projecting elements  disposed in a substantially annular fashion about the channel  exit could be a feature of any embodiment. To simplify con-  60  struction in this embodiment the drive pin head (2108a) is  produced as separate component to the lower and elongate  end (2108b) of the drive pin.   In use the hammer of the drug delivery device contacts the  drive element head (2108a) causing the receptacle to be  65  pushed down the channel (2106b) as a consequence of the  force exerted by the flexible arms (2128) of the drive element   24  (2108) against the lip (2121) of the receptacle (2120). This  causes the pioneer projectile (2110) to be pushed into the  patient. Once the pioneer projectile has entered the patient the  flexible arms (2128) of the drive element (2108) contact the  ramp surface (2130) of the second housing element (218b)  and are caused to flex apart and ride over the lip (2121) and/or  snap. As a consequence the lower part (2108b) of the drive  element is able to move down the receptacle (2120) pushing  the drug (216) contents out into a tract formed by the pioneer  projectile (2110). Preferably the end of the receptacle which  takes the form of a thin walled tube just enters the skin before  the drug is delivered. This ensures that if a liquid drug is used  the drug follows the pioneer projectile into the skin rather  than escaping along the skin Surface.   The main advantage of the FIG. 21 embodiment is for the  injection of liquids as it ensures that the liquid is contained  during the administration and is guided by the thin walled  metal tube into the target tissue. However, the drug contents  need not be restricted to liquids.   A feature of the device illustrated which further distin  guishes it from other hand powered systems is that the force  generated by the spring is the delivery force and there is  Substantially no additional force generated by the operator  due to the gradual priming and instantaneous actuation when  the device reaches the delivery force set.   In contrast devices which include a breaktab or other snap  means to actuate the device can\u2019t have the force carefully  controlled and as a consequence the greater the force exerted  by the user the greater the velocity of impact by the drug with  the skin.   With the system detailed in this application the hand force  compresses the main spring to a preset point at which the drug  package is inserted to virtually its maximum point within the  device. At this point the actuation takes place and the prede  termined spring strength delivers the drug. Any extra force by  the hand is dissipated over the whole of the area of the end of  the device.   An alternative way of viewing this is to consider the skinas  a sponge. In devices utilising Snap tabs, when the Snap tabs  are broken all the force by the hand is pushing the drug and the  resilience of the skin will start to push the bottom half of the  device (part not held in hand) back towards the hand. This  may result in a less good seal with the skin and, in theory, if  the hand force stops immediately the Snap tabs are broken  then the drug would never be pushed from the device - they  rely on the inertia in the hand to make the injection. In practice  this means that the user pushes and pushes and then Suddenly  the tabs break and the device is pushed into the target possibly  causing pain and bruising with the device. In the present  injection the skin is compressed by a steady hand force. At the  point of actuation the main spring controls the delivery of the  drug and the hand maintains (but does not Suddenly increase)  the force on the skin to ensure a good contact with the skin. If  at any point before actuation the sensation on the skin is  painful then the injection site can be altered or the injection  aborted rather than causing further pain and/or bruising.   Devices of the type described have been demonstrated by  the applicant to be capable of delivering a drug as demon  strated by the following examples:   EXAMPLES   Initial experiments were carried out with non pharmaceu  tical materials to demonstrate the delivery concept. These  experiments comprised the following:   \fUS 8,574,188 B2   25  Example 1   Drug Splinters   A rod of 0.9 mm diameter pencil lead was broken to lengths  of approximately 6 mm and a point was sanded on one end of  each length and a flat on the other to create solid splinters. The  splinters were placed in the drug package shown in FIG. 19  and Successfully administered to pig skin using a prototype  delivery system.   Example 2   Pioneer Projectile Followed by a Solid Rod   The same pencil lead detailed in example 1 above was cut  into short lengths of approximately 3 mm in length. These had  a point Sanded on one end and a flat on the other end to create  pioneer projectiles. Further rods of the same pencil lead were  cut at approximately 4 mm in length and had both ends Sanded  flat. When a pioneer projectile and a solid rod were placed in  a drug package as shown in FIG. 19 they were successfully  administered to pig skin using a prototype delivery system.  Example 3   25   Pioneer Projectile Followed by a Soft Rod   A soft rod of wax was extruded through a die and rods of  approximately 4 mm in length were cut with a flat at each end.  Further sections were cut with a point at one end and a flat at  the other end. When a pointed section (identical in shape and  size to the splinter used in example 1) was administered to pig  skin using a drug package as shown in FIG. 19 the wax did not  pierce the skin but was flattened on the skin surface. When a  rod of the same waxy material was placed behind a pioneer  projectile used in example 2 and administered to pig skin  using a drug package as shown in FIG. 19 then both the  pioneer projectile and the waxy material were successfully  delivered into  the tissue. The wax material used for this  experiment could easily be squashed between a finger and a  thumb.   5   10   15   35   40   45   Example 4   Pioneer Projectile Followed by Solid Beads.   Beads of diameters 0.5-0.75 mm were placed in a drug  package, as shown in FIG. 19, behind a pioneer projectile as  detailed in example 2. The pioneer projectile and all the beads  were successfully administered to pig skin using a prototype  delivery system.   The experiments outlined above demonstrated that a range  of different materials could be delivered behind a solid pio  neer projectile. Ideally it is preferred that the pioneer projec  tile is manufactured from pharmaceutical grade compounds  that will dissolve in the target tissue. Two processes have been  used to produce Such pioneer projectiles as outlined below:  Example 5   50   55   60   A hot melt of Sugars is produced which can then be moul  ded into the correct form for a pioneer projectile or extruded  to produce long rod. If an extrusion process is used then the  pioneer projectiles can be cut to shape from the Soft extrudate  or the sharp ends of the pioneer projectile can beformed when  the extrudate has solidified. This process produces a material   30   said upper barrel;   26  similar to a boiled sweet which can be very hard and incor  porate a sharp point on one end.   Example 6   A mix of powders is produced using pharmaceutical grade  Sugars together with a hardening agent such as polyvinylpy  rolidone (PVP). The powder blend is extruded through a die  to produce a long rod of the compound. Some blends require  a lubricant to facilitate the extrusion and binding process Such  as water or ethanol. The pioneer projectiles are formed by  cutting the long rod into short sections. This process can be  facilitated by using a hot knife. If necessary, the point or flat  end of the pioneer projectile can be created by Sanding or  filing a short rod of the extrudate.   We claim:  1.

MULT-DOSE DRUG DELIVERY DEVICE  AND METHOD   CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED  APPLICATIONS   5   The present application claims benefit to U.S. Provisional  Application No. 61/416,455, filed Nov. 23, 2010. This appli  cation is incorporated herein by reference.   10   BACKGROUND   This disclosure is generally in the field of implantable  medical  devices.  In  particular,  the  disclosure  relates  to  implantable devices for drug release over an extended period.  Implantable devices for the delivery of drugs to patients  over extended periods are known. U.S. Pat. No. 5,797,898,  U.S. Pat. No. 6,527,762, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,491,666, and  U.S. Pat. No. 6,976,982 describe devices for the storage and  controlled release of drug formulations from multi-reservoir  devices. One category of the devices provide passive con  trolled release of multiple, individual doses of drug. The  reservoirs contain a release system which comprises a drug.  That is, the release system of each reservoir can be individu  ally  programmed,  e.g.,  formulated, to provide selected  kinetics of drug release, controlling both the time at which  release is initiated and the rate at which the drug is released.  Release from different reservoirs can be staggered to provide  complex release profiles. Reservoir caps may be provided to  close off reservoir openings until Such time as release of the  drug is desired.  Reservoir caps are designed to passively  disintegrate or become permeable in Vivo to initiate drug  release.   It would be desirable to provide improved designs of such  implantable devices for therapeutic or prophylactic treat  ments. It would in particular be desirable to provide small  devices for precise, local (e.g., pinpoint) delivery of a drug  over an extended period precisely to selected tissue sites,  wherein the device has a relatively high drug volume to device  Volume ratio and can be implanted into a patient by a mini  mally invasive technique. It would be further desirable to  provide devices having a relatively simple design that can be  readily fabricated and assembled from relatively few compo  nentS.   15   25   30   35   40   45   SUMMARY   50   Embodiments of the present devices and methods address  at least some of the foregoing needs.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION   Implantable drug delivery devices have been developed  that provide for the passively controlled release of drug,  wherein the device has a high ratio of drug formulation vol  ume to total device volume and the device can be deployed  into a patient using minimally invasive conventional tech  niques and instruments.   In exemplary embodiments, the drug delivery device is  shaped to allow insertion through a conventional needle (e.g.,  large gauge hypodermic needle or with a trocar) into a spe  cific location in the body of a patient, Such as a human or other  mammal in need of treatment or prophylaxis. The targeted  tissue location may be, for example, a lumen other than the  vasculature, Subcutaneous space, intramuscular, in a specific  organ/tumor mass, peritoneal cavity, duodenum, intracranial  cavity or brain tissue, or pleural space. The entire implantable  drug delivery device is completely implanted into the targeted  tissue or tissues, as distinct from a catheter, at least a portion  of which generally protrudes/extends from the patient\u2019s body.  Alternatively, the drug delivery device may be sized and  shaped for oral administration. Embodiments of the drug   \fUS 8,679,093 B2   3  delivery  devices  described  herein  advantageously  are  designed to provide a hermetic drug delivery device that is  Suitable for being packaged (e.g., in a sterile metal foil) and  stored for a prolonged period of time (e.g., months to years)  prior to being opened and implanted into the body of a patient.  Device Body and Structure   Generally described, an embodiment of an implantable  drug delivery device comprises at least two housing units  connected together end-to-end in a fixed, linear orientation.  In exemplary embodiments, the devices have two or more  discrete dose units of drug formulation disposed therein. Each  housing unit has an exterior Surface and an interior Surface,  the exterior Surfaces of the connected housing units defining  a sidewall of the device.  The housing units are located  between a first end piece defining a first end of the device and  a second end piece defining a second end of the device distal  to the first end of the device. At least two discrete dose units  are disposed within the housing units located between the first  and second end pieces.  The device may further include  degradable timing members connected to the housing units,  e.g., connecting adjacent housing units, and separating the  discrete dose units from one another. In embodiments, the  first and second end pieces comprise degradable timing mem  bers. The timing members, the first end piece/degradable  timing member/second end piece, and the interior Surface of  the housing unit to which the first end piece/degradable tim  ing member/second end piece is connected together define a  reservoir in which one of the dose units is disposed.   Desirably, the device is configured to control the release of  each discrete dose unit when the device is deployed in vivo.  For example, in an embodiment the device may be adapted to  release a first discrete dose unit following rupture of the first  or second end piece, and Subsequently to release a second  discrete dose unit following rupture of a degradable timing  member. The device may release one or more additional  discrete dose units following rupture of one or more addi  tional degradable timing members. The dose unit may be a  drug provided with or without excipients and with or without  a matrix material.   In a preferred embodiment, the drug contains very little or  no excipient in order to maximize the amount of drug per  Volume of the dose unit. For example, the dose unit may  contain between 85 and 99 percent drug, e.g., 90 to 95 percent  drug, with the remainder being one or more excipients useful  for forming Solid units. Such as tablets.   In another exemplary embodiment, an implantable drug  delivery device comprises at least two solid units of a drug  formulation which comprises at least one drug. The Solid  units each have a proximal end, a distal end, and one or more  longitudinal exterior surfaces therebetween. At least one seal  member is sandwiched between the proximal end of a first  Solid unit and the distal end of a second Solid unit. A coating  layer that is substantially non-permeable covers at least the  longitudinal exterior surfaces of the solid units. Desirably, the  device is adapted to control the release of the drug from the  solid units at least in part by the in vivo disintegration of the  seal member. In particular embodiments, the coating layer is  adapted to disintegrate in Vivo after the in vivo disintegration  of the seal member and release of the drug from the plurality  of solid units.   The devices provided herein may be any shape and size  Suitable for delivery in a minimally invasive manner. In par  ticular embodiments the device is elongated in shape, a non  limiting example of which includes a substantially tubular (or  cylindrical) shape. As used herein, the term \u201celongated\u201d is  used broadly to include without limitation a shape wherein  the longitudinal axis is longer than a lateral axis of the device.   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   4  It  should be understood  that  there  are  many elongated  implantable device geometries that could embody the con  cept of employing the discrete dose units described herein,  and is not limited to a Substantially tubular design. In a pre  ferred embodiment, the device is in the form of a straight,  rigid, elongated tube.   Any suitable number of reservoirs (including the housing  units, dose units, and degradable timing members/seal mem  bers) may be disposed in the devices provided herein. Desir  ably, the device comprises a sufficient number of reservoirs  having a fill ratio of drug formulation volume to device vol  ume of greater than about 50% (e.g., greater than about 55%,  greater than about 60%, greater than about 75%, or greater  than about 85%). In particular embodiments, the device com  prises at least two reservoirs. In other particular embodi  ments, the device comprises from two to fifty reservoirs. In  still other embodiments the device comprises from three to  twenty dose reservoirs, from three to ten reservoirs, or from  five to ten dose reservoirs (e.g., seven reservoirs). More or  fewer reservoirs are also envisioned. The reservoirs within a  single device may be the same size. Alternatively, Some res  ervoirs may be larger than others. For example, the first dose  may be larger, functioning as a bolus to drive the drug con  centration to a therapeutically effective level, and Subsequent  doses are Smaller and serve as maintenance doses. Alterna  tively, the first dose or first few doses may be smaller than  Subsequent doses, for example, for the purpose of \u201cweaning  the patient to the drug.  Housing Units   In embodiments, the two or more housing units form a  sidewall of the drug delivery device. The sidewall may be  formed using a material that is relatively non-permeable to  the bodily fluids over the duration of drug release. As used  herein, the term \u201cnon-permeable\u201d refers to a material that  substantially prevents the movement of fluids and molecules  through the material for the duration of drug delivery. For  example, in particular embodiments the sidewalls are formed  of a material that is substantially non-permeable for at least  one week, for at least two weeks, or longer, when deployed in  vivo. In some embodiments, the sidewall also aids in protect  ing the drug from exposure to moisture and/or oxygen during  shipping and storage of the device before use.   In particular embodiments, the housing units are formed of  a biocompatible polymer. In a preferred embodiment, the  housing units are formed of a bioerodible polymer. As used  herein, the term \u201cbioerodible\u201d refers to a material that even  tually is absorbed by the body, for example by the conversion  of a material that initially is insoluble in aqueous systems into  a material that is soluble in aqueous systems or by hydrolysis  or enzymatic cleavage of the polymer. The term \u201cbioerodible'  includes materials that degrade in vivo by \u201csurface erosion.\u201d  \u201cbiodegradation' and/or \u201cbioresorption\u201d as understood in the  art. Non-limiting examples of bioerodible polymers include  poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), or poly(lactic-co-gly  colic  acid)S,  and poly(anhydride-co-imides).  In  another  embodiment, the housing units may be constructed of a non  bioerodible material. Such as polycarbonate, liquid crystal  polymer, polyimide, polyurethane, or a combination thereof.  Dose Units/Solid Units and Drug Formulations   The two or more dose units/solid units comprise at least  one drug and/or drug formulation. A drug formulation is a  composition that comprises a drug. As used herein, the term  'drug  includes any therapeutic or prophylactic agent (e.g.,  an active pharmaceutical ingredient or API). The drug formu  lation may include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable  excipients, which are known in the art.   \fUS 8,679,093 B2   5  Depending on the particular device embodiment, the drug  formulation may be in essentially any form, Such as a pure  Solid, a semi-solid, a pure liquid, a gel or hydrogel, a solution,  an emulsion, a slurry, or a suspension. In a preferred embodi  ment, the drug formulation is in a monolithic, dry solid form,  or in the form of a collection of particles (e.g., microparticles  or nanoparticles), particularly for purposes of maintaining or  extending the stability of the drug over a commercially and  medically useful time, e.g., during storage in a drug delivery  device until the drug needs to be administered. These solid  forms may be provided by lyophilization of a drug solution or  suspension directly in the reservoirs. Alternatively, prefabri  cated pellets or microtablets that are approximately the size of  individual reservoirs may be formed outside the device (e.g.,  in a mold) and Subsequently loaded into the device, for  example, in an inert gas environment. The particular formu  lation in the reservoirs of a single device may be the same as  or different from one another across a plurality of the reser  Voirs.   The drug formulation may include a drug in combination  with other materials to control or enhance the rate and/or time  of release from the device. In various embodiments, the drug  formulation further includes one or more matrix materials. In  one example, the matrix material comprises one or more  synthetic polymers. Exemplary materials include synthetic  polymers, such as  PLGA, PEG, PLLA, and/or naturally  occurring polymers such as hyaluronic acid, chitosan, and  alginate. The natural-occurring polymers may or may not be  crosslinked by methods known to the art. In another example,  the one or more matrix materials comprise a biodegradable,  bioerodible, water-soluble, or water-swellable matrix mate  rial. In one embodiment, the therapeutic or prophylactic agent  is distributed in the matrix material and the matrix material  degrades or dissolves in vivo to controllably release the thera  peutic or prophylactic agent. The therapeutic or prophylactic  agent may be heterogeneously distributed in the dose unit/  Solid unit or may be homogeneously distributed in the dose  unit/solid unit. The degradation, dissolution, or diffusion  properties of the matrix material can provide a means for  controlling the release rate of the drug molecules.   The drug may comprise Small  molecules, large  (i.e.,  macro-) molecules, or a combination thereof. In one embodi  ment, the large molecule drug is a protein or a peptide.   Representative examples of Suitable drugs include vac  cines, vectors for gene therapy, polypeptides, nucleic acids  (DNA, siRNA), interferons, antibodies, anti-inflammatories,  hormones, and chemotherapeutic agents.  In various other  embodiments, the drug can be selected from amino acids,  vaccines, antiviral agents, gene delivery vectors, interleukin  inhibitors, immunomodulators, neurotropic factors, neuro  protective agents, antineoplastic agents, chemotherapeutic  agents, polysaccharides, anti-coagulants (e.g., LMWH, pen  tasaccharides), antibiotics (e.g., immunosuppressants), anal  gesic agents, and vitamins. Examples of Suitable types of  proteins include, glycoproteins, enzymes (e.g., proteolytic  enzymes), hormones or other analogs (e.g., LHRH, steroids,  corticosteroids, growth factors), antibodies (e.g., anti-VEGF  antibodies, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors), cytokines (e.g.,  Cl-,  3-, or Y-interferons), interleukins (e.g., IL-2, IL-10), and  diabetes/obesity-related therapeutics (e.g., insulin, exenatide,  PYY. GLP-1 and its analogs, rimonabant). In one embodi  ment, the drug is agonadotropin-releasing (LHRH) hormone  analog, Such as leuprolide. In another exemplary embodi  ment, the drug comprises parathyroid hormone, Such as a  human parathyroid hormone or its analogs, e.g., hPTH(1-84)  or hPTH(1-34). In a further embodiment, the drug is selected  from nucleosides, nucleotides, and analogs and conjugates   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   6  thereof. In yet another embodiment, the drug comprises a  peptide with natriuretic activity, such as atrial natriuretic pep  tide (ANP),  B-type (or brain) natriuretic  peptide (BNP),  C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), or dendroaspis natriuretic  peptide (DNP). In still  another embodiment, the drug is  selected from diuretics, vasodilators, inotropic agents, anti  arrhythmic agents, Ca\" channel blocking agents, anti-adren  ergics/sympatholytics, and renin angiotensin System antago  nists.  In one embodiment, the drug is a VEGF inhibitor.  VEGF antibody, VEGF antibody fragment, or another anti  angiogenic agent.  Examples include an aptamer. Such as  MACUGENTM (Pfizer/Eyetech)  (pegaptainib  sodium))  or  LUCENTISTM  (Genetech/Novartis)  (rhufab  VEGF,  or  ranibizumab), which could be used in the prevention of cho  roidal neovascularization (useful in the treatment of age  related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy). In yet  a further embodiment, the drug is a prostaglandin, a prosta  cyclin, or another drug effective in the treatment of peripheral  vascular disease. In still another embodiment, the drug is an  angiogenic agent, such as VEGF. In a further embodiment,  the drug is an anti-inflammatory Such as dexamethasone. In  one embodiment, a device includes both angiogenic agents  and anti-inflammatory agents. A single device may include a  single drug or a combination of two or more drugs.   The release of drug from the device may be tailored to  provide a temporally modulated release profile (e.g., pulsatile  release) when time variation in plasma levels is desired or a  more continuous or consistent release profile when a constant  plasma level as needed to enhance a therapeutic effect, for  example. Pulsatile release, or intermittent release, can be  achieved from an individual dose unit, from a plurality of  dose units, or a combination thereof. For example, where  each dose unit provides only a single pulse, multiple pulses  (i.e. pulsatile release) are achieved by temporally staggering  the single pulse release from each of several dose units. Alter  natively, multiple pulses can be achieved from a single dose  unit by incorporating several layers of a release system and  other materials into a single dose unit. Continuous release can  be achieved by incorporating a release system that degrades,  dissolves, or allows diffusion of molecules through it over an  extended period.  In  addition,  continuous  release  can be  approximated by releasing several pulses of molecules in  rapid succession.   In one embodiment, the drug formulation within a dose  unit comprises layers of a drug or drugs and a non-drug  material, wherein the multiple layers provide pulsed drug  release due to the intervening layers of non-drug. Such a  strategy can be used to obtain complex release profiles.  Discrete Timing and Seal Members   Dose units may be separated from each other by at least one  timing member or seal member, membrane, film, or other  structure. For example, a discrete timing member or seal  member may be disposed between each dose unit. The dis  crete timing member or seal member functions to protect the  dose unit (e.g.,  the drug formulation) until Such time as  release of the dose unit is desired. A discrete timing member  or seal member may be a thin film or other structure suitable  for separating a dose unit from the environment outside of the  device. The discrete timing members or seal members are  formed from a material or mixture of materials  that are  degradable. As used herein, the term \u201cdegradable' refers to a  material that will biodegrade, bioerode, dissolve, or other  wise rupture in contact with fluids and tissues in vivo.   Each of the discrete timing members or seal members are  designed to open at specified times, thereby delivering the  dose unit sequentially at pre-specified times. These discrete  timing members or seal  members may be independently   \fUS 8,679,093 B2   7  degraded or groups of the discrete timing members or seal  members may degrade Substantially  simultaneously.  For  example, in certain embodiments the discrete timing mem  bers or seal members disposed at distal ends of the device are  exposed to the environment outside of the device and degrade  Substantially simultaneously, Such that dose units are released  substantially simultaneously from distal ends of the device.  Desirably, the exposure of the dose unit to the environment is  passively controlled through the rupture of the discrete timing  member or seal member. In a passive control system for  example, the timing can be controlled by selecting the dis  crete timing member or seal member dimension, composi  tion, and structure.   The compositions of the discrete timing member or seal  member may be selected from materials that will rupture in  response to an environment existing in vivo in the patientorin  response to a component contained in the reservoir. Examples  of environmental conditions include, but are not limited to  temperature, water, pH, an electrolyte, and enzymes.   In preferred embodiments, the discrete timing members or  seal members are selected to degrade in vivo, without any  intervention  by  the  patient  or caregiver  (Subsequent  to  deployment). In one particular embodiment, the discrete tim  ing members or seal members are formed of a biocompatible  polymer, such as a poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), or  poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)S, as well as degradable poly(an  hydride-co-imides), of a composition and thickness designed  to  disintegrate by hydrolysis  in  a prescribed timeframe,  releasing the drug contained in the dose unit. For example, the  discrete timing member or seal member may have a thickness  ranging from about 0.1 mm to about 1.0 mm, e.g., 0.2 mm to  0.8 mm.   In a preferred embodiment, a discrete timing member or  seal member completely separates the dose units from each  other. In another embodiment, discrete timing members or  seal members separate only a portion of the dose units from  each other.   Representative examples of discrete timing members or  seal members include degradable polymeric and non-poly  meric materials. In a preferred embodiment, the discrete tim  ing members or seal members are formed of a bioerodible or  biodegradable material known in the art, such as a synthetic  polymer or copolymer, e.g., a polyester (such as PLGA), a  poly(anhydride), or a polycaprolactone. The discrete timing  members or seal members may be a multilayer structure. For  example an inner layer may be porous or otherwise control  diffusion once the outer, non-permeable layer has disinte  grated. The discrete timing members or seal members of a  single device may be made of different materials, may have  different thicknesses, may have different degrees of cross  linking, or a combination thereof, for the purpose of opening  different dose units at different times relative to one another.  Regardless of their construction, the timing members gener  ally are designed to degrade before the housing units can  degrade, or at least before the housing units degrade suffi  ciently to lose structural integrity that would adversely affect  the sequentially controlled release of the doses of drug.   Exemplary Embodiments   The foregoing embodiments of devices and methods for  their use can be further understood with reference to the  appended drawings and description below, where like num  bers refer to the same device or component.   An embodiment of a drug delivery device 100 illustrated in  FIGS. 1A-1C has a plurality of housing units 110, each hous  ing unit 110 having an exterior surface 112 and an interior   8  surface 114. Fifteen housing units are shown in FIG. 1A,  although other numbers are readily envisioned. The exterior  surfaces 112 of the connected housing units 110 define a  sidewall. The housing units 110 are located between a first  end piece 116 defining a first end of the device and a second  end piece 118 defining a second end of the device distal to the  first end of the device. Although not shown, the first and/or  second end piece may have a tapered or point end to facilitate  tissue penetration during the insertion/deployment process.  A plurality of discrete dose units 120, each comprising at  least one drug, are disposed within the housing units 110  located between the first 116 and second end pieces 118. The  dose unit may be a drug formulation which includes the at  least one drug. The device 110 further includes degradable  timing members 122 connected to the housing units 124 and  separating the discrete dose units 120 from one another. The  timing member 122, the first end piece 116 (or a second  timing member 122 or second end piece 118), and the interior  surface of the housing unit 114 to which the first end piece (or  a second timing member 122 or second end piece 118) is  connected together define a reservoir 124 in which one of the  dose units 120 is disposed. It should be appreciated that for  illustration purposes the dose units shown in FIGS. 1C and 1D  do not completely fill the reservoir 124. Each reservoir in  preferred embodiments would be completely or at least sub  stantially filled with the dose units so as to maximize the  amount of drug loaded in the device.   The device is adapted to release a first discrete dose unit  120 following rupture of the first 116 or second end piece 118,  and Subsequently to release a second discrete dose unit 120  following rupture of a degradable timing member 122. The  device subsequently releases one or more additional discrete  dose units 120 following rupture of one or more additional  degradable timing members 122. A schematic illustration of  the timed release from a drug delivery device according to the  foregoing embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 1D.   In one embodiment of the drug delivery device 110, one of  the housing units 110 has a flange 126 defining a shoulder  129. An end 127 of the other of the housing units is mated with  the flange 126 and the shoulder 129 of the adjacent housing  unit or end piece. The at least one timing member 122 may  comprise a flange 128 that is mated with the flange 126 of the  housing unit 110 and with the interior surface 114 of the  housing unit. The drug delivery device 100 optionally further  comprises a coating (e.g., a metalized film deposition or  polymer) on the exterior surfaces 112 of the housing units 110  as shown in FIG. 5.   Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the geometry  and dimensions of the drug delivery device and its compo  nents (i.e., housing unit, dose unit, degradable timing mem  ber, etc.) may be modified from the present description to  satisfy  various  design  needs.  Exemplary dimensions  of  devices are discussed below for FIGS. 3-4, with FIGS. 3A and  4A illustrating the housing units and FIGS. 3B and 4B illus  trating degradable timing members of embodiments of the  drug delivery device.   For example, in an exemplary embodiment the housing  unit 310 illustrated in FIG.3A has a length in the longitudinal  direction of approximately 0.040 inches, an exterior surface  312 diameter of approximately 0.040 inches, an interior sur  face 314 diameter (X) of approximately 0.030 inches, a flange  326 having a length of approximately 0.003 inches, a shoul  der 329 having a length of approximately 0.004 inches, and an  end 327 having a length of approximately 0.003 inches for  mating with the flange 326 and shoulder 329 of the adjacent  housing unit. In an embodiment, the relative interior Surface  and exterior Surface diameters of the housing units at the end   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   \fUS 8,679,093 B2   327 and flange 326 of the housing units, respectively, are such  that the flange 326 of a first housing unit snugly fits within the  end 327 of an adjacent second housing unit (illustrated in  FIG. 5). For example, in an embodiment the housing unit 310  of FIG. 3A may have an interior surface diameter at the end  327 of 0.0365 inches and an exterior surface 312 diameter at  the flange 326 of 0.0370 inches, such that the diameter of the  flange-side of the housing unit would be compressed when  mated with the adjacent housing unit. Alternatively, the hous  ing unit 310 of FIG.3A may have an interior surface diameter  at the end 327 of 0.037 inches and an exterior surface diam  eter at the flange 326 of 0.0365 inches, such that the diameter  of the flange-side of the housing unit would readily mate with  the end-side of the adjacent housing unit without being com  pressed. In embodiments, the degradable timing member 322  illustrated in FIG. 3B has an outer diameter of approximately  0.0335 inches and a width in the longitudinal direction of  approximately 0.010 inches. The degradable timing member  illustrated in FIG. 3B is  disposed within the overlapping  flange 326 and shoulder 329 of adjacent housing units 310  illustrated in FIG. 3A and may have a feature that interlocks  with a portion of the housing units 310 to improve the isola  tion of the adjacent reservoirs (FIG. 5). In certain embodi  ments, other means may be used to secure adjacent housing  units. For example, laser welds may be used to join circum  ferential seams of the housing units, a metalized film or other  coating  may be applied  to  the  exterior  Surface  of the  assembled housing units, or adhesives may be used to secure  adjacent housing units and degradable timing members.   The housing unit 410 and degradable timing member 422  illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B, respectively, are similar to  those illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B; however, they exclude  the interlocking feature of the housing units and degradable  timing members.   Another exemplary embodiment of a drug delivery device  is illustrated in FIG. 6. The device 200 comprises a plurality  of solid units 210 of a drug formulation which comprises at  least one drug. The solid units 210 each have a proximal end  212, a distal end 214, and one or more longitudinal exterior  surfaces 216 therebetween. At least one seal member 218 is  sandwiched between the proximal end 212 of a first solid unit  210 and the distal end 214 of a second solid unit 210. A  coating layer 220 covers at least the longitudinal exterior  surfaces 216 of the solid units 210. Desirably, the coating  layer 220 is substantially non-permeable such that release of  the drug from the solid units 210 is controlled at least in part  by the in  vivo disintegration of the seal member 218. In  particular embodiments, the solid units 210 each have a cylin  drically shaped exterior surface 216 and the seal member 218  is disk shaped.  Making the Devices   The basic methods of fabricating and assembling the drug  delivery devices described herein are known or can be readily  adapted from techniques known in the art. In one embodi  ment, the housing units, timing membranes, and seal mem  bers are made by casting or molding, such as by injection  molding. Micromachining and drilling processes may also be  used in the product of the components. The components can  be assembled and secured together using a variety of tech  niques including, but not limited to, the use of adhesives, heat  or solvent welding, and/or mechanical fasteners.  In  one  embodiment, two or more components may joined together  using laser welding.  Implanting/Using the Devices   The devices described herein can be used in a variety of  therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic medical applications.  In a preferred embodiment, the devices store and release an   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   10  effective amount of at least one drug formulation over an  extended period, e.g., between 1 week and 12 months.   The device may be implanted into a patient (Such as a  human or other vertebrate animal) using standard Surgical or  more preferably a minimally invasive implantation tech  nique, (e.g., by a small incision or injection through a needle,  trocar, cannula, catheter, or the like) or noninvasive implan  tation technique (e.g., Swallowing). Ultrasound, nuclear mag  netic resonance, virtual anatomic positioning systems, or  other imaging techniques may be employed to confirm proper  positioning of the implant.  In  various embodiments, the  administration system may include a catheter, wire, tube,  endoscope, or other mechanism capable of reaching the  desired recipientanatomic site through an incision, puncture,  trocar, or through an anatomic passageway Such as a vessel,  orifice, or organ lumen, or trans-abdominally or trans-tho  racically. In various embodiments according to the present  invention, the delivery system may be steerable by the opera  tOr.   In one embodiment, the device may be dimensioned for  delivery from a 6 to 26 gauge (approximately 0.439 inches to  0.241 inches nominal ID) needle. Larger or Smaller gauges of  modified needles may also be used to accommodate various  sized drug delivery devices described herein. It may be pref  erable to implant devices that have larger diameters using  means known in the art other than needles. In certain embodi  ments the drug delivery device may be inserted through a  Small incision, wherein the incision length is approximately  equal to the diameter of the device. In certain embodiments,  the drug delivery device described herein may be delivered  using apparatus and techniques described, for example, in  U.S. Pat. No. 7,214,206 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,104,945, which  are incorporated herein by reference.   Drug may then be passively released locally at the tissue  site of implantation using a preselected delivery profile (e.g.,  dosing schedule) based on the design of the particular device  as prescribed by the patient\u2019s physician. For example, in  embodiments the drug is released in a controlled and Sus  tained manner to provide a desired local or systemic physi  ological or pharmacological effect over a desired time period  (e.g.,  one weeks to  12 months). Alternatively, in  certain  embodiments the drug is released in a pulsatile manner to  provide the desired local or systemic physiological or phar  macological effect over the desired time period.

BOADHESIVE DRUG FORMULATIONS FOR  ORAL TRANSMUCOSAL DELVERY   CROSS REFERENCE TO OTHER  APPLICATIONS   This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. appli  cation Ser. No. 1 1/650,227, filed Jan. 5, 2007, the disclosure  of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.   10   FIELD OF THE INVENTION   The present invention relates to formulations for oral trans  mucosal drug delivery and methods for delivery of medica  tions across the oral mucosa using drug dosage forms com  prising Such formulations and methods for using the same.   15   BACKGROUND OF THE TECHNOLOGY   Oral dosage forms account for approximately eighty per  cent of all the drug dosage forms on the market. Oral dosage  forms are non-invasive, easily administered and have high  patient compliance.   Orally administered therapeutic agents are rapidly trans  ported to the stomach and Small intestine for absorption  across the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal membranes into the  blood. The efficiency of absorption of a drug following oral  administration can be low because of metabolism within the  GI tract and first-pass metabolism within the liver resulting in  relatively lengthy onset times or erratic absorption character  istics that are not well suited to control acute disorders. The  majority of oral dosage forms on the market are designed for  GI delivery. Relatively few oral dosage forms are designed for  delivery through the oral mucosa.   However, oral transmucosal delivery offers a number of  advantages in that it can provide a shorter onset time and more  consistent time (T,) to  maximal plasma concentration  (C) than oral delivery, in particular for lipophilic drugs.  This is because the drug rapidly passes directly and efficiently  through the epithelium of the highly vascularized mucosal  tissue to the plasma, thus rapidly reaching the circulation  while avoiding the slower, often inefficient and variable GI  uptake. In addition, due to the avoidance of the first-pass  metabolism and avoidance of inefficient  drug absorption  through the gut, Sublingual drug uptake may improve drug  bioavailability. It is therefore advantageous for a drug to be  delivered through the mucus membranes of the oral cavity,  (e.g., via the Sublingual route), when rapid onset, consistent  T, and C. are advantageous.   In carrying out oral transmucosal drug delivery, the drug is  absorbed through the epithelial membranes of the oral cavity.  However, frequently the key risk associated with oral trans  mucosal delivery is the enhanced potential for Swallowing the  medication owing to the continuous generation, backward  flow and swallowing of the saliva. This becomes a particular  risk when the used dosage forms are large, thereby producing  increased saliva response, which, in turn, leads to increased  Swallowing and removal of the dosage form from the oral  mucosa. The present invention provides the advantage that  the formulations have bioadhesive properties which facilitate  adherence to the oral mucosa during administration, thus  minimizing the risk of ingestion and inefficient delivery  potential.   Various Solid dosage forms, such as Sublingual tablets,  troches, lozenges, lozenges-on-a-stick, chewing gums, and  buccal patches, have been used to deliver drugs via the oral  mucosal tissue. Solid dosage forms such as lozenges and   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   2  tablets are commonly used for oral transmucosal delivery of  drugs, e.g., nitroglycerin Sublingual tablets.   Relevant formulations and delivery systems for oral or  buccal administration of pain medication have been previ  ously disclosed, for example, in: U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,698,822;  3,972,995;  3,870,790:  3,444,858;  3,632,743;  4,020,558:  4,229,447; 4,671,953; 4,836,737; and 5,785,989.   U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002016.0043 discloses com  positions and methods of manufacture for dissolvable and  non-dissolvable drug-containing dosage-forms for noninva  sive administration of medications through mucosal tissues  of the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus of a patient.   U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,671,953 and 5,785,989 (Stanley, et al.)  disclose a lozenge-on-a-stick dosage form for transmucosal  drug delivery. Once the appropriate amount of drug is deliv  ered, the patient or caregiver can remove the lozenge, thus,  stopping the drug delivery to prevent overdose.   U.S. Pat. No. 5.296,234 (Hadaway, et al.) discloses a stick  like holder and packaging, including a tamper resistant foil  pouch, for a hardened, Sucrose based matrix containing a  dosage offentanyl citrate affixed to one end of the holder and  a flange to prevent Swallowing of the holder when placed in a  patient's mouth to medicate or pre-medicate the patient.   U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,974,590, 6,764,696, 6,641,838, 6,585,  997, 6,509,036, 6,391,335, 6,350,470, 6,200,604 and US  Patent Publication Nos. 20050176790, 2005O142197 and  20050142198  describe  pharmaceutical  combinations  of  active compounds such as fentanyl and congeners thereof in  combination with an effervescent agent used as penetration  enhancer to influence the permeability of the active com  pound across the buccal, Sublingual, and gingival mucosa.   U.S. Pat. No. 6,761,910 and U.S. Patent Publication No.  20040213855 disclose pharmaceutical compositions for the  treatment of acute disorders by Sublingual administration of  an essentially water-free, ordered mixture of microparticles  with at least one pharmaceutically active agent adhered to the  surfaces of the carrier particles by way of a bioadhesion  and/or mucoadhesion promoting agent.   U.S. Pat. No. 6,759,059 discloses compositions and meth  ods for the treatment of acute pain by Sublingual administra  tion of compositions which contain from 0.05 to 20 mg fen  tanyl or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the form  of microparticles which are adhered to the surface of carrier  particles by way of a bioadhesion and/or mucoadhesion pro  moting agent, wherein each tablet is approximately 100 mg in  S17C.   U.S. Pat.  No. 5,800,832 and U.S. Pat.  No. 6,159,498  (Tapolsky,  et  al.),  and  U.S.  Patent  Publication  Nos.  20030194420 and 200500 13845 disclose a water soluble,  biodegradable drug delivery device, e.g., a bilayer film disk  having an adhesive layer and a backing layer, both water  soluble, which adheres to mucosal Surfaces.   U.S. Pat.  No.  6.252,981  (Zhang et al.)  discloses oral  mucosal drug delivery as an alternative method of systemic  drug delivery formulation and method for oral transmucosal  delivery of a pharmaceutical. The invention provides a drug  formulation comprising a solid pharmaceutical agent in Solid  Solution with a dissolution agent in Solid form, yielding a  solid solution. The formulation can be used with a variety of  oral transmucosal delivery dosage forms, such as a tablet,  lozenge, lozenge on a stick, chewing gum, and buccal or  mucosal patch. See, also Zhang et al., Clin Pharmacokinet.  2002:41 (9):661-80.   Although various oral mucosal drug delivery systems have  been described, there remains a need for improved formula  tions for use in an oral transmucosal dosage form that allows  for sustained drug delivery of the dosage form, and the ability   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   3  to manipulate and control the drug dissolution kinetics.

The term \u201cmucosal membrane' refers generally to any of  the mucus-coated biological membranes in the body. Absorp  tion through the mucosal membranes of the oral cavity is of  particular interest. Thus, buccal, Sublingual, gingival and  palatal  absorption  are  specifically  contemplated  by  the  present invention. In a preferred embodiment, the penetration  enhancers of the present invention are used to  improve  absorption through those oral tissues which most resemble  the skin in their cellular structure, i.e. the gingiva and palate.   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   7  The term \u201ctransmucosal  delivery of a drug and the like is  meant to encompass all forms of delivery across or through a  mucosal membrane. In particular, \"oral transmucosal  deliv  ery of a drug includes delivery across any tissue of the mouth,  pharynx, larynx, trachea, or upper gastrointestinal tract, par  ticularly  including  the  Sublingual,  gingival  and  palatal  mucosal tissues.   The terms \"oral dosage form\u201d, \u201coral transmucosal dosage  form' and \u201cdissolvable dosage form' may be used inter  changeably herein and refer to a dosage form for use in  practicing the present invention, which comprises a drug  formulation as described herein. The oral dosage form is  typically a 'sublingual dosage form', but in some cases other  oral transmucosal routes may be employed. The invention  relies upon Such oral dosage forms to provide Sustained deliv  ery of drugs across the oral mucosa; by controlling the for  mulation  design  immediate,  intermediate  and  Sustained  release of drugs can be achieved, as described below. The  dosage form is a Substantially homogeneous composition  which comprises active ingredients and one or more of  mucoadhesives (also referred to herein as \u201cbioadhesives')  that provide for adherence to the mucosa of the mouth of a  patient, binders for binding the excipients in a single tablet,  one or more hydrogel-forming excipients, one or more bulk  ing agents, one or more lubricants, as well as other excipients  and factors that affect dissolution time or drug stability. The  dissolvable drug formulations of the invention are neither  effervescent nor do they comprise an essentially water-free,  ordered mixture of microparticles of drug adhered to the  surface of carrier particles, where the carrier particles are  Substantially larger than the microparticles of drug. In one  aspect, the present invention provides small-volume oral  transmucosal drug delivery dosage forms.   The term \u201cnon-ordered particulate mixture' or \u201cnon-or  dered mixture' is used herein with reference to a formulation  of the invention where the mixture is not ordered with respect  to the pharmaceutically active agent and the bioadhesive  material or bioadhesion promoting agent, or other formula  tion components. In addition, the term is used herein with  reference to any formulation prepared by a process that  involves dry mixing wherein drug particles are not uniformly  distributed over the surface of larger carrier particles. Such  non-ordered mixing may involve dry mixing of particles in  a non-ordered fashion, where there is no requirement with  respect to the order of addition/mixing of specific excipients  with the drug, bioadhesive material or bioadhesion promoting  agent and/or disintegrants. Further in the non-ordered mixing  process, there is no limitation on the size of the drug particles.  The drug particles may be larger than 25 um. In addition, a  \u201cnon-ordered mixture' includes any mixing processes in  which the primary carrier particles do not incorporate a dis  integrant within. Finally the \u201cnon-ordered mixture' may be  prepared by any  wet mixing  processes, i.e. processes in  which a solvent or non-solvent is added during the mixing  process or any mixing process in which the drug is added in a  Solution or Suspension form.   The term \"oral transmucosal drug delivery\u201d as used herein  refers to delivery substantially via the oral transmucosal route  and not via swallowing followed by GI absorption. This  includes delivery via the buccal, Sublingual or gum transmu  cosal areas. The formulations of the current invention are  designed to provide for a drug dissolution rate that allows for  maximal delivery via the oral mucosa, and also provides  Sustained delivery rates across the oral mucosa via placement  of the dosage form within transmucosal cavity.   As used herein, \u201csublingual, means literally \u201cunder the  tongue\u2019 and refers to a method of administering Substances   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   8  via the mouth in Such a way that the Substances are rapidly  absorbed via the blood vessels under the tongue rather than  via the digestive tract. Among the various transmucosal sites,  the mucosa of the sublingual cavity is found to be the most  convenient and easily accessible site for the delivery of thera  peutic agents for both local and systemic delivery as Sustained  release dosage forms because it of its abundant vasculariza  tion. Direct access to the systemic circulation through the  internal jugular vein bypasses the hepatic first pass metabo  lism leading to high bioavailability. Further, owing to the  highly vascularized nature of the Sublingual mucosal mem  brane and the reduced number of epithelial cell layers com  pared to other mucosal membranes, absorption of therapeutic  Substances occurs rapidly, thus allowing for direct access to  the systemic circulation and thus enable quick onset of action  while avoiding complications of oral administration.   As used herein, the term \"hydrogel-forming preparation'.  means a Solid formulation largely devoid of water which upon  contact with bodily fluids, and in particular those in the oral  mucosa, is capable of absorbing water in Such a way that it  forms a hydrated gel in situ. The formation of the gel follows  unique disintegration (or erosion) kinetics with Sustained  release of the drug over time, which occurs primarily by  diffusion. Additionally, the term \u201chydrogel-forming prepara  tion  describes a solid formulation largely devoid of water  which upon contact with bodily fluids, and in particular those  in the oral cavity, transforms into a film that releases the drug.  Such films increase the surface area available for drug release  and absorption thus enabling faster absorption of the drug.   The term \u201cdisintegration' is used interchangeably herein  with the term \u201cerosion' and means the physical process by  which a tablet breaks down and pertains to the physical integ  rity of the tablet alone. This can occur in a number of different  ways including breaking into Smaller pieces and ultimately,  fine and large particulates or, alternatively, eroding from the  outside in until the tablet has disappeared.   The term \u201cdissolution\u201d as used herein means the process by  which the active ingredient is dissolved from the tablet in the  presence of a solvent, in vitro, or physiological fluids in Vivo,  e.g., Saliva, irrespective of the mechanism of release, diffu  Sion, erosion or combined erosion and diffusion.   The term \u201cbioadhesion\u201d as used herein refers to the process  of adhesion of the dosage forms to a biological Surface more  in general, including mucosal membranes.   The expression \u201cmucoadhesion' is used herein to refer to  adhesion  to  mucosal  membranes which are covered by  mucus, Such as those in the oral cavity and is used inter  changeably herein with the term \u201cbioadhesion\u201d which refers  to adhesion to any biological Surface.   The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u2019 means an  amount of a therapeutic agent, or a rate of delivery of a  therapeutic agent (e.g., amount over time), effective to facili  tate a desired therapeutic effect, such as pain relief. The  precise desired therapeutic effect (e.g., the degree of pain  relief, and source of the pain relieved, etc.) will vary accord  ing to the condition to be treated, the tolerance of the subject,  the drug and/or drug formulation to be administered (e.g., the  potency of the therapeutic agent (drug), the concentration of  drug in the formulation, and the like), and a variety of other  factors that are appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the  art.   \u201cControlled drug delivery\u201d refers to release or administra  tion of a drug from a given dosage formina controlled fashion  in order to achieve the desired pharmacokinetic profile in  vivo. An aspect of \u201ccontrolled  drug delivery is the ability to  manipulate the formulation and/or dosage form in order to  establish the desired kinetics of drug release.   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   \u201cSustained drug delivery\u201d refers to release or administra  tion of a drug from a given dosage formina Sustained fashion  in order to achieve the desired pharmacokinetic profile in  vivo.   The term \u201cT\u201d as used herein means the time point of   maximum observed plasma concentration.   The term \u201cC.\u201d as used herein  means the maximum   observed plasma concentration.   The term \u201cAUC\u201d as used herein means \u201carea under the  curve' in a plot of concentration of drug in plasma versus  time. AUC is usually given for the time interval Zero to infin  ity, however, clearly plasma drug concentrations cannot be  measured  to  infinity  for  a  patient  so  mathematical  approaches are used to estimate the AUC from a limited  number of concentration measurements. In a practical sense,  the AUC (from Zero to infinity) represents the total amount of  drug absorbed by the body, irrespective of the rate of absorp  tion. This is useful when trying to determine whether two  formulations of the same dose release the same dose of drug  to the body. The AUC of a transmucosal dosage form com  pared to that of the same dosage administered intravenously  serves as the basis for a measurement of bioavailability.   The term \u201cF\u201d as used herein means \u201cpercent bioavailabil  ity' and represents the fraction of drug absorbed from the test  article as compared to the same drug when administered  intravenously. It  is calculated from the AUC  of the test  article following delivery from the intended route versus the  AUC for the same drug after intravenous administration. It is  calculated from the equation: F (%)=AUC  (test article)/  AUC  (intravenous route/article). This is an important term  that establishes the relative fraction of the drug absorbed via  the  test  route (or article)  versus  the  maximum possible  amount absorbed via the intravenous route.   The term \u201cT\u201d as used herein means the observed \u201ctime  of onset' and represents the time required for the plasma drug  concentration to reach 50% of the maximum observed plasma  concentration, C.   The term \u201cTherapeutic Time Ratio\u201d or \u201cTTR  represents  the average time that the drug is present at therapeutic levels,  defined as time within which the drug plasma concentration is  normalized by the drug's  maintained above 50% of C,  elimination half-life and it is calculated by the formula: TTR=  (Time above 50% of C)/(Terminal intravenous elimina  tion half-life of the drug). The last term is obtained from  literature data for the drug of interest in the appropriate spe  cies.   As used herein, when a drug formulation is said to \u201cadhere'  to a surface. Such as a mucosal membrane, it is meant that the  formulation is in contact with said Surface and is retained on  the surface without the application of an external force. Adhe  sion is not meant to imply any particular degree of sticking or  bonding, nor is it meant to imply any degree of permanency.  The term \u201cnon-occlusive' is used herein in its broadest  sense to refer to not trapping or closing the skin to the atmo  sphereby means of a patch device, fixed reservoir, application  chamber, tape, bandage, Sticking plaster, or the like which  remains on the skin at the site of application for a prolonged  length of time.   The term \u201cLog P as used herein means logarithm of the  ratio  of concentrations of un-ionized compound between  octanol and water. It is also called the \"octanol-water partition  coefficient' and serves as a means to identify a chemical  characteristic of a given drug.   II. Oral Transmucosal Drug Delivery Dosage Forms   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   The present invention provides oral transmucosal drug  delivery dosage forms, that produce a reduced salivaresponse   10  when compared with other oral dosage forms, thus providing  high absorption and Sustained absorption rates of the phar  maceutically active Substance across the oral mucosa, and  reduced delivery to the gastrointestinal tract in addition to  offering a more reproducible means of delivery.   The oral dosage form is typically a 'sublingual dosage  form', but in some cases other oral transmucosal routes may  be employed. The invention relies upon Such oral dosage  forms for Sustained delivery of drugs across the oral mucosa.  The dosage form is a Substantially homogeneous composition  which comprises active ingredients and one or more mucoad  hesives (also referred to herein as \u201cbioadhesives\u201d) that pro  vide for adhesion to the mucosa of the mouth of a patient, one  or more binders that provide binding of the excipients in a  single tablet, one or more hydrogel-forming excipients, one  or more bulking agents, one or more lubricants, as well as  other excipients and factors  that modify and control the  drug's dissolution time and kinetics or protect the active from  degradation.   The dosage forms of the invention are adapted for oral  transmucosal (for example Sublingual) delivery of a drug and  typically have an erosion time of from 5 seconds up to a time  selected from 1  minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 5  minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours,  4 hours and 8 hours or longer.   In general, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least  50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at  least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least  95%, at least 98% or at least 99% of the drug in a dosage form  comprising a formulation of the invention is absorbed via the  oral mucosa.   III. Formulations of the Invention   A formulation of the invention is a Substantially homoge  neous  composition  which  comprises  0.01-99%  weight/  weight (w/w), 0.05% to 99%, 0.01% to 50% and 0.1% to 10%  W/w of the active ingredient(s) (drug, medication, etc.) and  one or more of mucoadhesives (also referred to herein as  \u201cbioadhesives\u201d) that provide for adhesion to the mucosa of  the mouth of a patient and may or may not further comprise  one or more of the following: one or more binders that provide  binding of the excipients in a single tablet,  one or more  hydrogel-forming excipients; one or more bulking agents;  one or more lubricants; one or more glidants; one or more  solubilizers; one or more surfactants; one or more flavors; one  or more disintegrants; one or more buffering excipients; one  or more coatings; one or more Sustained release modifiers;  and one or more other excipients and factors that modify and  control the drugs dissolution  or disintegration time and  kinetics or protect the active drug from degradation.   A pharmaceutical dosage form of the invention for oral  transmucosal delivery may be solid or non-solid. In one pre  ferred embodiment, the dosage from is a solid that transforms  into a hydrogel following contact with saliva.  In another  preferred embodiment, the dosage form is a Solid that trans  forms into a bioadhesive film upon contact with saliva.   Excipients include substances added to the formulations of  the invention which are required to produce a quality product,  include, but are not limited to: bulking agents, binders, Sur  factants, bioadhesives, lubricants, disintegrants, stabilizers,  solubilizers, glidants, and additives or factors that affect dis  Solution or disintegration time.   Excipients are not limited to those above. Other suitable  nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for use in oral  formulations can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical  Sciences, 17th Edition, 1985.   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   11  The formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal  drug delivery include at least one bioadhesive (mucoadhe  sive) agent or a mixture of bioadhesives to promote adhesion  to the oral mucosa during drug delivery. In addition, the  bioadhesive agents may also be effective in controlling the  dosage form erosion time and/or, the drug dissolution kinetics  over time when the dosage form is wetted by saliva. In addi  tion, Some of the mucoadhesives named in this invention may  also serve as binders in the formulation to provide necessary  bonding to the dosage form.   Exemplary mucoadhesive or bioadhesive materials, are  selected from the group consisting of natural, synthetic or  biological polymers, lipids,  phospholipids,  and the like.  Examples of natural and/or synthetic polymers include cel  lulosic derivatives (such as methylcellulose, carboxymethyl  cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxyethylmethyl cellu  lose, microcrystalline cellulose, etc), natural gums (such as  guar gum, Xanthan gum, locust bean gum, karayagum, Vee  gum etc), polyacrylates (such as Carbopol, polycarbophil.  etc), alginates, thiol-containing polymers, polyoxyethylenes,  polyethylene glycols (PEG) of all molecular weights (prefer  ably between 1000 and 40,000 Da, of any chemistry, linear or  branched), dextrans of all  molecular weights (preferably  between 1000 and 40,000 Da of any source), block copoly  mers, such as those prepared by combinations of lactic &  glycolic acid (PLA, PGA, PLGA of various  viscosities,  molecular weights and lactic-to-glycolic acid ratios) polyeth  ylene glycol-polypropylene glycol block copolymers of any  number and combination of repeating units (such as Pluron  ics, Tektronix or Genapol block copolymers), combination of  the above copolymers either physically or chemically linked  units (for example PEG-PLA or PEG-PLGA copolymers)  mixtures.  Preferably the bioadhesive material is  selected  from the group of polyethylene glycols, polyoxyethylenes,  polyacrylic acid polymers, such as Carbopols (such as Car  bopol 71G, 934P. 971 P974P) and polycarbophils (such as  Noveon AA-1, Noveon CA-1, Noveon CA-2), cellulose and  its derivatives and most preferably it is polyethylene glycol,  Carbopol, and/or a cellulosic derivative or a combination  thereof.   The  mucoadhesive/bioadhesive  excipient  is  typically  present at 1-50% w/w, preferably 1-40% w/w or most pref  erably between 2-30% w/w. A formulation of the invention  may contain one or more different bioadhesives in any com  bination.   The formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal  drug delivery also include a binder or mixture of two or more  binders which facilitate binding of the excipients into a single  dosage form. Exemplary binders are selected from the group  consisting of cellulosic derivatives (such as methylcellulose,  carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxy  ethylmethyl cellulose, etc), polyacrylates (such as Carbopol,  polycarbophil, etc),  Povidone (all grades), Polyox of any  molecular weight or grade, irradiated or not, starch, polyvi  nylpyrrolidone (PVP), Avicel, and the like.   The binder is typically present at 0.5-60% w/w, preferably   1-30% w/w and most preferably 1.5-15% w/w.   In one embodiment, the formulations of the invention for  oral transmucosal drug delivery also include at least one  hydrogel-forming excipient.  Exemplary hydrogel-forming  excipients are selected from the group consisting of polyeth  ylene glycols and other polymers having an ethylene glycol  backbone,  whether  homopolymers  or  cross-linked  het  eropolymers, block copolymers of ethylene glycol units, such  as polyethylene oxide homopolymers (such as Polyox N10/  MW=100,0001  Polyox-80/MW=200,000;  Polyox  1105/  MW=900,000;  Polyox-301/MW=4,000,000;  Polyox-303/   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   12  MW=7,000,000, Polyox WSR-N-60K, all  of which are  tradenames of Union Carbide), hydroxypropylmethylcelly  lose (HPMC) of all molecular weights and grades, Poloxam  ers (such as Lutrol F-68, Lutrol F-127, F-105 etc, all trade  names of BASF Chemicals), Genapol, polyethylene glycols  (PEG, such as PEG-1500, PEG-3500, PEG-4000, PEG-6000,  PEG-8000, PEG-12000, PEG-20,000, etc.),  natural gums  (Xanthan gum, Locust bean gum, etc) and cellulose deriva  tives (HC, HMC, HMPC, HPC, CP, CMC), polyacrylic acid  based polymers either as free or cross-linked and combina  tions thereof, biodegradable polymers such as poly lactic  acids,  polyglycolic  acids  and any  combination  thereof,  whether a physical blend or cross-linked. In an embodiment,  the hydrogel components may be cross-linked. The hydrogel  forming excipient(s) are typically present at 0.1-70% w/w,  preferably 1-50% w/w or most preferably 1-30% w/w.   The formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal  drug delivery may also include at least one Sustained release  modifier which is a substance that upon hydration of the  dosage form will preferentially interact with the drug in a  physical or molecular level and thus reduce the rate of its  diffusion from the transmucosal dosage form. Such excipi  ents may also reduce the rate of water uptake by the formu  lation and thus enable a more prolonged drug dissolution and  release from the tablet. In one embodiment, such sustained  release modifiers are capable of binding molecularly to the  active via physical (and therefore reversible) interactions,  thus increasing the effective molecular weight of the active  and thus further modifying their permeation (diffusion) char  acteristics through the epithelial and basal membranes of the  sublingual mucosa. Such binding is reversible in nature and  does not involve any chemical modifications of the active,  thus it does not affect in any way its pharmacological action.  In another preferred embodiment, such Sustained release  modifiers upon hydration may form discrete structures that  may spontaneously entrap the drug and thus further prolong  its action. Exemplary Sustained release modifiers are selected  from the group consisting of lipids, phospholipids, Sterols,  Surfactants,  polymers and salts.  In  general, the selected  excipient(s) are lipophilic and capable of naturally form com  plexes with hydrophobic or lipophilic drugs. The degree of  association of the release modifier(s) and the drug can be  varied by altering the modifier-to-drug ratio in the formula  tion.  In  addition,  Such  interaction  may be appropriately  enhanced by the appropriate combination of the release modi  fier with the active drug in the manufacturing process. Alter  natively, the Sustained release modifier may be a charged  polymer either synthetic or biopolymer bearing a net charge,  either positive or negative, and which is capable of binding to  the active via electrostatic interactions thus modifying both  its diffusion through the tablet and/or the kinetics of its per  meation through the mucosal surface. Similarly to the other  compounds mentioned above, such interaction is reversible  and does not involve permanent chemical bonds with the  active.   A Sustained release modifier may typically be present at  0-80% w/w, preferably 1-20% w/w, most preferably 1-10%  wfw.   Such Sustained release modifiers may further create pock  ets or microdomains dispersed throughout the Swollen net  work of the hydrogel. These pockets can serve as reservoirs  for drug compounds, as they will tend to decrease the driving  force for diffusion by reducing the concentration of the drug  solute in the bulk of the hydrogel. The hydrogel matrix along  with the sustained release modifiers may be selected and  designed such that  drug release from the microdomains   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   13  occurs slowly enough to enable the Sustained dissolution of  the drug from the dosage form.   The formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal  drug delivery also include at least one filler (bulking agent).  Exemplary bulking agents are selected from the group con  sisting of lactose USP, Starch 1500, mannitol, sorbitol, mal  todextrin, malitol or other non-reducing Sugars; microcrys  talline cellulose (e.g., Avicel), dibasic calcium phosphate  (anhydrous or dihydrate). Sucrose, etc. and mixtures thereof.  The filler/bulking agent is typically present at 20-95% w/w,  preferably 40-80% w/w.   The formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal  drug delivery may also include at least  one solubilizing  agent(s). Such agents are beneficial to improve the solubility  of the active drug and enhance its absorption characteristics,  but also facilitate handling and manufacturing. Appropriate  solubilizers may include cyclodextrins, pH adjusters, salts  and buffers, Surfactants, fatty acids, phospholipids, metals of  fatty acids etc. Exemplary surfactants are selected from the  group consisting of ionic (Sodium lauryl Sulfate, etc), non  ionic Such as polysorbates (Tween and Span Surfactant series,  Poloxamers, etc.), bile salts (such as Sodium taurocholate,  Sodium taurodeoxycholate, sodium starch glycolate, sodium  glycodeoxycholate, sodium glycocholate, etc), various alkyl  glycosides, fatty acids, phosphatidylcholines, triglycerides,  sphingolipids, glycosylated lipids, PEGylated lipids and mix  tures thereof and may be present at 0.01-5% w/w. Exemplary  metal salts and buffers may include at least of either organic  (acetate, citrate, tartrate, etc) or inorganic (phosphate, car  bonate, bicarbonate, borate, sulfate, sulfite, bisulfite,  met  abisulfite,  chloride, etc.) salts of metals such as Sodium,  potassium, calcium, magnesium, etc), Further, combinations  of one or more of Such salts may be used to ensure adequate  stabilization of the drug in the dosage form and may be  present  in  the  formulation  at  0.1-20%  w/w, preferably  between 1-10% w/w. Exemplary pH adjusters include hydro  chloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, Sodium hydroxide,  ammonium hydroxide and the like and may be present in the  formulation between 0.1-5% w/w.   The formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal  drug delivery also include at least one lubricant. Lubricants  have several functions including preventing the adhesion of  the tablets to the compression equipment and in some cases  improving the flow of the granulation prior to compression or  encapsulation.  Lubricants are in  most cases hydrophobic  materials. Exemplary lubricants are selected from the group  consisting of Stearic acid and divalent cations of Such as  magnesium Stearate, calcium Stearate,  etc.,  talc,  glycerol  monostearate and the like. The lubricant is typically presentat  0.01-10% w/w, preferably between 0.1-3% w/w.   The formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal  drug delivery may also include at least one glidant. Glidants  are substances that improve the flow characteristics of the  blended or granulated material from the hopper into the feed  ing mechanism and ultimately, in the tablet die. Exemplary  glidants are selected from the group comprising colloidal  silicon dioxide, precipitated silicon dioxide, fumed silica  (CAB-O-SIL  M-5P,  trademark  of Cabot  Corporation),  stearowet and sterotex, silicas (such as SILOID and SILOX  silicas\u2014trademarks of Grace Davison Products, Aerosil\u2013  trademark of Degussa Pharma), higher fatty acids, the metal  salts thereof, hydrogenated vegetable oils and the like. The  glidant is  typically present at 0.01-20% w/w, preferably  between 0.1-5% w/w.   The formulation may also contain flavors or Sweeteners  and colorants such as aspartame, mannitol, lactose. Sucrose,  other artificial sweeteners; ferric oxides and FD&C lakes.   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   14  The formulation may also contain additives to help stabi  lize the drug Substance from chemical of physical degrada  tion.  Such degradation reactions  may include oxidation,  hydrolysis,  aggregation,  deamidation,  etc.  Appropriate  excipients that can stabilize the drug Substance may include  anti-oxidants, anti-hydrolytic agents, aggregation-blockers  etc. Anti-oxidants may include BHT, BHA, vitamins, citric  acid, EDTA, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfate, thio  urea,  amino acids  such as  methionine, etc.  Aggregation  blockers may include Surfactants, amino-acids, such as argi  nine, glycine, histidine, methionine etc. Additional excipients  that may help protect the active against degradation are salts,  pH adjusters, chelating agents and buffers in the dry or solu  tion form. A number of salts may include all those known in  the art and may be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical  Sciences,  17th  Edition,  1985.  Exemplary  pH adjusters  include  hydrochloric  acid,  acetic  acid,  phosphoric  acid,  Sodium  hydroxide,  ammonium hydroxide and the  like.  Examples of such chelating agents include polylysine of dif  ferent molecular weights, disodium edetate, Sodium citrate,  condensed sodium phosphate and the like. Examples of salts  and buffers may include at least of either organic (acetate,  citrate,  tartrate,  etc)  or inorganic  (phosphate,  carbonate,  bicarbonate, borate, sulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, metabisulfite,  chloride, etc.) salts of metals such as Sodium, potassium,  calcium, magnesium, etc), Further, combinations of one or  more of Such salts may be used to ensure adequate stabiliza  tion of the drug in the dosage form. Stabilizing excipients  may be present at 0.01-15% w/w in the formulation, prefer  ably between 0.1-5% w/w.   The formulation may also contain Surfactants to increase  wetting of the tablet, especially if faster release kinetics are  desired, which can result in faster initiation of mucoadhesion.  Such surfactants are generally present from 0.01  to 3%  weight percent of the composition. Exemplary Surfactants are  selected from the group consisting of ionic (Sodium lauryl  Sulfate, etc), non-ionic Such as polysorbates (Tween and Span  Surfactant series), bile salts (such as Sodium taurocholate,  Sodium  taurodeoxycholate,  Sodium  glycodeoxycholate,  Sodium glycocholate, etc),  various alkyl glycosides, fatty  acids,  phosphatidylcholines,  triglycerides,  sphingolipids,  glycosylated lipids, PEGylated lipids and mixtures thereof.  A dosage form of the invention may additionally comprise  one or more excipients that may affect both tablet disintegra  tion kinetics and drug release from the tablet, and thus phar  macokinetics. Such disintegrants are known to those skilled  in the art and may be selected from a group consisting of  starch, carboxy-methycellulose type or crosslinked Polyvinyl  Pyrrolidone (such as cross-povidone, PVP-XL), alginates,  cellulose-based  disintegrants  (such  as  purified  cellulose,  methylcellulose, crosslinked sodium carboxy methylcellu  lose (Ac-Di-Sol) and carboxy methyl cellulose), low substi  tuted hydroxypropyl ethers of cellulose, microcrystalline cel  lulose  (Such  as  Avicel),  ion  exchange  resins  (such  as  Ambrelite IPR 88), gums (such as agar, locust bean, karaya,  Pectin and tragacanth), guar gums, gum Karaya, chitin and  chitosan, Smecta, gellan gum, Isapghula Husk, Polacrillin  Potassium (Tulsion), gas-evolving disintegrants (such as  citric acid and tartaric acid along with the Sodium bicarbon  ate, Sodium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate or calcium car  bonate), Sodium starch glycolate (such as Explotab and Pri  mogel), starch DC and the likes. Addition of such additives  facilitates the fast disintegration (or erosion) of the tablet into  smaller pieces that erode more rapidly. An additional benefit  of inclusion of Such disintegrants in the formulations of the  present invention, is that the Smaller, drug-containing par  ticles formed upon disintegration have, by virtue of the highly   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   15  increased surface area of contact with the oral mucosa, Supe  rior bioadhesive properties. In addition, the increased surface  area may further facilitate the fast release of the active sub  stance and thus further accelerate drug absorption and attain  ment of the required therapeutic levels systemically. How  ever, as described above, such disintegrants are used at a low  % w/w level in the solid dosage form, typically 1-30% w/w  relative to the total weight of the dosage unit, preferably  5-25% W/w.   In one aspect of the invention, the dosage forms may com  prise one or more biodegradable polymers of any type useful  for Sustained drug release. Exemplary polymer compositions  include polyanhydrides and co-polymers of lactic acid and  glycolic acid, poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), poly  (lactic acid) (PLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), polyorthoe  sters, proteins, and polysaccharides.   One method of making a formulation of the invention  includes the steps of weighing the drug and one or more of  bioadhesives, binders, hydrogel forming excipients, bulking  agents, lubricants or glidants and factors that affect dissolu  tion time, possibly powder grinding, dry powder mixing and  tableting via direct compression. Alternatively, a wet granu  lation process may be used. Such a method (Such as high  shear granulation process) involves mixing the active drug  and possibly some excipients in a mixer. The binder may be  added in the mix dry or dissolved in the fluid used for granu  lation. The granulating solution or Suspension is added to the  dry powders in the mixer and mixed until the desired charac  teristics are achieved. This usually produces granules of suit  able  characteristics  for  producing  dosage  forms  with  adequate dissolution time,  content uniformity, and other  physical characteristics. After the wet granulation step, the  product is most often dried and/or then milled after drying to  get a major percentage of the product within a desired size  range. Sometimes, the product is dried after being wet-sized  using a Suitable device, such as an oscillating granulator or a  mill. The dry granulation mix may then processed to get an  acceptable size range by first screening with a sieving device,  and then milling the oversized particles. In some instances, an  appropriate glidant is added to improve the flow properties of  the granules; Suitable glidants, as described above.   A formulation of the invention may be manufactured by  alternative granulation processes, all known to those skilled  in the art, such as spray fluid bed granulation, extrusion and  spheronization or fluid bed rotor granulation.   A bioadhesive tablet may be made using a formulation of  the invention by coating a primary tablet with Suitable coat  ings known in the art. Such coatings are meant to protect the  active cores against damage (abrasion, breakage, dust forma  tion) against influences to which the cores are exposed during  transport and storage (atmospheric humidity, temperature  fluctuations), and naturally these film coatings can also be  colored. The sealing effect offilm coats against water vaporis  expressed by the water vapor permeability. Coating may be  performed by one of the well known processes such as  Wu\u0308rster coating, dry coating, film coating, fluid bed coating,  pan coating, etc. Typical coating materials include polyvinyl  pyrrolidone  (PVP),  polyvinyl  pyrrolidone  vinyl  acetate  copolymer (PVPVA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl  alcohol/polyethylene glycol copolymer (PVA/PEG), gellan  gum, maltodextrin, methyl cellulose, hydroxyl propyl methyl  cellulose (HPMC of all grades and molecular weights), car  rageenan and the like.   In one embodiment, the tablet core of the present invention  may be coated with a bioadhesive material. Such as those  defined above, to improve bioadhesion of the tablet in the  Sublingual cavity. In Such design, an eroding or hydrogel core   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   16  is  designed and coated with the appropriate bioadhesive  material, thus creating a design Such as that shown in FIG. 1.  To further facilitate the process, appropriate disintegrants  may be included in the core, as described above.   In another embodiment, the tablet core of the present  invention may be coated with a moisture-resistant coating,  Such as a hydrophobic polymers, including celluloses, etc., to  create a barrier for moisture ingress in the tablet core and thus  further protect moisture-sensitive drugs. In addition, Such  water-resistant coat may improve the tablet behavior during  manufacture by reducing its growth upon exposure to high%  RH (relative humidity) environments, etc. A number of coat  ing materials can be used to improve the moisture resistance  of the tablet such as EUDRAGITR) E PO, Opadry(RAMB,  starch acetate and the like. Of particular interest in this appli  cation are coating materials that have very limited water  uptake in <85% RH, yet rapidly absorb water at >85% RH.  Such a function would facilitate wetting of the dosage form in  the Sublingual environment yet protect the dosage form under  typical storage and moderate % RH conditions.   It will be understood that the formulation will be converted  into a dosage form for delivery to a Subject using procedures  routinely employed by those of skill in the art. The process for  preparation of the dosage form is  optimized in  order to  achieve high dose content uniformity, which is particularly  important for the potent compounds, which are generally  present in mass ratios of 0.01-10% w/w.   Many methods of making dosage forms for use in the  invention are known in the art and may be employed in  practicing the present invention, Such as direct compression,  wet granulation, etc. In preparing a small tablet, Such as a  NanoTab(R), it has been shown that erosion time and adhesion  are independent of tableting force between 2-500K psi.   The dosage forms of the invention are adapted to adhere to  the oral mucosa during the period of drug delivery, and until  most or all of the drug has been delivered from the dosage  form via the oral mucosa.   The dosage  form  of the  current  invention  is  further  designed to enable Sustained disintegration of the dosage over  a time period after application in an oral mucosal cavity in  vivo. The dosage forms of this invention may be designed to  erode within 30 seconds-8 hours after administration. Fur  ther, they are designed to provide a range of disintegration  rates, from linear to biphasic over the entire duration of the  process.   In addition, the oral transmucosal dosage forms of this  invention are designed to Sustain and control the release (dis  Solution) of the drug from the dosage form after application to  the oral mucosa in vivo or in vitro. The drug dissolution from  these Sustained-release transmucosal dosage forms can fol  low first or second order dissolution kinetics which can be  manipulated to achieve the optimal in vivo pharmacokinetic  profile and pharmacological action.   In certain embodiments of the invention, the drug dosage  form is adapted to deliver 30% or more of the total amount of  drug contained in a single drug dosage form to an individual  via the oral mucosa. In other embodiments the percentage of  the total amount of drug contained in a single drug dosage  delivered  transmucosally  may be  greater  than  30-40%.  40-50%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-90% and preferably greater  than 95%. In exemplary embodiments, at least 35%, 40%,  45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%,  95%, 98% or 99%, of the total amount of drug contained in a  single drug dosage form is delivered via the oral mucosa.   In certain embodiments of the invention, the drug dosage  form is adapted to deliver no more than 60% of the total  amount of drug contained in a single drug dosage form to an   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   17  individual via the GI tract. In other embodiments the percent  age delivered via the GI tract maybe lower, such that not more  than 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5% or 1% of the total  amount of drug contained in the drug dosage form is delivered  to the individual via the GI tract.   The delivery of a greater percentage (and amount) of drug  via the oral mucosa and the corresponding lack of delivery via  the GI tract provides a significant improvement over prior  methods of drug delivery.   One preferred site for drug delivery is the sublingual area,  although in certain embodiments it may be advantageous for  the dosage form to be placed inside the cheek, or to adhere to  the roof of the mouth or the gum.   Minimizing the saliva response produces a delivery profile  that is consistent and predictable from patient to patient,  which is  not the case with oral lozenge formulations that  produce a significant  saliva  response.  A reduced saliva  response is particularly important for drugs with poor bio  availability through the GI tract.   Sublingual delivery is preferred as the Sublingual mucosa  is more readily permeable to medications than other mucosal  areas, such as the buccal mucosa, resulting in more rapid  uptake (Shojaei A. H. et al. Buccal mucosa as a route for  systemic drug delivery: a review. Journal of Pharmacy and  Pharmaceutical Sciences. 1:15-30, 1998).   The formulations of the invention also provide improved  dissolution profiles over previous oral or oral transmucosal  formulations,  efficacious  delivery  of drug  via  the  oral  mucosa, and a consistent plasma level within the therapeutic  window.   The decreased Swallowing of drug and more consistent  uptake of oral transmucosal dosage forms made using the  formulations of the present invention result in peak plasma  levels that are more consistent between individual dosages as  compared to those using commercially available formula  tions.   Dosage forms comprising a formulation of the present  invention are designed to work effectively in the unique envi  ronment of the oral cavity such that a limited amount of fluid,  the relatively short period of time for drug delivery, and the  pH levels within the oral cavity do not adversely affect  absorption of the drug. The formulations are also designed to  improve dissolution, solubility, and stability of the drug dos  age form. The advantages of the present invention contribute  to the ability of the drug formulation to provide higher levels  of drug absorption via the oral transmucosal route and con  sistent dose-to-effect times, making the present formulation a  significant improvement for the treatment of acute or break  through pain.   The formulations of the present invention are designed to  avoid the high peak plasma levels of immediate-release liquid  formulations by controlling both tablet disintegration (or ero  sion) and drug dissolution and release from the tablet to  enable more consistent delivery. The formulations of the  present invention may be used to provide single or individual,  repetitive doses that include a defined amount of the active  agent, thereby allowing the patient to accurately titrate the  amount of drug delivered and to adjust the amount as appro  priate in a safe and effective manner.   The advantage of the Sustained-release oral transmucosal  formulations described in this invention is that they can main  tain the plasma drug concentration within a targeted thera  peutic window for a longer duration than immediate release  formulations, whether Solid dosage forms or liquid-based  dosage forms. The high peak plasma levels typically observed  for Such conventional immediate release formulations are  blunted by the sustained release of the drug. In addition, a   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   18  rapid decline in plasma levels is avoided since the drug will  continually cross through the oral cavity into the systemic  circulation during the entire process of tablet dissolution, thus  providing plasma pharmacokinetics with a more stable pla  teau. In addition, the dosage forms described in this invention  may improve treatment safety by minimizing the potentially  deleterious side effects due to the reduction of the peaks and  troughs in the plasma drug pharmacokinetics, which compro  mise treatment safety.   The oral transmucosal bioadhesive formulations of the  present invention are typically designed to disintegrate (or  totally erode) from within 30 seconds up to  1  minute, 2  minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15  minutes, 30 minutes, 1  hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours or  longer dependent upon the patient and circumstances of drug  administration as well as the intrinsic drug pharmacokinetics.  It will be understood that the composition of the oral trans  mucosal  formulations  of the  present  invention  may be  adjusted to provide both a range of doses and a range of  dissolution times to fit particular clinical situations.   Dissolution times for sublingual administration of the for  mulations of the invention will vary from 30 seconds up to 1  minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 min  utes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours  or longer.   The oral  transmucosal dosage forms of invention are  designed to fit comfortably under the tongue such that the  drug form disintegrates Sufficiently slowly to avoid the imme  diate peak plasma levels followed by significant drop off seen  in prior art formulations such as described in U.S. Pat. No.  6,759,059, wherein fentanyl was administered via tablets  containing 400 ug offentanyl which resulted in a peak plasma  level of 2.5 ng/ml at 5 minutes post-administration, followed  by an immediate drop in plasma level.   The formulations of the present invention will be provided  in a number of dosage forms that vary according to the nature  and amount of active ingredients while maintaining the fea  tures of the formulations of the invention for dissolution in the  oral cavity Such that a greater percentage of drug absorption  takes place via the oral mucosal route and not the GI route.  In one aspect of the invention, when a homogeneous dos  age form comprising a formulation according to the present  invention is placed in the Sublingual cavity, preferably under  the tongue on either side of the frenulum linguae, where it  adheres upon contact. While not wishing to be bound by  theory, it appears that when a dosage form comprising a  formulation of the invention is exposed to the moisture of the  Sublingual space the dosage form absorbs water, resulting in  the formation of a hydrogel network. In a preferred embodi  ment, the hydrogel formulation is designed to form a film  which is visible in the sublingual space following tablet dis  integration. Upon placement on the oral mucosa, the dosage  form absorbs water such that upon full hydration, it spreads  across the mucosal Surface, thus transforming into a bioad  hesive film containing the active drug. This transformation  results in a significant increase of the Surface area available  for drug release, thus accelerating drug diffusion and release  from the dosage form.   Hydrogel formation in the dosage forms of the invention  takes place in the presence of certain hydrogel-enabling  excipients that have the capacity to absorb water and form  gels. Such excipients include Polyox of all grades, polyeth  ylene  glycols  (of  all  grades),  PEG-based  copolymers,  whether homopolymers or heteropolymers (such as Polox  amer, etc), Dextran, HPMC, starch, etc., as detailed above. In  addition, any combination of Such excipients  may favor  hydrogel formation upon contact with bodily fluids.  In a   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   19  certain embodiment of the present invention, combinations of  Such hydrogel forming excipients with excipients that do not  favor gel formation (i.e., don\u2019t have Such a capacity to Swell),  e.g., certain celluloses and the like also result in formation of  hydrogel structures, albeit with a lower gelling capacity.   In another aspect of the invention, dosage forms referred to  herein as \"eroding-type' dosage forms are provided. Such  \"eroding-type' dosage forms, although they may absorb sig  nificant amounts of water (depending on their composition)  they do not have the same capacity of Swelling and do not  form gels as described for the hydrogel type formulations  defined above. These \u201ceroding-type' formulations adhere to  the Sublingual cavity upon contact, similar to the hydrogel  formulations. However, in contrast to hydrogels, they follow  a Surface-erosion mechanism without prior formation of a  hydrated gel. As an \"eroding-type' dosage form is exposed to  the moisture of the sublingual space, the surface of the tablet  hydrates and erodes thereby exposing the underlying layers;  as the Subsequent layers become hydrated they Subsequently  erode and so on, thus resulting in a continuous reduction in  the size of the tablet.   In a preferred embodiment, such eroding formulations are  designed to form a film which is visible in the sublingual  space following tablet disintegration. Upon placement on the  oral mucosa, the dosage form absorbs water Such that upon  full hydration, it spreads across the mucosal Surface, thus  transforming into a bioadhesive film containing the active  drug. This transformation results in a significant increase of  the Surface area available for drug release, thus accelerating  drug diffusion and release from the dosage form. Owing to the  higher contact surface area, drug absorption occurs fast,  resulting in fast onset of action.   Such eroding-type dosage forms are typically character  ized by a lack of inclusion of hydrogel-forming excipients  and in particular Polyox (of all grades) PEG-based copoly  mers, whether homopolymers or heteropolymers (such as  Poloxamer, etc), HPMC, etc. However, it will be understood  that the percentage w/w composition of the various compo  nents of the dosage form will impact the mechanism of ero  Sion.  For example, Small amounts of particular hydrogel  enabling excipients may not induce formation of a hydrogel  and as  Such, some hydrogel-enabling excipients may be  included in eroding formulations without changing their ero  Sion-based disintegration mechanism. It is both the combina  tion of excipients and their percent weight composition that  gives a hydrogel its capacity to maintain a structural matrix  upon contact with an aqueous Solution. Therefore, inclusion  of a hydrogel-forming excipient in a given formulation will  not necessarily induce \u201cswelling as with the typical hydrogel  formulations. Both hydrogel-forming and eroding-type for  mulations of the invention provide control of the drug disso  lution and/or in vivo absorption kinetics to enable enhanced  bioavailability and improved efficacy.   The formulations of the invention find particular utility in  pediatric  applications,  since the  comfortable and secure  nature of the dosage form will allow small children to readily  accept this mode of therapy and will reliably deliver drug  transmucosally. Specific examples include, but are not lim  ited to, treatment ofpediatric acute pain when IV access is not  available or inconvenient, treatment ofpediatric asthma when  the child is notable to use an inhaled route of administration  effectively, treatment of nausea when a child can not or will  not Swallow a pill, pre-procedural sedation when a child is  NPO (no oral  intake allowed) or a  more rapid onset is  required.   Similarly, the formulations of the invention find particular  utility in geriatric applications, since the comfortable and   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   20  secure nature of the dosage form will allow elderly patients to  readily accept this mode of therapy and will reliably deliver  drug transmucosally. Specific examples include, but are not  limited to, treatment of nausea when a elderly patient can't  Swallow a pill, acute pain when IV access is not available or  inconvenient, pre-procedural sedation when a child is NPO  (no oral intake allowed) or a more rapid onset is required, etc.  The formulations of the invention find further utility in  Veterinary applications. Specific examples include, but are  not limited to, any treatment of an acute condition for which  IV administration is not readily available or inconvenient,  Such as pain relief, anxiety/stress relief, pre-procedural seda  tion, etc.   IV. Pharmaceutically Active Agents for Use in  Formulations of the Inventions   In one embodiment of the invention, a formulation of the  invention finds utility in delivery of any drug which can be  formulated in a dosage form comprising a bioadhesive mate  rial and a predetermined amount of a pharmaceutically active  agent in an amount selected from the group consisting of 10  Jug. 15 Jug. 25 Jug, 50 Lig, 100 Lig. 500 Lig, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg. 4  mg, 5 mg, 6 mg, 7 mg, 8 mg, 9 mg and 10 mg.

In yet another embodiment of the invention, a formulation  of the invention finds utility in delivery of any drug which can  be formulated in a dosage form wherein a single or repeated  oral transmucosal administration to a subject results in a T.  of from about 5 minutes to about 2 hours.   In yet another embodiment of the invention, a formulation  of the invention finds utility in delivery of any drug which can  be formulated in a dosage form wherein a single or repeated  oral transmucosal administration to a Subject results in a  plasma level that reaches 50% of C  in a time selected from  about 3 minutes to 2 hours, from about 3 minutes to 30  minutes, from about 3 minutes to 20 minutes and from about  3 minutes to 10 minutes.   In yet another embodiment of the invention, a formulation  of the invention finds utility in delivery of any drug which can   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   21  be formulated in a dosage form wherein a single or repeated  oral transmucosal administration to a Subject results in a  plasma half-life of from about 5 minutes and about 6 hours.  In yet another embodiment of the invention, a formulation  of the invention finds utility in delivery of any drug which can  be formulated in a dosage form wherein a single or repeated  oral transmucosal administration to a Subject results in a  therapeutic time ratio of greater than 0.07 or from about 0.5 to  about 2.0.

In yet another embodiment of the invention, a formulation  of the invention can be delivered by appropriate single or  multiple dose applicators or a device. Such applicators are  capable of enabling accurate placement of the dosage forms  of the present invention in the oral transmucosal cavity, and  preferably the sublingual area.   Pharmaceutically active agents for use in a formulation of  the invention are characterized by logarithm of the octanol  water partition coefficient (Log P) between 0.006 and 3.382.  Formulations of the Invention for Suppression or Mitiga   tion of Pain.   10   15   In one exemplary application, the formulations of the  invention find utility in treating a subject Suffering from pain  that may be associated with any of a variety of identifiable or  unidentifiable etiologies. The formulations of the invention  find utility in Suppression or mitigation of pain. The term  \u201ctreatment\u2019 or \u201cmanagement  of pain is used here to gener  ally describe regression, Suppression, or mitigation of pain so  as to make the subject more comfortable, as determined for  example by pain score.   The term \u201cacute pain' is used herein with reference to pain  that is typically present for less than one month, however, in  Some cases pain that, is present for as long as three months  may also be considered to be \u201cacute\u201d.   The term \"chronic pain' is used herein with reference to   pain that is typically present for longer than one month.   In one exemplary aspect, the invention relates to oral trans  mucosal delivery of a formulation for pain-relief comprising  a drug such as an opioid or opioidagonist, for the treatment of  acute or break-through pain.   The active agent in Such formulations may include Sufen  tanil, or a Sufentanil congener Such as alfentanil, fentanyl.  lofentanil, carfentanil, remifentanil, trefentanil, or mirfenta  nil.  One preferred embodiment utilizes  sufentanil as the  active agent. Another preferred embodiment utilizes fentanyl  as the active agent. Other preferred embodiments utilize  alfentanil, lofentanil, carfentanil, remifentanil, trefentanil, or  mirfentanilas the active agent. Yet another preferred embodi  ment utilizes a combination of Sufentanil and at least one  additional agent for treatment of analgesia as the active agent.  In alternative embodiments, a formulation of the invention  includes a combination of two or more opioid analogues. Such  as Sufentanil plus an opioid such as fentanyl, alfentanil,  trefentanil, mirfentanil or remifentanil. Various opioid drugs  have different pharmacokinetic profiles and different interac  tions with mu opioid receptor splice variants and, therefore,  may be used in combination to enhance the therapeutic effect.  For example, sufentanil combined with fentanyl may have a  rapid onset due to the sufentanil with a slower loss of anal  gesia due to the fentanyl.   In alternative embodiments, the drug dosage form of the  invention may include at least one opioid drug and one or  more other drugs wherein the other drug may be an opioid or  non-opioid drug. The oral transmucosal drug delivery formu  lations are useful for delivery of any active drug compound   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   22  and treatment of any condition wherein the active drug com  pound may be delivered via the oral mucosal route.   The formulation of the invention may contain a highly  potent opioid, Such as Sufentanil, fentanyl or a Sufentanil  congener.   In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, each dos  age form contains from about 0.25 to about 200 ug of Sufen  tanil,  in combination with one or more other therapeutic  agents or drugs.   In yet another example of the invention, each dosage form  contains from about 2 to about 1500 g offentanyl, in com  bination with one or more other therapeutic agents or drugs.  In some embodiments, the oral dosage formulations of the  invention include an opioid antagonist, Such as naloxone. In  Such embodiments, naloxone is provided in an appropriate  concentration to inhibit activity of the opioid component of  the formulation were it to be injected.   The invention finds utility in the treatment of both opioid   naive patients and opioid tolerant patients.   The term \u201copioid naive patient' is used herein with refer  ence to a patient who has not received repeated administration  of an opioid substance over a period of weeks to months.   The term \u201copioid tolerant patient\u2019 as used herein means a  physiological state characterized by a decrease in the effects  of an opioid substance (e.g., analgesia, nausea or sedation)  with chronic administration. An opioid Substance is a drug,  hormone, or other chemical Substance that has analgesic,  sedative and/or narcotic effects similar to those containing  opium or its derivatives. If analgesic tolerance develops, the  dose of opioid substance is increased to result in the same  level of analgesia. This tolerance may not extend to side  effects and side effects may not be well tolerated as the dose  is increased.   In certain embodiments, a dosage form comprising a for  mulation of the invention contains at least 0.001% percent by  weight of the active ingredient. Preferably, the dosage form  comprises from about at least 0.005% to as much as 99.9% by  weight, 0.05% to 99%, 0.01% to 50%, 0.1% to 10% of the  active ingredient. In certain other embodiments, a dosage  form comprising a formulation of the invention contains as  much as 10 ug, 15 Jug, 25 Jug, 50 Lig, 100 ug, 500 ug, 1  mg, 2  mg, 3 mg, 4 mg, 5 mg, 6 mg, 7 mg. 8 mg.9 mg or 10 mg of the  active ingredient or drug.   The percentage of active ingredient(s) will vary dependent  upon the size of the dosage form and nature of the active  ingredient(s), optimized to obtain maximal delivery via the  oral mucosal route. In some aspects of the invention more  than one active ingredient may be included in a single dosage  form   In one exemplary embodiment, a dosage form for use in the  treatment of pain may comprise from about 0.25 to about 200  ug of sufentanil, from about 2.5 to about 100g of sufentanil,  from about 2.5 to about 40 g of sufentanil, from about 2.5 to  about 15.0 ug of sufentanil, from about 2.0 to about 1500 g  offentanyl, from about 50 to about 1500 ug offentanyl, or  from about 200 to about 1500 lug offentanyl.   In various embodiments, the formulation of the present  invention generally provides appropriate pain relief in all  types of patients including children, and adults of all ages  who are opioid tolerant or naive. The invention finds utility in  both the in-patient and out-patient setting.   The clinical use of sufentanil has predominantly been lim  ited to IV administration in operating rooms or intensive care  units. As further described herein, there have been a few  studies on the use of liquid Sufentanil preparations for low  dose intranasal administration and a case report of sublingual  delivery of a liquid Sufentanil preparation. In most of these   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   23  studies, the Smallest dosing of Sufentanil in adults was 5ug in  opioid naive patients. Intranasal bioavailability was approxi  mately 75% of that obtained by IV, however no pharmacoki  netic data has been published on the Sublingual use of Sufen  tanil.   The bioadhesive transmucosal formulations of the inven  tion contain from about 0.25 to about 200g of sufentanil per  dosage form for oral transmucosal delivery. As will be under  stood by those of skill in the art, the dose will be on the low  end of the range for children and the high end of the range for  adults dependent upon body mass, in particular when admin  istered long-term to opioid-tolerant adults. Small-volume  oral transmucosal drug delivery dosage forms of Sufentanil  have not been described.   Exemplary formulations of the invention for administra  tion to children (pediatric patients) contain from about 0.25 to  about 120 ug of Sufentanil per dosage form. For example, a  formulation of the invention for administration to children  may contain about 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 40,  60 or 120 ug of sufentanil for oral transmucosal delivery. It  follows that for pediatric patients, an exemplary dose range is  from at least about 0.02  g/kg to about 0.5 ug/kg with a  preferable range of from about 0.05 to about 0.1  g/kg.   Exemplary formulations of the invention for administra  tion to adults contain from about 2.5 to about 200 lug of  Sufentanil per dosage form. For example, a formulation of the  invention for administration to adults may contain about 2.5,  3, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 180 or 200 ug  or more of sufentanil for oral transmucosal delivery.   The dosage forms of the invention contain from about 2 to  about 1500 ug offentanyl per dosage form for oral transmu  cosal delivery. As will be understood by those of skill in the  art, the dose will be on the low end of the range for children  and the high end of the range for adults dependent upon body  mass, in particular when administered long term to opioid  tolerant adults.   Exemplary dosage forms of the invention for administra  tion to children (pediatric patients) contain from about 2 to  about 900 ug offentanyl per dosage form. For example, a  dosage form of the invention for administration to children  may contain about 2, 3.75, 7.5, 18.75, 30, 37.5, 45, 60, 75,  112.5, 150, 300, 450 or 900 ug offentanyl for oral transmu  cosal delivery.   Exemplary dosage forms of the invention for administra  tion to adults contain from about 18.75 to about 1500 ug of  fentanyl per dosage form. For example, a dosage form of the  invention for administration to  adults may contain about  18.75, 22.5, 37.5,56, 75, 112.5, 150,300,450, 600, 750,900,  1050, 1350 or 1500 ug or more offentanyl for oral transmu  cosal delivery.   The dosage forms of the invention contain from about 10 to  about 10000 ug of alfentanil per dosage form for oral trans  mucosal delivery. As will be understood by those of skill in  the art, the dose will be on the low end of the range for  children and the high end of the range for adults dependent  upon body mass, in particular when administered long term to  opioid-tolerant adults.   Exemplary dosage forms of the invention for administra  tion of alfentanil contain from about 10 ug to about 10 mg of  alfentanil per dosage form. For example, a dosage form of the  invention for administration may contain about 10, 25, 50.  150, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 7000,  9000 or 10000 ug of alfentanil for oral transmucosal delivery.  In a different exemplary embodiment, a dosage form for  use in the treatment of pain may comprise from about 0.25 to  about 200 ug of sufentanil in combination with from about 2  to about 1500 ug offentanyl or from about 0.25 to about 200   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   24  ug of sufentanilor from about 2 to about 1500 lug offentanyl  in combination with one or more additional drugs.   Remifentanil, lofentanil, carfentanil, trefentanil and mir  fentanil are potent fentanyl congeners which may be suitable  for treatment of acute pain when delivered via a bioadhesive  transmucosal formulation of this invention. The dose ranges  for exemplary formulations of these congeners may include  0.25ug to 99.9 mg for both adult and pediatric patients. These  dosages may be repeated at appropriate time intervals, Suit  ably defined for each molecule.   Alfentanil is also a potent fentanyl congener that is rapidly  metabolized and may be suitable for use when delivered via a  bioadhesive  transmucosal  formulation  of this  invention.  Appropriate dosing of alfentanil may be in the range of 10 ug  to 10 mg for both adult and pediatric patients. These dosages  may be repeated at appropriate time intervals.   Patients suffering from chronic painful conditions can also  have intermittent exacerbations of their pain, requiring acute  use of fast-acting breakthrough opioids in addition to their use  of slow-onset time-release opioids for their baseline chronic  pain.   Breakthrough pain or procedural pain can be intense for  short periods of time, as short as 1 or 2 minutes or as long as  30 minutes or more, therefore there would be a significant  advantage in providing an opioid formulation that produced  more rapid clinically effective plasma levels with a more  consistent and predictable period of effect.   Opioids remain the most powerful from of analgesics,  however, improved forms are needed that have minimal side  effects, and can be provided in a manner in which patient use  can be easily tracked by the physician.   Using current treatment methods, pain control is attempted  using a number of interventions, which generally include:  intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), continuous  epidural infusion (CEI), other types of acute pain control,  palliative care pain control, and home health patient pain  control. These methods meet with varying degrees of success  with respect to duration of control, ease of treatment and  safety versus side effects.   The need for rapid treatment of acute pain occurs in many  different clinical situations, including post-operative recu  peration, rheumatoid arthritis, failed back, end-stage cancer,  etc. Post-operatively, for example, patients suffer from severe  pain for the first few days followed by days of mild to mod  erate levels of pain.   The most common analgesic used to treat moderate to  severe post-operative pain is  IV morphine. This is either  delivered on an \u201cas needed  basis by a nurse to the patient by  an IV injection or commonly a morphine Syringe is placed in  a PCA pump and the patient self-administers the opioid by  pressing abutton which has a lock-out feature. Other opioids,  Such as hydromorphone and fentanyl may also be used in this   a.  Treatment of acute pain is also necessary for patients in an  outpatient setting. For example, many patients suffer from  chronic pain and require the use of opioids on a weekly or  daily basis to treat their pain. While they may have a long  acting oral or transdermal opioid preparations to treat their  chronic underlying pain levels, they often need short-acting  potent opioids to treat their severe breakthrough pain levels.  Treatment of acute pain is also necessary \u201cin the field'  under highly sub-optimal conditions. Paramedics or military  medics often are required to treat severe acute pain in un  sterile situations, where needles used for IV or IM adminis  tration can result in unintended needle Sticks, risk of infec  tion, etc. Oral opioid tablets often take 60 minutes to provide  relief which is too long for someone in severe pain.   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   25  In a number of clinical settings, there is clearly a need for  a formulation that produces effective pain relief in a manner  that is titratable, may be used safely and conveniently, and  provides pain relief for severe breakthrough or intermittent  pain over an appropriate period of time.   5   V. Use of Formulations of the Invention   Oral transmucosal drug delivery is simple, non-invasive,  and can be administered by the caregiver or the patient with  minimal discomfort. Generally, oral transmucosal delivery of  pharmaceuticals is achieved using Solid dosage forms such as  lozenges or tablets, however, liquids, sprays, gels, gums,  powders, and films may also be used.   For certain drugs, such as those with poor bioavailability  15   10   via the GI tract, such as many lipophilic opioids, oral trans  mucosal (OT) delivery may provide a better delivery route  than GI delivery. For drugs such as opioids, oral transmucosal  delivery has shorter onset time (i.e., the time from adminis  tration to therapeutic effect) than does oral GI delivery and  provides significantly improved bioavailability.   Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Formulation Attributes  The uptake of medications from the bioadhesive transmu  cosal formulations of the present invention results in a more  consistent delivery between individual dosages and indi  vidual patients as compared to that of currently available oral  transmucosal dosage forms for which a large fraction of drug  uptake occurs via the GI route.   The bioadhesive transmucosal formulations of the present  invention are designed to work effectively in the unique envi  ronment of the oral cavity such that a limited amount of fluid,  a relatively short period of time for drug dissolution, and pH  levels within the oral cavity do not adversely affect absorption  of the drug (FIG. 11). The dosage forms are also designed to  improve dissolution, solubility, and stability of the drug. The  advantages of the present invention include the ability to  provide higher levels of drug absorption via oral transmu  cosal delivery, and consistent dose-to-effect times, making  the present formulation a significant improvement for the  treatment of acute or break-through pain.   25   30   35   40   The oral transmucosal formulations of the present inven  tion are designed to avoid the high peak plasma levels of  intravenous dosage forms by utilizing the oral mucosa and by  controlling both tablet disintegration (or erosion) and drug  dissolution and release from the tablet over time to provide a 45  safer delivery profile. The oral transmucosal formulations of  the present invention provide individual, repetitive doses that  include a defined amount of the active agent, thereby allowing  the patient to accurately titrate the amount of drug delivered  and to adjust the amount as appropriate in a safe and effective  50   a.  An advantage of the bioadhesive oral transmucosal formu  lations described in this invention is that they exhibit consis  tent bioavailability and can maintain the plasma drug concen  tration  within  a  targeted  therapeutic  window  with  55  significantly lower variability for a longer duration than cur  rently available Solid dosage forms. The high peak plasma  levels typically observed for IV dosage forms are blunted  following administration of a formulation of the invention,  which are characterized by sustained release of the drug. In  60  addition, a rapid decline in plasma levels is avoided since the  drug is continually crossing from the oral cavity into the  bloodstream during the length of time of dissolution of the  tablet or longer, thus providing plasma pharmacokinetics  with an extended plateau phase as compared to the IV route of 65  administration. Further, the dosage forms of this invention  may improve treatment safety by minimizing the potentially   26  deleterious side effects due to the relative reduction of the  peaks and troughs in the plasma drug pharmacokinetics,  which compromise treatment safety and is typical of cur  rently available dosage forms.   Advantages of solid Sublingual formulations of the present  invention over various liquid forms for either sublingual or  intranasal administration of opioids include the Sustained  local release of the Solid dosage form and the avoidance of  Swallowing of drug from administration of liquid dosage  forms either via the nasal or the oral route. Published phar  macokinetic data on intranasal Sufentanil liquid administra  tion (15ug) in humans demonstrates a bioavailability of 78%  (Helmers et al.  Comparison of intravenous and intranasal  Sufentanil absorption and sedation. Canadian Journal of Ana  esthesia  36:494-497,  1989).  Sublingual liquid  sufentanil  administration (5ug) in Beagle dogs (Example 8) resulted in  a bioavailability of 40%. Both these bioavailabilities are less  than the 91% average that was obtained in human volunteers  using Sufentanil administered Sublingually in the form of a  NanoTab(R) formulation of the invention or greater than the  75% bioavailability obtained in the animal studies (Examples  7-12 below).   The oral transmucosal dosage forms of the invention are  designed to fit comfortably under the tongue such that the  drug-loaded dosage form disintegrates Sufficiently slowly to  avoid the immediate peak plasma levels followed by signifi  cant drop-off seen in prior art formulations such as described  in U.S. Pat. No. 6,759,059 (Rapinyl), wherein fentanyl was  administered via tablets containing 400g offentanyl which  resulted in a peak plasma level of 2.5 ng/mL followed by an  immediate drop in plasma levels. Fentora (fentanyl buccal  tablets) also suffers from a lack of a plateau phase but rather  has a steep incline up to the C  followed by a significant  drop-off in plasma levels (Fentora package insert).   The bioadhesive transmucosal formulations described in  this invention are designed to form two specific kinds of  delivery vehicles: hydrogels and eroding tablets. These fol  low two distinct disintegration and drug release mechanisms  based on (i) diffusion from a hydrogel and (ii) erosion with  diffusion from the eroding-type tablets. Using these funda  mental designs the formulations of the invention can be  designed to be fast-,  intermediate- or slow-disintegrating.  These system architectures are vastly different from efferves  cent-type tablets which are designed to breakdown rapidly by  use of carbonate-type (or other) excipients. In addition, they  are  fundamentally  different  from dosage forms that are  designed to disintegrate into large carrierparticles that carry  the Smaller (typically micron-sized) drug particles following  ordered  mixing. The architecture of the transmucosal for  mulations of the present invention does not pose any require  ments for specific particle sizes of drug or excipient particles,  nor does require disintegration to the  drug-coated  carrier  particles to achieve the desired performance.   The bioadhesive transmucosal formulations of the present  invention can be designed to manipulate and control the phar  macokinetic profile of the active drug. As such, the formula  tions can be adjusted to achieve fast disintegration and fast  drug release and thus enable fast pharmacokinetic profiles  that provide fast onset of action, while maintaining the other  performance attributes of the tablet such as bioadhesion,  reproducibility of action, blunted C, etc. Such fast-disin  tegrating tablets  may be engineered to  disintegrate from  within 30 seconds up to 20 minutes and enable pharmacoki  netic profiles that can vary accordingly with duration of  action that can vary from 10 minutes to 1-2 hours. Alterna  tively,  the formulations of the present invention  can be  adjusted to achieve  intermediate  erosion times and drug   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   27  release and thus enable  intermediate pharmacokinetic pro  files that provide a more Sustained action. Although Such  formulations may still provide a fast onset of action, they are  mostly designed to enable the longer sustained effect while  maintaining the other performance attributes of the tablet  Such as bioadhesion, reproducibility of action, blunted C,  etc. Such  intermediate-disintegrating tablets may be engi  neered to disintegrate from within 30 seconds up to 30 min  utes  and enable pharmacokinetic profiles  that  can  vary  accordingly. Finally, the formulations of the present invention  can be adjusted to achieve  slow disintegration times (and  erosion kinetic profiles) and slow drug release and thus enable  very prolonged PK that provides Sustained drug action.  Although Such formulations may be designed to still provide  a fast onset, they are mostly intended to enable the Sustained  drug PK and effect while maintaining the other performance  attributes of the tablet such as bioadhesion, reproducibility of  action, blunted C, etc. Such slowly-disintegrating tablets  may be engineered to disintegrate from within 15 minutes to  up to 8 hours and enable pharmacokinetic profiles that can  vary accordingly.   10   15   Further, the bioadhesive transmucosal dosage formula  tions of this invention can exhibit the aforementioned perfor  mance with a number of active drugs that may span a wide  range of physicochemical properties, such as water solubility,  partition coefficient, etc., as further described herein.   In addition, an important advantage exhibited by the oral  transmucosal formulations of the present invention is the  pH-independent nature of drug dissolution for drugs over the  range of pH 4.5 and 8.0. pH-independence of drug dissolution  minimizes the effect of environmental conditions on drug  dissolution and absorption and provides consistently high  bioavailability as described above. Further, normal physi  ologic or disease state saliva pH is typically between 4.5-8.0.  Thus, the pH-independence of drug dissolution over a pH  range of 4.5-8.0 exhibited by formulations of the invention  provides advantages over prior art formulations.   Finally, the performance and attributes of the bioadhesive  transmucosal formulations of this invention are independent  of the manufacturing process. A number of conventional,  well-established and known in the art processes can be used to  manufacture the formulations of the present invention (Such  as wet and dry granulation, direct compression, etc). without  impacting the dosage form physicochemical properties or in  Vivo performance.   Pharmacokinetics\u2014Animal Studies  Selected dosage forms comprising formulations of the  invention were tested in a suitable animal model to evaluate  the pharmacokinetics following Sublingual administration  and thus elucidate the properties of the formulations of the  present invention. Comparisons of oral transmucosal drug  delivery using formulations of the invention relative to liquid  sublingual administration as well as swallowed NanoTabs(R)  were made to evaluate their performance. The results support  our claim that the bioadhesive formulations of the invention  are well tolerated Sublingually in dogs, result in higher bio  availability and more consistent pharmacokinetic profiles  than  other  oral  transmucosal  dosage  forms,  including  instilled liquids. Further, they demonstrate the ability of the  transmucosal formulations of this invention to blunt the C.  and modify the drug absorption profile to achieve fast, inter  mediate or prolonged absorption.   In order to demonstrate the broad applicability of the bio  adhesive transmucosal dosage forms of this invention, formu  lations were prepared with three different opioids: Sufentanil  citrate, fentanyl citrate and alfentanil hydrochloride. These  molecules, albeit members of the same opioid family of anal   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   28  gesics, span a wide range of log P values (between 0.006 and  3.382), as shown in Table 1A. The ability of the formulations  of the current invention to similarly manipulate the in vivo  pharmacokinetics of these distinct molecules in vivo demon  strates the broad applicability of the formulations of the  present invention to a wide range of molecules with distinct  physicochemical characteristics.   TABLE 1A   Physicochemical Properties of Selected Opioids.

A total of three  Beagle dogs were studied and the results of the pharmacoki  netic analysis are presented in FIG.3 and tabulated in Table  13. All tablets disintegrated in <20 min following adminis  tration in dogs. The bioavailability sufentanil from the sub  lingual NanoTabR formulation was 74.8+10.7 compared to  IV, thus confirming the superior attributes of the formulation  over other dosage forms or formulation types (effervescent,  etc). The coefficient of variation for the bioavailability was  low (CV-14.4%) compared to that of other commercial trans  mucosal dosage forms, indicating unexpectedly very repro  ducible and efficient delivery. Absorption from the sublingual  NanoTabR formulations is  fast  with an average T  of  approximately 12 minutes, while the onset of delivery occurs  within 7 minutes from administration. However, in contrast to  IV administration, the formulation blunts the absorption  maximum by 2-3-fold compared to  IV.  In  addition,  the  absorption half-life is extended significantly (3.3-fold over  IV) indicating a more Sustained absorption profile.   An important mathematical ratio that demonstrates the  prolonged plateau phase of the measured blood plasma levels  of Sufentanil following administration of the transmucosal  bioadhesive formulations is  the Therapeutic Time Ratio,  which is defined as the time spent above 50% of C,  nor  malized by the known IV terminal elimination half-life of the  drug:   The Therapeutic Time Ratio of the sublingual sufentanil  formulation of this example is 0.28 whereas the ratio for IV  sufentanil is 0.05 (using the published IV elimination half-life  of Sufentanil in dogs of 139 minutes). Therefore, the trans  mucosal formulation (#44) resulted in a 5.6-fold increased  therapeutic time ratio compared to IV Sufentanil, indicating  that after delivery from a sublingual bioadhesive formulation  of this invention, Sufentanilachieves and remains within effi  cacious therapeutic levels for longer time compared to IV.  This example highlights some of the advantages of the Sub  lingual  Sufentanil  formulations  of this  invention,  which  include (i) efficient and reproducible delivery (ii) fast onset of  action (iii) blunted C  of absorption and (iv) prolonged  absorption profile. These attributes Suggest that the transmu  cosal  formulations  of the present  invention  can lead to  improved drug therapeutic benefit while minimizing side  effects and improving the safety of drug administration.   Another study in Beagle dogs was performed to evaluate  the advantages of the Sublingual formulations over liquid   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   29  administration sublingually. This study is described in detail  in Example 8 (Table 14). The results (presented in Table 15  and FIG. 4) indicate that although sublingual delivery of  Sufentanil (5 Jug) via instillation from a liquid dosage form  results in rapid T., this  method of drug administration  results in very low absorption (F=40.0+32.5%) and very high  variability of absorption (83.1% CV) compared to the sublin  gual sufentanil formulation of Example 7. This is probably  due to partial oral absorption of the drug following partial  Swallowing of the instilled liquid. The C  is also highly  variable with this method of drug administration, exhibiting a  high coefficient of variation of 72%. The Therapeutic Time  Ratio for the instilled liquid sufentanil was calculated as  0.04+0.02, which is very similar to the IV sufentanil arm.  Therefore, Sublingual instillation from a liquid does not pro  vide the advantageous therapeutic plateau observed with the  Sublingual formulation. These findings demonstrate that the  high sublingual bioavailability observed from the bioadhe  sive formulations claimed in this application is not intrinsic to  the molecule but rather it is a direct result of the unique design  of the dosage form and its formulation. The transmucosal  formulation's strong adhesion to the Sublingual cavity mini  mizes the variability in the surface area available for absorp  tion, as is the case of a liquid solution, thus improving deliv  ery of the molecule to the systemic circulation. In addition,  owing to its unique design and Small dimensions, the Nano  TabR does not elicit significant saliva production, thus reduc  ing the potential for ingestion of the released drug. Both  factors  contribute to the higher and more uniform drug  absorption from the Sublingual cavity.   In another part of the same study (presented in Example 9),  the bioavailability of sufentanil following swallowing of the  NanoTab(R) was determined in the same animal model. Since  there is little to no literature data on the GI sufentanil bio  availability, it was important to evaluate the bioavailability of  this route of administration to further support the observation  that drug from the Sublingual administration of formulations  could not be swallowed and maintain a high bioavailability.  As indicated by the PKanalysis data in Table 15, oral absorp  tion of sufentanil from the bioadhesive tablets results in very  low drug bioavailability (F=12.2+16.3%). The low absorp  tion leads to high variability in PK, e.g., in the amount of drug  absorbed and the pharmacokinetics of absorption  (C,  T) as shown in Table 15 (134.2% CV). The data further  demonstrate that absorption from the bioadhesive formula  tion of Example #7 occurred almost exclusively via sublin  gual rather than GI absorption in contrast to commercially  available opioid transmucosal dosage forms, in which a con  siderable amount of the drug is  delivered to the GI tract  (ActiqR  75%: FentoraR)\u201450% oral  absorption).  These  findings Support the conclusion that the bioadhesive Sublin  gual formulations of the current invention strongly adhere in  the Sublingual cavity in Such a manner that they don\u2019t dis  lodge, thus avoiding oral ingestion and avoiding the high  variability of plasma levels which is typical when drug is  absorbed via the GI route.   In certain embodiments, the bioadhesive transmucosal for  mulations of the present invention can be modified in order to  manipulate and control the pharmacokinetic profile. As an  example the formulations can be adjusted to achieve fast  disintegration and drug release and thus enable fast pharma  cokinetic profiles that enable fast onset of action, while main  taining the other performance attributes of the tablet such as  bioadhesion, reproducibility of action, blunted C, etc.  Such fast-disintegrating tablets may be engineered to disin  tegrate from within 30 seconds up to 20 minutes and enable  pharmacokinetic profiles that can vary accordingly with dura   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   30  tion of action that can vary from 10 minutes to 1-2 hours.  Alternatively, the formulations of the present invention can be  adjusted to achieve intermediate erosion times (and erosion  kinetic profiles) and drug release and thus enable intermedi  ate pharmacokinetic profiles that provide a more Sustained  action. Although Such formulations may still provide a fast  onset of action, they are mostly designed to enable the longer  Sustained effect while maintaining the other performance  attributes of the tablet such as bioadhesion, reproducibility of  action, blunted C, etc. Such intermediate-disintegrating  tablets may be engineered to disintegrate from within 30  seconds up to 30 minutes and enable pharmacokinetic pro  files that can vary accordingly. Finally, the formulations of the  present invention can be adjusted to achieve  slow disinte  gration times (and erosion kinetic profiles) and slow drug  release and thus enable very prolonged pharmacokinetic pro  files that provide Sustained drug action. Although Such for  mulations may be designed to still provide a fast onset, they  are mostly intended to enable the sustained drug PK and  effect while maintaining the other performance attributes of  the tablet  such as bioadhesion, reproducibility of action,  blunted C, etc. Such slowly-disintegrating tablets may be  engineered to disintegrate from within 15 minutes to up to 8  hours and enable pharmacokinetic profiles that can vary  accordingly.   In addition, the pharmacokinetic profiles obtained from  Such bioadhesive Sublingual formulations may vary depend  ing on the dosage form design, geometry, compositions, etc.  Examples of Such PK profiles include ascending plasma pro  files, which resemblebell-shaped curves, profiles that exhibit  more than a single peak, prolonged seemingly flat PK profiles  over the entire duration of action or intermediate profiles. Of  particular  interest  are  bi-phasic  absorption  profiles  that  exhibit a fast release component followed by a slow, extended  release phase.   It should be noted that the bioadhesive transmucosal for  mulation described herein (whether the fast-, intermediate- or  slow-disintegrating type) are neither effervescent nor do they  disintegrate to the individual carrier particles comprising the  dosage form.   To demonstrate the ability of the bioadhesive transmucosal  formulations of the present invention to enable such distinct  pharmacokinetic profiles, a number of formulations (#54  #58) were prepared in Example 10 representing both hydro  gel- and eroding-type formulations. They were prepared with  Sufentanil citrate and designed to provide fast, intermediate  and slow release of the drug from the dosage form. The  formulations, which are described in Table 16, were prepared  by direct compression, as described in Example 1, except for  formulation #56, which was prepared by wet granulation, as  described in  Example 3 and were evaluated in a healthy  conscious Beagle dog model, as described in Example 10 and  Table 17.  Sufentanil Administration from Fast- and Medium-Disinte  grating Formulations (#55, 54).   The analytical results are shown in FIG.5 and the results of  the pharmacokinetic analysis are summarized in Table 18.  Tablets of formulation #55 disintegrated in <5 min following  administration, while tablets of formulation #54 disintegrated  in <20 minutes. Formulation #54 exhibited a fast onset of  action (T-7.1+0.5 min) and a relatively fast T  (as early  as 10 minutes) following administration. In-spite of the fast  onset of action, the formulation resulted in blunting of the  C, albeit Smaller than the longer-acting formulation of  Example 7 and a somewhat prolonged action, as indicated by  the longer plasma half-life (26.7+2.2 min) compared to IV.  The performance of this formulation mirrors that of Example,   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   31  7,  in  that  it  maintains  high  sufentanil  bioavailability  (F=90.4+25.3% compared to IV) and low coefficient of varia  tion (CV-28%) compared to other commercial transmucosal  dosage forms. Finally, the TTR was increased 3-fold com  pared to IV, thereby confirming the very reproducible and  efficient delivery enabled by the formulations of the present  invention over other dosage forms or formulation types.   Formulation #54 exhibits a similarly fast (albeit slower  than Formulation #55) onset of action (T=9.2+4.3 min)  and a relatively slower T  (25.0+8.7 min), while it enables  increased blunting of the C. In addition, it displays more  prolonged action, as indicated by the longer plasma half-life  (49.2+22 min) compared to IV. Still, the formulation exhibits  high bioavailability (F-88.2+28.9%) of sufentanil and an  enhanced therapeutic benefit as indicated by the almost 6-fold  increase of the TTR (0.28+0.13) compared to IV.  Sufentanil Administration from Slow-Disintegrating Formu  lation (#58).   The  tablets  of this  formulation  disintegrated  slowly  between 35 and 120 minutes following administration. This  formulation  exhibited  a  very  slow  onset  of  action  (T  48.0-34.1 min) and Sustained Sufentanil pharmaco  kinetics even after 8 hours post-administration (plasma half  life of 205-93.1 min). The prolonged PK resulted in signifi  cant (almost 2.4-fold) blunting of the C  compared to IV  and a very pronounced increase (almost 22.6-fold) of the TTR  (range of 8.8-36.4). These examples serve to illustrate the  ability of the bioadhesive transmucosal formulations of the  present invention to modify and control the drug release and  pharmacokinetic action of the drug in vivo.   To further demonstrate the ability of the bioadhesive trans  mucosal formulations of the present invention to modify and  control drug pharmacokinetics independent of the type of  drug and its physicochemical properties, a number of formu  lations were prepared with two additional opioids, fentanyl  and alfentanil.   As presented in Example 11, a number of formulations  (#59-#62) were prepared (by direct compression) with fenta  nyl citrate representing both hydrogel- and eroding-type,  designed to achieve intermediate and slow release of the drug.  They were evaluated in a healthy conscious Beagle dog  model, as described in Table 21. The results of the PKanalysis  are summarized in Table 22 and the analytical results are  illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8.  Fentanyl Administration from Medium-Disintegrating For  mulations (#59, 60).   Tablets of formulation #59 disintegrated between 20 and  50 min, similarly with those of formulation #60 which disin  tegrated within 20 min following administration. Both for  mulations exhibited a relatively fast onset of action (16.2+6.8  and 9.0+2.6 min, respectively) and blunted the blunted the  C, albeit to a different extent each: 2.4-fold for formula  tion #59 and 6.7-fold for formulation #60. Further, they  achieved high drug bioavailability (around 95% compared to  IV) and low variability of absorption (8.4 and 10.5% for  formulations #59 and #60, respectively) compared to other  commercial transmucosal dosage forms. In addition, both  preparations significantly prolonged the drug PK. Formula  tion #59 exhibited a more pronounced absorption peak and  exhibited a plasma half-life of 75.5+32.5 minutes (7.5-fold  prolongation over IV). In contrast, formulation #60 exhibited  a more prolonged absorption profile, as shown by the 12.1-  fold extension of its plasma half life (121.5+19.1 minutes).  This prolongation of action was also reflected in the increased  TTR which increased by 6-fold for formulation #59 to 11.5-  fold for formulation #60. This data confirms that fentanyl  absorption via the bioadhesive transmucosal formulations of   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   32  this invention results in very reproducible and efficient deliv  ery over other dosage forms or formulation types (efferves  cent, etc).  Fentanyl Administration from Slow-Disintegrating Formula  tion (#62).   Tablets  of the  slowly-disintegrating  formulation  #62  eroded slower that the medium-disintegrating ones; erosion  was completed between 35 and 65 minutes. In contrast to the  medium-disintegrating formulations, the slow formulation  exhibited a delayed onset of action (43.6+20.7 min), albeit  maintained a very high bioavailability (F=99.0+4.4%) and  very low variability (CV-4.5%) compared to other commer  cial transmucosal dosage forms. This formulation provides an  even more prolonged absorption offentanyl compared to the  intermediate-disintegrating formulations: the plasma half  life is extended to 154.4+52.6 minutes, representing a very  prolonged drug absorption profile-a nearly 15.5-fold exten  sion for the duration of action compared to IV. This is also  reflected in the nearly 4-fold reduction of the C  compared  to IV. Finally, the Therapeutic Time Ratio is also increased  compared to  IV to  0.46+0.12, representing an  11.5-fold  increase.   In addition, as shown in Example 12, a bioadhesive trans  mucosal formulation (#63) was prepared with alfentanil  (Table 23) and was evaluated in a healthy conscious Beagle  dog model, as described in Table 24. The results of the phar  macokinetic analysis are summarized in Table 25 and the PK  analysis results are illustrated in FIG. 9.   Disintegration of both tablets of formulation #63 occurred  within 20 minutes from administration. Alfentanil adminis  tration from the bioadhesive formulation resulted in a high  bioavailability of 94% compared to IV alfentanil and a coef  ficient of variation of 15% for the bioavailability, 7% for C.  and 28% for T. The onset of alfentanil absorption from this  formulation was fast, occurring within 5 minutes from admin  istration. The formulation blunted the absorption peak by  almost 4-fold. Overall, the formulation enabled a sustained  absorption profile of the drug, as indicated by the 8-to-10-fold  increased plasma half-life (40.8 vs. 4.4 minutes). The TTR  was calculated to be 0.33, compared to 0.04 for the IV alfen  tanil arm of this study (calculated using a published IV elimi  nation half-life of 104 min for alfentanil in dogs). Therefore,  the alfentanil transmucosal  formulation (as  described  in  Example 12) produces an 8-fold improved TTR over the IV  alfentanil arm. The high bioavailability of this formulation  again Supports the claim that minimal Swallowing of drug  occurs with use of a NanoTab(R).   These examples illustrate the highly efficacious delivery of  a number of molecules from the bioadhesive transmucosal  formulations, which enabled high drug bioavailability with  low variability for all three drugs examined. The overall drug  efficacy is also portrayed in the enhanced Therapeutic Time  Ratio indicating that after delivery from a sublingual formu  lation of the present invention, the drug achieves and remains  within efficacious therapeutic levels longer than intravenous  administration. In addition, the above data Support the claim  of the transmucosal bioadhesive formulations of the present  invention are capable of controlling the drug release and  enable a number of modified pharmacokinetic profiles, rang  ing from fast, intermediate, to slow drug absorption.  In Vivo Pharmacokinetics\u2014Human Clinical Study   The pharmacokinetics of Sufentanil following Sublingual  administration of selected bioadhesive formulations (#46,  #47 and #48 described in Table 9) were evaluated in a cross  over clinical study, which is described in detail in Example  13, involving healthy, naltrexone-blocked human volunteers.   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   15   10   25   33  The transmucosal formulations eroded over a period of  10-30 minutes in all subjects. In addition, there was only one  incident of tablet dislodgment from the point of administra  tion out of a total of 72 tablet administrations, indicating  strong bioadhesion of the tablet to the sublingual cavity. Sub-  5  lingual sufentanil administration from the bioadhesive for  mulations results in a remarkably consistent pharmacokinetic  profile as illustrated in FIG. 10 and summarized in Table 26.  The bioavailability compared to IV (for single administra  tion) of all three dosages averaged 91%, which is far superior  to that measured for commercially available fentanyl trans  mucosal preparations, Actiq and Fentora (47% and 65%,  respectively\u2014Fentora package insert). Although the attain  ment of high bioavailability could be due to a number of  factors, it can be largely attributed to the reduced (if any)  Swallowing of the drug owing to both (i) the strong tablet  bioadhesion to the sublingual mucosa that did not allow its  dislodgment and Subsequent Swallowing, but also (ii) the lack  of increased saliva production due to the small size of the  dosage form. In contrast to these findings, both commercial  products of Fentora and Actiq (as stated in their package  inserts) claim at least 50% and 75% of the drug dose, respec  tively, is Swallowed via salivaingestion, thus leading to lower  bioavailability than the formulations of the present invention.  This  finding  mirrors  the  results  of the  animal  studies  described in Examples 7-12, which indicate very high bio  availability for the transmucosal formulations of this inven  tion. All studies presented in this invention Support the con  clusion  that  greater than  75% of the  drug is  absorbed  transmucosally. Therefore, less than 25% of the drug is swal  lowed, which is a much lower to that reported by the afore  mentioned commercial products.   40   35   Importantly, this high bioavailability is also linked to high  reproducibility of delivery, as indicated by the low coeffi  cients of variation for bioavailability of 24.7-34.1% for the  three formulations evaluated compared to 20.1% for IV. This  is much lower than that reported for Fentora (CV-45%) and  Actiq (CV-41%) (Fentora package insert). Therefore the  total dose delivered to the patient/subject is not only more  bioavailable for the sufentanil formulations of this invention  but it is more consistently the same from patient to patient.  Although, as described above, this may be due to a number of  factors, this is largely due to (i) the strong bioadhesion of the  transmucosal dosage form in all patients, thereby reducing  movement of the tablet and thereby decreasing variability of 45  absorption and (ii) the reduced Swallowing of the drug.   The Sufentanil Sublingual formulations are also Superior in  terms of consistent drug plasma levels early after administra  tion. The C  obtained with formulation #48 was 27.5+7.7  pg/ml with a CV of only 28%. In contrast, the Fentora and 50  Actiq C.  41-56% and 33%, respectively (Fentora package insert).   suffers from increased variability with CVs of   In addition to Superior bioavailability and consistency in  plasma concentrations, the T  is a very important param  eter due to the requirement for quick and consistent onset of 55  pain relief is important in the treatment of acute pain. The  T  for the transmucosal formulation #48 was 40.8+13.2  minutes (range 19.8-60 minutes) which is superior to the  reported average T  for Fentora (46.8 min with a range of  20-240 min) and Actiq (90.8 min, range 35-240 min) (Fentora  60  package insert). Therefore the bioadhesive transmucosal for  mulations of this invention offer markedly improved onset  and consistency in the onset of analgesia over Fentora and  Actiq, with a 400% decrease in the slowest onset of T.   Important in the treatment of acute pain, especially acute  65   breakthrough pain, is a consistent and relatively short half  life of the drug. The plasma elimination half-life of the 10 ug   30   34  Sufentanil NanoTab(R) was 1.71+0.4 hours, which allows the  drug to be titratable for various levels of pain. If the break  through pain event lasts longer than 1.5 hours then the patient  can dose with another NanoTabR. The half-life of Actiq and  Fentora are 3.2 hours and 2.63 hours, respectively, for the  lowest doses. The half-lives for the higher doses increase  substantially for these drugs, thereby limiting the titratability  of these drugs.   Another aspect of the PK curves generated by sublingual  Sufentanil formulations tested in the human studies is the  plateau phase, which allows for a period of consistent plasma  levels, which is important for both safety and efficacy. Com  pared to either IV bolus administration (see Animal Studies  Examples 7-12) or the 10 minute IV infusion in the human  study (Example 13), the PK profile for the sufentanil formu  lations is clearly safer, as they result in blunting of the C.  plasma levels. Given the ability of opioids to produce respi  ratory depression, avoiding these high peaks in the PK profile  is advantageous.   The time spent above 50% of C.   on average for the 12  Volunteers for the 2.5, 5 and 10 ug dosage strengths was 110,  111 and 106 minutes, respectively, resulting in TTRs (for all  the sufentanil formulations evaluated in the clinical study)  that ranged from 0.72-0.75. These values are well in agree  ment with those obtained in the animal studies with Sufentanil  formulations (0.14-1.13). As the transmucosal formulation is  modified to enable shorter or longer disintegration times, the  Therapeutic Time Ratio may be modified from approximately  0.2-2.0 for sufentanil in humans.   In addition, the Therapeutic Time Ratio is a measure of  how Successfully short-acting drugs are formulated to pro  duce an increase in therapeutic time and increase safety by  avoiding  high  peak  plasma  C  concentrations.  For  example, as a comparison, the Sufentanil IV arm of the human  study demonstrated a Therapeutic Time Ratio of 0.067. This  low ratio value for the IV arm, therefore, is a measure of the  high peak produced by IV infusion of Sufentanil and demon  strates that this formulation does not produce a significant  plateau phase. In contrast, the bioadhesive transmucosal for  mulations  evaluated  in  the  clinical  study  demonstrated  10-fold higher Therapeutic Time Ratios versus IV, thereby  Supporting a prolonged therapeutic plateau profile for these  formulations.   In Summary, the data from both the clinical and animal  studies clearly demonstrate the advantages of the bioadhesive  transmucosal formulations  of the present invention  over  intravenous delivery and delivery from commercially avail  able  product  based  on  conventional  technologies.  The  examples provided herein provide compelling data that dem  onstrate (i) efficient and reproducible delivery (ii) fast onset  of action (iii) blunted C  of absorption and (iv) prolonged  absorption profile. These attributes suggest that the bioadhe  sive  formulations  of the  present  invention  can  lead  to  improved drug therapeutic benefit while minimizing side  effects and improving the safety of drug administration.  In Vitro Formulation Characterization   In Vitro Bioadhesion Force  As illustrated in Example 5, the transmucosal formulations  of the present invention can be engineered to demonstrate  varying degrees of bioadhesion. In the exemplary formula  tions of that example, the transmucosal formulations exhib  ited attachment forces to the porcine mucosa Substrate that  varied between 0.03 to 0.18 N/cm. The determined forces of  attachment correlate directly to the magnitude of the force of  adhesion in  vivo. It  is important to note that the specific  experimental conditions (such as contact time, rinsing, etc)  are expected to significantly influence the recorded detach   \f35  ment force; for example increased contact time will lead to  increased interaction and thereby increased force of adhe  sion. For the determinations the 2 minutes of contact time  were selected to reflect the contact time of a fast-disintegrat  ing formulation.   The results  summarized in  Table  11  indicate  that  the  strength of adhesion of the selected transmucosal formula  tions of Example 5 varied over a 6-fold range. However, the  formulations  of this  invention  are  expected  to  exhibit  strengths of adhesion that can extend well beyond this experi  mentally determined range. It is anticipated that the strength  of bioadhesion of the formulations presented in this invention  can be modified over the range of 0.005-1.0 N/cm (500-10  dyn/cm).  In Vitro Drug Dissolution Kinetics   Sufentanil citrate dissolution from formulations #46-#48  (FIG. 2) follows diffusion-type kinetics according to Higu  chi\u2019s law. This type of release is the signature of hydrogel  type systems. In addition, the data is described well by the  Korsmeyer & Peppas equation (Korsmeyer, R. W., Gurney,  R. Doecker, E., Buri, P., Peppas, N.A., Mechanisms of solute  release from hydrophilic polymers, J. Pharm. Sci. 15:25-35,  1983), with R values between 0.96-0.98. Fitting of the dis  Solution curve indicated that drug release from all three sys  tems was independent of the amount of drug loaded and that  the exponent in returned fitted values of 0.566+0.109 (0.068%  w/w sufentanil citrate tablet),  0.673+0.123 (0.163% w/w  sufentanil  citrate  tablet)  and 0.446+0.116  (0.273% w/w  sufentanil citrate  tablet).  It  is  noted that all  values of n  approach 0.5, which indicates Fickian diffusion-controlled  release which is somewhat influenced by the swelling of the  tablet, further corroborating the hydrogel-type release from  these formulations.   As also  demonstrated  in  vivo  (Examples 7-12),  it  is  expected that the formulations of this invention can exhibit a  range of dissolution profiles that may extend from a few  minutes (2-4 min) to over several hours (6-8). In addition,  depending on the drug physicochemical properties, the for  mulation composition and tablet design (such as physical  dimensions, presence of coatings, number of coating layers,  etc),  the obtained in  vitro  drug dissolution profiles  may  exhibit a number of dissolution kinetics, such as first or sec  ond order, diffusion or erosion-based or following a mixed  erosion-diffusion mechanism.   Dissolution testing of the colored dye (a surrogate for the  active drug) from various formulations was performed in  distilled water, using USP Apparatus 1 (Distek Technologies)  and analyzed by UV-Vis detection at 590 nm for bromocresol  blue. Each tablet was placed in 100  basket which were  then placed in 100-mL glass dissolution vessels containing 5  mL of dissolution media, thermostated at 37+0.5\u00b0C. Samples  were pulled at selected intervals and analyzed using an Agi  lent 8453 UV-Vis spectrophotometer using a 1 cm-pathlength  flow-through cell with Agilent 1 FS sipper system. The in  vitro dissolution of the dye for the NanoTabs was evaluated  with selected formulations. The results are presented in FIG.  11.  Effect of Effect of pH on Sufentanil Formulation Dissolution  In Vitro.   Sufentanil  dissolution kinetics  from formulation  HA34  loaded with 80  g of Sufentanil base was determined in a  Type II  USP dissolution  apparatus suitably  modified to  accommodate a small Volume NanoTabR containing a small  amount of sufentanil.  Drug release from the bioadhesive  transmucosal formulations were monitored by LC/MS. The   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   US 8,865,211 B2   36  results are shown in FIG. 11 and denote the similarity of the  dissolution kinetics of sufentanil from the dosage form within  the pH ranges examined.  Hardness   Dosage form hardness can be determined by any pharma  ceutical-grade tablet hardness equipment, such as the Vankel  VK-200 Hardness Tester (manufactured by Varian Inc., Cary,  N.C.). The hardness of a given dosage form typically corre  lates with dosage form disintegration and may range from 0.1  to 50 kiloponds (+1% full scale). In general, for hardness  testing, the dosage form is placed between the  jaws\u2019 of a  hardness tester. The moving jaw moves toward the stationary  jaw until the dosage form is crushed and the dosage form  crushing force is measured by the apparatus. Exemplary hard  ness measurements for a dosage form of the invention, range  from about 4 to about 25 Newtons, as illustrated by the hard  ness values for a number of formulations shown in Table 1B.

In one approach to the invention, a dosage form, may be  delivered to the oral mucosa, using a single dose applicator.  The dosage form is provided in a child-resistant drug dispens   \fUS 8,865,211 B2   37  ing device or packaging and delivered to the oral mucosa, for  example, the Sublingual cavity. Alternatively, the dosage form  is administered with assistance with or without a device.   In one embodiment, a single dose applicator (SDA) is used  to administer variety of drug dosage forms, including a solid  tablet, a liquid capsule, a gel capsule, a liquid, agel, a powder,  a film, a strip, a ribbon, a spray, a mist, a patch, or any other  Suitable drug dosage form.   The single dose applicator (SDA) may contain the dosage  form within, may have the drug dosage form attached or  affixed to it, may have the dosage form dissolved in it, and  may afford a seal against moisture, humidity, and light. The  single dose applicator may be manually manipulated by a  patient, healthcare provider, or other user to place the dosage  form in the proper location for drug delivery.   In practicing the invention, a single- or multiple-dose  applicator or drug dispensing device may be used to deliver  tablets or other dosage forms into the hand, the mouth, under  the tongue, or to other locations appropriate for specific drug  delivery needs.   In one embodiment, a single- or multiple-dose applicator  or drug dispensing device is used to deliver a dosage form to  the oral mucosa, e.g., the Sublingual space.   The dosage forms inside the dispensing device remain dry  prior to dispensing, at which point a single dosage form is  dispensed from the device into the mouth, e.g., the Sublingual  space, wherein a patient\u2019s saliva will wet the tablet and allow  for tablet disintegration/erosion and drug dissolution.   The SDA may be provided as a pair of forceps, a Syringe, a  Stick or rod, a straw, a dropper, a sprayer or atomizer, or any  otherform suitable for the application of a single drug dosage  form. After use, the SDA may be disposed of, so as to elimi  nate the risk of contaminating the drug dispensing device with  saliva, or other contaminants.   For Sublingual administration, a small Volume dosage form  may be administered Sublingually by placement under the  tongue, adjacent to the frenulum using forceps. Alternatively,  a small Volume dosage form may be administered Sublin  gually by placement under the tongue, adjacent to the frenu  lum using a Syringe, a stick or rod, a straw, a dropper, or any  otherform suitable for the application of a single drug dosage  form, including but not limited to a SDA, as further described  herein.   The dosage forms may be provided in a package that con  sists  of molded plastic or laminate that has indentations  (\u201cblisters\u2019) into which a dosage form, is placed, referred to  herein as a \u201cblister pack\u201d. A cover, typically a laminated  material or foil, is used to seal to the molded part. A blister  pack may or may not have pre-formed or molded parts.   In one embodiment, the blister pack has two flexible layers  that are sealed with the dosage form in between and the  primary unit dose blister packalso serves as an applicator for  delivering a single dosage form to the Sublingual space, once  the child-resistant foil is peeled back.   In yet another embodiment of the invention, a long tape or  array of dosage forms sealed between a flexible blister layer  and a foil or otherwise breakable layer is provided. A pushrod  is positioned above a dosage form, and upon actuation pushes  against the blister, forcing the dosage form through the foil or  breakable layer, dispensing the dosage form.   Such blister packs may be provided in a child resistant   multiple dosage drug dispensing device.   FIGS. 15A-C, FIGS. 16A-F, FIGS. 18A-C and FIGS. 19A  and B are schematic depictions of exemplary embodiments of  a SDA of the invention.   In one approach, the present invention provides disposable  single dose applicators comprising ablister pack 151, which   5   10   15   25   30   40   45   50   55   60   65   38  contains drug dosage forms 67 inside a housing and a handle  131, wherein a backing, such as a foil seal 135 covers the  dosage form 67 and the handle 131, as shown for example in  FIGS. 16B and 16D.   In one embodiment, the disposable single dose applicator,  the combination of housing or tube 129 and handle 131 has  the shape of a spoon.   The housing or tube 129 for the dosage form 67 is ablister  pack 151 that accommodates a unit dose of a dosage form 67  for administration to a subject. The dosage form 67 is sealed  in the blister pack 151 by a foil or other type of seal 135.   In some embodiments, the foil or other type of seal 135 is  removed prior to administration of the dosage form 67 and the  handle 131 is used to place the dosage form 67 in the appro  priate location against the oral mucosa of the Subject such that  the dosage form 67 adheres to the oral mucosa. See, e.g.,  FIGS. 16B, 16D, 16E and 16F. In other embodiments, the foil  or other type of seal 135 is perforated and removed prior to  administration of the dosage form 67 by folding the applica  tor 123 at the perforation 149 prior to administration where  the handle 131 is used to place the dosage form 67 in the  appropriate location against the oral mucosa of a subject. See,  e.g., FIGS. 19A and B. This permits the handling of only a  single drug dosage form 67 at a time and prevents the other  individually sealed drug dosage forms 67 from becoming  exposed to Saliva, humidity and the like.   The foil or other type of seal 135 of a disposable applicator  123 including handle 131 is typically made of a single piece  of foil laminate, paper, plastic or other covering, i.e. an appli  cator tab 147 that spans the back of the housing or tube 129  alone or both the housing or tube 129 and the handle 131,  effectively seals the dosage form 67 in a blister pack 151 or  other container.   The handle 131 enables proper placement of the dosage   A plurality of single dose applicators may be provided as a  series of individual single dose applicators attached by the  backing or housed in multiple dose dispenser 137.   In another embodiment, a dispensing device 11 comprises  a package 141 that holds a single or multiple drug dosage  forms, a distal orifice for delivery of the drug dosage form,  and an internal mechanism that segregates and releases the  dosage forms. See, e.g., FIG. 17. The dispensing device is  typically handheld and may comprise some or all of the  features set forth above for a device used to dispense non  packaged dosage forms.   FIGS. 14A and 14B show one embodiment of a single dose  applicator 123 a dispensing device for delivering drug dosage  forms. The dispensing device shown in FIG. 14A depicts the  single dose applicator 123 that is ready to dispense a drug  dosage form 67. In one aspect of this embodiment, a user  pinches the single dose applicator 125 which opens the appli  cator and a drug dosage form 67 is dispensed as shown in FIG.  14B.   FIGS. 15A-C show an embodiment of a single dose appli  cator 123 that is comprised of a applicator shaped as a tube  129, a stopper seal 127, a handle 131 (e.g., an ergonomic  handle), and a single dosage form 67. FIG. 15A shows the  single dose applicator 123 in its sealed configuration, prior to  use. FIG. 15B shows the single dose applicator 123 with its  stopper seal 127 removed, forming an opening 133, and ready  for use.

In all of these figures the applica  tor seal 127 is broken and the applicator is tilted so as to drop  the drug dosage form 67 adjacent an oral mucosal membrane  in the mouth of a Subject, e.g., under the tongue for Sublingual  dosage form placement. FIG. 16A shows a tube like applica  tor 129 with a handle 131 located axially under the tube 129.  FIG. 16B shows an applicator formed as a thermoform or  blister package 151 with a foil seal 135 that is peeled so as to  open the applicator package 141 prior to placing the dosage  form 67. FIG. 16C shows an applicator that is a tube 129  which is broken to break the seal prior to dosage form 67  placement. FIG. 16D shows a blister pack tube 151 type  dosage form package 141 with a handle 131 such that after the  seal 135 is peeled back the blister pack 151 can be held and  tilted to place the drug dosage form 67, on an oral mucosal  membrane. FIGS. 16E and 16F show blister pack 151 type  packaging with a handle 131 shaped like a flower or an  animal, respectively, to be used for single dose applicator 123  designed for pediatric  use.  Other single dose applicator  shapes could include cartoon characters, animals, Super-he  roes or other appropriate shapes for pediatric applications.   FIG. 18A shows a flat rigid applicator 123 with a dosage  form 67 adhered to one end, for example, by means of a  rapidly  dissolving ingestible adhesive material Such that  when the applicator end with the dosage form is placed under  the tongue, the adhesive dissolves, the dosage form 67 is  placed on an oral mucosal membrane, such as in the Sublin  gual space, and the applicator can be removed. FIG. 18B  shows an applicator 123 made from a water permeable mate  rial, impregnated with drug, forming a material and dosage  from matrix. When the impregnated end of this applicator 123  is placed under in the mouth on an oral mucosal membrane,  the moisture in the saliva dissolves the drug and delivers it  transmucosally.  FIG.  18C shows dissolving film  dosage  forms 145 and a dosage form package with a plurality of  dissolving film dosage forms 143 within it. The dissolving  film dosage form 143 is removed from the package 141 and  placed on an oral mucosal membrane, e.g., in the Sublingual  space where it dissolves and delivers the drug transmucosally.  FIGS. 19A-B provides an illustrations of two stages of use  of one embodiment of a single dose applicator 123. FIG. 19A  shows the applicator 123 in its configuration prior to use, with  two applicator tabs 147, two perforations 149, and a blister  pack 151 containing a dosage form 67.

In a typical preparation, a full  wet granulation was employed. In such a process, the alumi  num lake dye (acting as the drug Surrogate) was dissolved in  the appropriate diluent (water, EtOH or hydroalcoholic mix  tures of a number of ratios) and was added either via direct  pouring or by spraying onto the dry blend of the remaining  excipients. The wet mix was then mixed in a high-shear mixer  and processed to form granules of the desired size, in a high  shear granulator (such as the KG-5). The formed granules  were then dried in a tray oven and mixed. The final mix was  fed to a Piccola rotary press (or a beta press) equipped with  the specially designed load cell to enable the preparation of  dosage forms. To achieve that approximately 5.5-8.0 mg of  the dried granules were compressed at 1-20 KN. For some of  the examples below additional excipients, such as the binder  or the bioadhesive, were included in the solution that was  poured over the dry blend of excipients.   Further, a number of different grades and particle sizes of  mannitol can be employed to help optimize the granulation  process. In the examples provided below, the mannitol grades  were varied (Pearlitol 100SD, Pearlitol 200SD or Pearlitol  160C) obtain different quality granules (size, distribution,  etc.).   As is well-known to those skilled in the art, there is a  number of process alterations that could be used in this pro  cess. In one such alteration, a partial wet granulation was  employed to prepare dosage forms. In this process only a  portion of the excipients was used in the formation of the  granules (intra-granular mix). In such process, the remaining  excipients were added extra-granularly to the granules and  the mix would be blended for a few minutes in order to create  a homogeneous matrix. The formulation examples given  below (Table 8) also reflect partial granulation process.

The mucoadhesive testing  system  is  consisting  of a  precision  load  cell  (GS-500  Tranducer techniques, Temecula, Calif.) and a hook attach  ment. The load cell generates analogue signals, which are  converted into digital signals through a data acquisition sys  tem equipped with an A/D converter and a computer; data are  analyzed using EasyLX software (Keithley Metrabyte). A  hanging platform comprising a glass slide attached with plas  tic plunger (8 cm) on the top and a circular-steel projection  (0.5 cm) with flat surface on the bottom is attached to the load  cell. A flat-surfaced tablet die serves as a lower static-plat  form. The mucosal tissue is mounted onto the lower platform  using a screw-clamp. The hanging platform with the film is  brought down and placed over the surface of the mucosa with  a known applied force for a specified time. The detachment  force in N/cm  is determined and compared. Between each  measurement, the mucosal Surface is rinsed with 4 mL of  purified water. The excess water is wiped with a soft tissue  paper and the mucosa is wetted with a known Volume of  phosphate buffer pH 6.8. Studies are performed in triplicate at  room temperature (23-25\u00b0 C.). Adhesion and peak detach  ment force can be used to evaluate the bioadhesive strength of  dosage forms comprising various formulations of the inven  tion. A dosage form of the invention expresses bioadhesion  forces greater than 100 dynes/cm, eg 500 dynes/cm.   The bioadhesive strength of the placebo formulations was   evaluated and the results are given in Table 11.   TABLE 11   Bioadhesion force of placebo Formulations.

Drug  release from the bioadhesive transmucosal formulations were  monitored by LC/MS. The dissolution medium was defined  as phosphate buffer pH between 6.5-7.8. A dosage form of the  invention has a dissolution time that typically occurs in up to  about 60 minutes, however, in some cases dissolution is evi  dent after up to about 120 minutes or 240 minutes.

DRUG DEPOTS HAVING OFFERENT  RELEASE PROFILES FOR REDUCING,  PREVENTING OR TREATING PAN AND  NFLAMMATION   CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED  APPLICATION   This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser.  No. 12/105,994, filed Apr. 18, 2008, the entirety of which is  incorporated by reference.   10   BACKGROUND   Pain can adversely affect patients in many different ways.  It can keep the patient from being active, sleeping well, enjoy  ing family and friends, and from eating. Pain can make the  patient feel afraid or depressed and prevent full participation  in general rehabilitation programs and may even slow recov  ery.   Properpain control is of prime importance to anyone treat  ing many different diseases or conditions. Proper pain relief  imparts significant physiological and psychological benefits  to the patient. Not only does effective pain relief mean a  Smoother more pleasant recovery (e.g., mood, sleep, quality  of life, etc.) with earlier discharge from medical/surgical/  outpatient facilities,  but it  may also reduce the onset of  chronic pain syndromes (e.g., fibromyalgia, myalgia, etc.).   Pain serves the important biological function of signaling  the presence of damage or disease within the body and is often  accompanied by inflammation (redness, Swelling, anti/or  burning). There are two categories of pain: acute pain and  neuropathic pain. Acute pain refers to pain experienced when  tissue is being damaged or is damaged. Acute pain serves at  least two physiologically advantageous purposes. First,  it  warns of dangerous environmental stimuli (Such as hot or  sharp objects) by triggering reflexive responses that end con  tact with the dangerous stimuli. Second, if reflexive responses  do not avoid dangerous environmental stimuli effectively, or  tissue injury or infection otherwise results, acute pain facili  tates recuperative behaviors. For example, acute pain associ  ated with an injury or infection encourages an organism to  protect the compromised area from further insult or use while  the injury or infection heals. Once the dangerous environ  mental stimulus is removed, or the injury or infection has  resolved, acute pain, having served its physiological purpose,  ends. As contrasted to acute pain, in general, neuropathic pain  serves no beneficial purpose. Neuropathic pain results when  pain associated with an injury or infection continues in an  area once the injury or infection has resolved.   There are many painful diseases or conditions that require  proper pain and/or inflammation control, including but not  limited to rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, a spinal disc  herniation (i.e., Sciatica), carpal tunnel syndrome, lower back  pain, lower extremity pain, upper extremity pain, cancer,  tissue pain and pain associated with injury or repair of cervi  cal, thoracic, and/or lumbar vertebrae or intervertebral discs,  rotator cuff articular joint, MIT, tendons, ligaments, muscles,  spondilothesis, Stenosis, discogenic back pain, and joint pain  or the like.   One particularly painful disease is sciatica. Sciatica is a  chronic disease that often can be very debilitating and may  take a terrible toll on those with the disease as well as their  families, friends and caregivers. Sciatica is a very painful  disease associated with the Sciatic nerve, which runs from the  lower part of the spinal cord (the lumbar region), down the  back of the leg and to the foot. Sciatica generally begins with   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   2  a herniated disc, which later leads to local immune system  activation. The herniated disc also may damage the nerve root  by pinching or compressing it, leading to additional immune  system activation in the area.   Another particularly painful disease is  spinal Stenosis,  where there is progressive constriction of the spinal canal and  as it narrows, the nerve elements that reside within it become  progressively more crowded. Eventually, the canal dimen  sions become Sufficiently small-so as to significantly com  press the nerve elements and produce pain, weakness, sen  sory changes, clumsiness and other manifestation of nervous  system dysfunction. The disease causes lower back pain,  lower extremity pain, lower extremity weakness, limitation of  mobility and the high disability rates that often afflict the  elderly.   Spondylolisthesis is another painful disease. Spondylolis  thesis is a displacement disorder of the lumbar or cervical  spine, in which one vertebral body is forwardly displaced  over another vertebral body. Spondylolisthesis ma becaused  by a traumatic event or by degeneration of the spine. At times,  the displacement disorder is accompanied by or caused by a  fracture or partial collapse of one or more vertebrae or degen  eration of a disc in the spine. Patients who suffer from such  conditions can experience moderate to severe distortion of the  thoracic skeletal structure, diminished ability to bear loads,  loss of mobility, extreme and debilitating pain, and often  times Suffer neurological deficits in nerve function.   There has been considerable interest in developing effec  tive treatments for these painful diseases, yet to date current  treatments are only partially effective.   SUMMARY   Compositions and methods are provided comprising an  analgesic and/or an anti-inflammatory agent that are admin  istered in order to treat pain and/or inflammation. The pain  and/or inflammation may for example be due to chronic con  ditions including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, a spinal  discherniation (e.g., Sciatica), carpal/tarsal tunnel syndrome,  lower back pain, lower extremity pain, upper extremity pain,  cancer, tissue pain and pain associated with injury or repair of  cervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar vertebrae or intervertebral  discs, rotator cuff, articular joint, TMJ, tendons, ligaments,  muscles, spondilothesis, Stenosis, discogenic back pain, and  joint pain or the like.   One advantage of the embodiments provided herein is that  they utilize one or more drug depots or one or more drug depot  regions having a different release profile for the therapeutic  agent, which aids in the reduction, prevention or treatment of  different diseases.   In various embodiments, one or more regions of the drug  depot or one or more drug depots may be designed to release  an initial burst or bolus dose of the analgesic and/or an anti  inflammatory agent, which provides initial relief in treatment  of diseases  (e.g.,  Sciatica,  spondilothesis,  Stenosis,  etc.),  while Sustained release regions or drug depots provide Sus  tained release of the therapeutic agent over a longer period of  time. In this way more effective treatments for different dis  eases or conditions.   In one embodiment, an implantable drug depot is provided  useful for reducing, preventing or treating pain and/or inflam  mation in a patient in need of such treatment, the implantable  drug depot comprising a therapeutically effective amount of  an analgesic and/or an anti-inflammatory agent, the depot  being implantable at a site beneath the skin to reduce, prevent  or treat pain and/or inflammation, wherein the drug depot  comprises (i) at least one region capable of releasing a thera   \fUS 8,968,767 B2   3  peutically effective bolus amount of the analgesic and/or the  anti-inflammatory agent at a site beneath the skin; and (ii) at  least one region capable of releasing a therapeutically effec  tive amount of the analgesic and/or the anti-inflammatory  agent over a period of at least three days.   In another embodiment, a kit is provided comprising a  plurality of implantable drug depots useful for reducing, pre  venting or treating pain and/or inflammation in a patient in  need of Such treatment, the kit comprising a first set of the  plurality of drug depots capable of releasing atherapeutically  effective bolus amount of an analgesic and/or an anti-inflam  matory agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof at  a site beneath the skin and a second set of the plurality of drug  depots capable of releasingatherapeutically effective amount  of the analgesic and/or the anti-inflammatory agent or phar  maceutically acceptable salts thereof over a period of at least  three days. In various embodiments, by implanting different  sets of drug depot with different release profiles, the need to  develop one set of drug depots with the desired immediate  release and Sustained release properties is avoided.   In one exemplary embodiment, a method of reducing, pre  venting or treating pain and/or inflammation in a patient in  need of Such treatment is provided, the method comprising  administering a plurality of implantable drug depots at or near  a target tissue site of the patient, wherein a first set of the  plurality of drug depots is capable of releasing a therapeuti  cally effective bolus amount of an analgesic and/or an anti  inflammatory agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salts  thereof at a site beneath the skin and a second set of the  plurality of drug depots is capable of releasing a therapeuti  cally effective amount of the analgesic and/or the anti-inflam  matory agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof  over a period of at least three days.   In another exemplary embodiment, a plurality of implant  able drug depots is proved that are useful for reducing, pre  venting or treating pain and/or inflammation in a patient in  need of such treatment, the plurality of drug depots compris  ing a first set of one or more drug depots capable of releasing  a therapeutically effective bolus dose of an analgesic and/or  an anti-inflammatory agent or pharmaceutically acceptable  salts thereof at a site beneath the skin and a second set of one  or more drug depots capable of releasing a therapeutically  effective amount of the analgesic and/or the anti-inflamma  tory agent orpharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof over a  period of at least three days.

Thus, a drug depot may comprise a  physical structure to facilitate implantation and retention in a  desired site (e.g., a disc space, a spinal canal, a tissue of the  patient, particularly at or near a site of surgery, pain, or site of  inflammation, etc.). The drug depot also comprises the drug  itself. The term \"drug\u201d as used herein is generally meant to  refer to any Substance that alters the physiology of a patient.  The term \u201cdrug  may be used interchangeably herein with the  terms  \u201ctherapeutic  agent,\u201d  \u201ctherapeutically  effective  amount,\u201d and \u201cactive pharmaceutical ingredient\u2019 or API.  It  will be understood that unless otherwise specified a \u201cdrug  formulation may include more than one therapeutic agent,  wherein  exemplary  combinations  of therapeutic  agents  include a combination of two or more drugs. The drug pro  vides a concentration gradient of the therapeutic agent for  delivery to the site. In various embodiments, the drug depot  provides an optimal drug concentration gradient of the thera  peutic agent at a distance of up to about 0.1 cm to about 5 cm  from the implant site, and comprises at least one anti-inflam  matory agent or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt and at  least one analgesic agent or its pharmaceutically acceptable  salt.   A \u201cdepot' includes but is not limited to capsules, micro  spheres, microparticles, microcapsules, microfibers particles,  nanospheres, nanoparticles, coating, matrices, wafers, pills,  pellets, emulsions, liposomes, micelles, gels, or other phar  maceutical delivery compositions or a combination thereof.  Suitable materials for the depot are ideally pharmaceutically  acceptable biodegradable and/or any bioabsorbable materials  that are preferably FDA approved or GRAS materials. These  materials can be polymeric or non-polymeric, as well as  synthetic or naturally occurring, or a combination thereof.   A \u201ctherapeutically  effective  amount\u2019  or  \u201ceffective  amount' is such that when administered, the drug results in  alteration of the biological activity, Such as, for example,  inhibition of inflammation, reduction or alleviation of pain,  improvement in the condition through muscle relaxation, etc.  The dosage administered to a patient can unless otherwise  specified or apparent from context be as single or multiple  doses depending upon a variety of factors, including the  drug's administered pharmacokinetic properties, the route of   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   8  administration, patient conditions and characteristics (sex,  age, body weight, health, size, etc.), extent of symptoms,  concurrent treatments, frequency of treatment and the effect  desired. In some embodiments the formulation is designed for  immediate release. In other embodiments the formulation is  designed for Sustained release. In other embodiments, the  formulation comprises one or more immediate release Sur  faces and one or more Sustain release Surfaces.   The phrases \u201csustained release' or \u201csustain release' (also  referred to as extended release or controlled release) are used  herein to refer to one or more therapeutic agent(s) that is  introduced into the body of a human or other mammal and  continuously or continually releases a stream of one or more  therapeutic agents over a predetermined time period and at a  therapeutic level sufficient to achieve a desired therapeutic  effect throughout the predetermined time period. Reference  to a continuous or continual release stream is intended to  encompass release that occurs as the result of biodegradation  in vivo of the drug depot, or a matrix or component thereof, or  as the result of metabolic transformation or dissolution of the  therapeutic agent(s) or conjugates of therapeutic agent(s). As  persons of ordinary skill are aware, Sustained release formu  lations may, by way of example, be created as films, slabs,  pellets, microparticles, microspheres, microcapsules, sphe  roids, shaped derivatives and paste. The formulations may be  in form that is  suitable for Suspension in isotonic saline,  physiological buffer or other solution acceptable for injection  into a patient. Further, the formulations may be used in con  junction with any implantable, insertable or injectable system  that a person of ordinary skill would appreciate as useful in  connection with embodiments herein including but not lim  ited to parenteral formulations, microspheres, microcapsules,  gels, pastes, implantable rods, pellets, plates or fibers, etc.   The phrase \u201cimmediate release' is used herein to refer to  one or more therapeutic agent(s) that is introduced into the  body and that is allowed to dissolve in or become absorbed at  the location to which it is administered, with no intention of  delaying or prolonging the dissolution or absorption of the  drug. Immediate release refers to the release of drug within a  short time period following administration, e.g., generally  within a few minutes to about 1 to 2 hours.   The term \u201cmammal\u2019 refers to organisms from the tax  onomy class  \u201cmammalian,  including but not limited to  humans, other primates such as chimpanzees, apes, orangu  tans and monkeys, rats, mice, cats, dogs, cows, horses, etc. In  various embodiments, the mammal is a human patient.   The phrase \u201crelease rate profile' refers to the percentage of  active ingredient that is released over fixed units of time, e.g.,  mcg/hr, mcg/day, mg/hr, mg/day, 10% per day for ten days,  etc. As persons of ordinary skill know, a release rate profile  may be but need not be linear.  By way of a non-limiting  example, the drug depot may be a pellet that releases at least  one analgesic agent in a bolus dose and at least one anti  inflammatory agent over a period of time.   Treating or treatment of a disease or condition refers to  executing a protocol, which may include administering one or  more drugs to a patient (human, normal or otherwise, or other  mammal), in an effort to alleviate signs or symptoms of the  disease. Alleviation can occur prior to signs or symptoms of  the disease or condition appearing, as well as after their  appearance. Thus, \u201ctreating  or \u201ctreatment\u201d includes \u201cpre  venting  or \u201cprevention  of disease or undesirable condition.  In addition, \u201ctreating  or \u201ctreatment\u201d does not require com  plete alleviation of signs or symptoms, does not require a  cure, and specifically includes protocols that have only a  marginal effect on the patient. \"Reducing pain' includes a  decrease in pain and does not require complete alleviation of   \fUS 8,968,767 B2   9  pain signs or symptoms, and does not require a cure.  In  various embodiments, reducing pain includes even a marginal  decrease in pain. By way of example, the administration of  the effective dosages of at least one analgesic agent and at  least one anti-inflammatory agent may be used to prevent,  treat or relieve the symptoms of pain and/or inflammation.   \u201cLocalized  delivery includes delivery where one or more  drugs are deposited within a tissue, for example, a nerve root  of the nervous system or a region of the brain, or in close  proximity (within about 10 cm, or preferably within about 5  cm, or within about 1  cm, or less for example) thereto. A  \u201ctargeted delivery system' provides delivery of one or more  drugs depots, gels or depot dispersed in the gel having a  quantity of therapeutic agent that can be deposited at or near  the target site as needed for treatment of pain, inflammation or  other disease or condition.   The term \u201cbiodegradable' includes that all or parts of the  drug depot degrade over time by the action of enzymes, by  hydrolytic action and/or by other similar mechanisms in the  human body.  In  various  embodiments,  \u201cbiodegradable'  includes that the depot (e.g., microparticle, microsphere, etc.)  can break down or degrade within the body to non-toxic  components after or while a therapeutic agent has been or is  being released. By \u201cbioerodible' it is meant that the depot  will erode or degrade over time due, at least in part, to contact  with Substances found in the Surrounding tissue, fluids or by  cellular action. By \u201cbioabsorbable' it is meant that the depot  will be broken down and absorbed within the human body, for  example, by a cell or tissue. \u201cBiocompatible\u201d means that the  depot will not cause Substantial tissue irritation or necrosis at  the target tissue site.   The phrase \u201cpain management medication\u201d includes one or  more therapeutic agents that are administered to prevent,  alleviate or remove pain entirely. These include anti-inflam  matory agents, muscle relaxants, analgesics, anesthetics, nar  cotics, and so forth, and combinations thereof.   In various embodiments, the depot can be designed to  cause an initial burst dose of one or more therapeutic agents  within the first 24 hours after implantation. \u201cInitial burst' or  \u201cburst effect\u201d or \u201cbolus dose\u201d or \u201cpulse dose\u201d refer to the  release of therapeutic agent from the depot during the first 24  hours after the depot comes in contact with an aqueous fluid  (e.g., synovial fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, etc.). The burst  effect  may be an mediate release.  The \u201cburst effect\u201d  is  believed to be due to the increased release of therapeutic agent  from the depot. The initial burst effect or bolus dose may be  determined before hand by formulating the depot by calcu  lating the quotient obtained by dividing (i)  the effective  amount by weight of therapeutic agent to be released from the  depot or region in a predetermined initial period of time after  implantation of the depot, by (ii) the total amount of thera  peutic agent that is to be delivered from an implanted com  position.  It  is  understood that  the initial  burst may vary  depending on the shape and Surface area of the implant.   The burst effect with respect to the region or depot, in  various embodiments, can be designed so that a larger initial  dose may be released over a short period of time to achieve the  desired effect. For example, if a drug depot is designed to  release 15 mg of morphine per 48 hours, then the initial burst  dose or bolus dose region or depot will be designed to release  a percentage of the dose within the first 24 hours 10 mg of  morphine or 66% of the 48 hour dose within 24 hours). Thus,  the burst effect of the drug depot or region releases more  therapeutic agent than the Sustained release region or depot.  A region or depot that utilizes a burst effect or bolus dose  will release more therapeutic agent (e.g., analgesic and/or  anti-inflammatory) than the Sustained release region or depot.   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   10  For example, particularly with painful chronic conditions  including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, a spinal disc  herniation  (e.g.,  Sciatica),  carpal/tarsal  tunnel  syndrome,  lower back pain, lower extremity pain, upper extremity pain,  cancer, tissue pain and pain associated with injury or repair of  cervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar vertebrae or intervertebral  discs, rotator cuff, articular joint, TMJ, tendons, ligaments,  muscles, spondilothesis, Stenosis, discogenic back pain, and  joint pain or the like, the initial burst effect of the drug depot  or region of the drug depot will be advantageous as it will  provide more immediate pain and/or inflammation relief as a  bolus dose of drug will be released at or near the target tissue  site and provide the desired reducing, oralleviation of signs or  symptoms of pain and/or inflammation. For example, the  drug depot or region of the drug depot may release 51%, 52%,  53%, 54%, 55%, 9% 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%,  63%, 64%. 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%,  73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%,  83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%,  93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% of the daily  dose within the first one to twelve hours to reduce, prevent or  treat pain and/or inflammation. The pain and/or inflammation  may also be due to Surgery.   The drug depot comprising at least one analgesic agent or  its pharmaceutically acceptable salt and at least one anti  inflammatory agent or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt  may be co-administered with a muscle relaxant. Co-admin  istration may involve administering at the same time in sepa  rate drug depots or formulating together in the same drug  depot.   Exemplary muscle relaxants include by way of example  and not limitation, alcuronium chloride, atracurium bescy  late, baclofen, carbolonium, carisoprodol, chlorphenesin car  bamate, chlorZoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, dantrolene, deca  methonium bromide,  fazadinium,  gallamine  triethiodide,  hexafluorenium,  meladrazine,  mephensin,  metaxalone,  methocarbamol, metocurine iodide, pancuronium, pridinol  mesylate,  styramate,  suxamethonium, SuXethonium, thio  colchicoside, tizanidine, tolperisone, tubocuarine, vecuro  nium, or combinations thereof.

The drug depot may  release an initial burst dose or bolus dose or pulse dose or  immediate release dose based on the daily dosage. The drug  depot may release a longer Sustained release dose based on  the daily dosage.   The at least one anti-inflammatory agent and at least one  analgesic agent may also be administered with non-active  ingredients. These non-active ingredients may have multi  functional purposes including the carrying, stabilizing and  controlling the release of the therapeutic agent(s). The Sus  tained release process, for example, may be by a solution  diffusion mechanism or it may be governed by an erosion  sustained process. Typically, the depot will be a solid or  semi-solid formulation comprised of a biocompatible mate  rial that can be biodegradable. The term \"solid  is intended to  mean a rigid material, while 'semi-solid  is intended to mean  a material that has some degree of flexibility, thereby allow  ing the depot to bend and conform to the Surrounding tissue  requirements.   In various embodiments, the non-active ingredients will be  durable within the tissue site for a period of time equal to (for  biodegradable components) or greater than (for non-biode  gradable components) the planned period of drug delivery.  For example, the depot material may have a melting point or  glass transition temperature close to or higher than body  temperature, but lower than the decomposition or degradation  temperature of the therapeutic agent. However, the pre-deter  mined erosion of the depot material can also be used to  provide for slow release of the loaded therapeutic agent(s).   In various embodiments, the drug depot may not be biode  gradable or comprise material that is not biodegradable. Non  biodegradable polymers include, but are not limited to, vari  ous cellulose derivatives (carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose  acetate, cellulose acetate propionate, ethyl cellulose, hydrox  ypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxyalkyl methyl celluloses,  and alkyl  celluloses),  silicon and silicon-based polymers  (such  as  polydimethylsiloxane),  polyethylene-co-(vinyl  acetate),  poloxamer,  polyvinylpyrrolidone,  poloxamine,  polypropylene, polyamide, polyacetal, polyester, polyethyl  ene-chlorotrifluoroethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE  or  \u201cTeflonTM,  styrene  butadiene  rubber,  polyethylene,  polypropylene, polyphenylene oxide-polystyrene, poly-C.-  chloro-p-Xylene, polymethylpentene, polysulfone, non-de  gradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (e.g., ethylene vinyl acetate  disks and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate)), and other related  biostable polymers or combinations thereof.   The drug depot may comprise nun-resorbable polymers as  well. These non-resorbable polymers can include, but are not  limited to, delrin, polyurethane, copolymers of silicone and   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   16  polyurethane, polyolefins (such as polyisobutylene and poly  isoprene), acrylamides (such as polyacrylic acid and poly  (acrylonitrile-acrylic acid)), neoprene, nitrile, acrylates (such  as polyacrylates, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), methyl  methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and copolymers  of acrylates with N-vinyl pyrrolidone), lactams, polyacry  lonitrile, glucomannan gel, Vulcanized rubber and combina  tions thereof Examples of polyurethanes include thermoplas  tic  polyurethanes,  aliphatic  polyurethanes,  segmented  polyurethanes,  hydrophilic  polyurethanes,  polyether-ure  thane, polycarbonate-urethane and silicone polyether-ure  thane. Typically, the non-degradable drug depots may need to  be removed.   In some instance, it may be desirable to avoid having to  remove the drug depot after use. In those instances, the depot  may comprise a biodegradable material. There are numerous  materials available for this purpose and having the character  istic of being able to breakdown or disintegrate over a pro  longed period of time when positioned at or near the target  tissue. As a function of the chemistry of the biodegradable  material, the mechanism of the degradation process can be  hydrolytical or enzymatical in nature, or both. In various  embodiments, the degradation can occur either at the Surface  (heterogeneous or Surface erosion) or uniformly throughout  the drug delivery system depot (homogeneous or bulk ero  sion).   In various embodiments, the depot may comprise a bioab  sorbable, and/or a biodegradable biopolymer that may pro  vide immediate release, or Sustained release of the at least one  analgesic agent and at least one anti-inflammatory agent.  Examples of suitable sustained release biopolymers include  but are not limited to poly (alpha-hydroxy acids), poly (lac  tide-co-glycolide) (PLGA or PLG) polylactide (PLA), polyg  lycolide (PG), polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugates of poly  (alpha-hydroxy acids), polyorthoesters, polyaspirins, poly  phosphagenes,  collagen,  starch,  pre-gelatinized  starch,  hyaluronic acid, chitosans, gelatin, alginates, albumin, fibrin,  Vitamin E analogs, such as alpha tocopheryl acetate, d-alpha  tocopheryl Succinate,  D.L-lactide, or L-lactide, poly(gly  collide-,-caprolactone), -caprolactone, dextrans, vinylpyrroli  done, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA-g-PLGA, PEGT-PBT  copolymer (polyactive),  methacrylates,  poly(N-isopropy  lacrylamide), PEO-PPO-PEO (pluronics), PEO-PPO-PAA  copolymers, PLGA-PEO-PLGA, PEG-PLO, PLA-PLGA,  poloxamer  407,  PEG-PLGA-PEG  triblock  copolymers,  SAIB (sucrose acetate isobutyrate) or combinations thereof.  As persons of ordinary skill are aware, mPEG may be used as  a plasticizer for PLGA, but other polymers/excipients may be  used to achieve the same effect. mPEG imparts malleability to  the resulting formulations.   Where different combinations of polymers are used (bi, tri  (e.g., PLGA-PEO-PLGA) or terpolymers), they may be used  in different molar ratios, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1,  9:1, or 10:1. For example, for a 130-day release drug depot,  the polymer make up is  50:50 PLGA to  100 PLA. The  molecular weight range is 0.45 to 0.8 dI/g.   In various embodiments, the molecular weight of the poly  mer can be a wide range of values. The average molecular  weight of the polymer can be from about 1000 to about  10,000,000; or about 1,000 to about 1,000,000; or about  5,000 to about 500,000; or about 10,000 to about 100,000; or  about 20,000 to 50,000.   In some embodiments, the at least one biodegradable poly  mer comprises poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLA) or poly  (orthoester) (POE) or a combination thereof. The polylactic  co-glycolic acid) may comprise a mixture of polyglycolide  (PGA) and polylactide and in some embodiments, in the   \fUS 8,968,767 B2   17  mixture, there is more polylactide than polyglycolide. In Vari  ous other embodiments there is  100% polylactide and 0%  polyglycolide: 95% polylactide and 5% polyglycolide: 90%  polylactide and 10% polyglycolide: 85% polylactide and  15% polyglycolide; 80% polylactide and 20% polyglycolide;  75% polylactide and 25% polyglycolide; 70% polylactide  and 30% polyglycolide: 65% polylactide and 35% polygly  collide; 60% polylactide and 40% polyglycolide; 55% poly  lactide and 45% polyglycolide; 50% polylactide and 50%  polyglycolide; 45% polylactide and 55% polyglycolide; 40%  polylactide and 60% polyglycolide: 35% polylactide and  65% polyglycolide; 30% polylactide and 70% polyglycolide;  25% polylactide and 75% polyglycolide; 20% polylactide  and 80% polyglycolide; 15% polylactide and 85% polygly  collide; 10% polylactide and 90% polyglycolide; 5% polylac  tide and 95% polyglycolide; and 0% polylactide and 100%  polyglycolide.   In various embodiments that comprise both polylactide  and polyglycolide; there is at least 95% polylactide; at least  90% polylactide; at least 85% polylactide; at least 80% poly  lactide; at least 75% polylactide; at least 70% polylactide; at  least 65% polylactide; at least 60% polylactide; at least 55%;  at least 50% polylactide; at least 45% polylactide; at least  40% polylactide; at least 35% polylactide; at least 30% poly  lactide; at least 25% polylactide; at least 20% polylactide; at  least 15% polylactide; at least 10% polylactide; or at least 5%  polylactide;  and the  remainder of the biopolymer being  polyglycolide.   In some embodiments, the biodegradable polymer com  prises at least 10 wt %, at least 50 wt.%, at least 60 wt %, at  least 70 wt.%, at least 80 wt.%, at least 85 wt.%, at least 90  wt.%, at least 95 or at least 99 wt.% of the formulation. In  Some embodiments, the at least one biodegradable polymer  and the analgesic and the anti-inflammatory are the only  components of the pharmaceutical formulation.   In some embodiments, at least 75% of the particles have a  size from about 1 micrometer to about 250 micrometers. In  some embodiments, at least 85% of the particles have a size  from about 1 micrometer to about 100 micrometers. In some  embodiments, at least 95% of the particles have a size from  about  1  micrometer to  about 30 micrometers.  In  some  embodiments, all of the particles have a size from about 1  micrometer to about 30 micrometers.   In some embodiments, at least 75% of the particles have a  size from about 5 micrometer to about 20 micrometers. In  some embodiments, at least 85% of the particles have a size  from about 5 micrometers to about 20 micrometers. In some  embodiments, at least 95% of the particles have a size from  about  5  micrometer to  about 20 micrometers.  In  some  embodiments, all of the particles have a size from about 5  micrometer to about 250 micrometers.   The depot may optionally contain inactive materials such  as buffering agents and pH adjusting agents such as potas  sium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium hydrox  ide,  Sodium acetate, Sodium borate,  sodium bicarbonate,  Sodium carbonate, Sodium hydroxide or Sodium phosphate:  degradation/release modifiers; drug release adjusting agents;  emulsifiers; preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride,  chlorobutanol, phenylmercuric acetate and phenylmercuric  nitrate, sodium bisulfite, sodium bisulfate, sodium thiosul  fate, thimerosal, methylparaben, polyvinyl alcohol and phe  nylethyl alcohol; solubility adjusting agents; stabilizers; and/  or cohesion modifiers. Typically, any such inactive materials  will be present within the range of 0-75 wt %, and more  typically within the range of 0-30 wt.%. If the depot is to be  placed in the spinal area, in various embodiments, the depot  may comprise sterile preservative free material.   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   18  The depot can be different sizes, shapes and configura  tions. There are several factors that can be taken into consid  eration in determining the size, shape and configuration of the  drug depot. For example, both the size and shape may allow  for ease in positioning the drug depot at the target tissue site  that is selected as the implantation or injection site. In addi  tion, the shape and size of the system should be selected so as  to minimize or prevent the drug depot from moving after  implantation or injection. In various embodiments, the drug  depot can be shaped like a pellet, a sphere, a cylinder Such as  a rod or fiber, a flat surface such as a disc, film or sheet, or the  like.  Flexibility may be a consideration so as to facilitate  placement of the drug depot. In various embodiments, the  drug depot can be different sizes, for example, the drug depot  may be a length of from about 0.5 mm to 5 mm and have a  diameter of from about 0.01  to  about 2 mm. In various  embodiments, the drug depot may have a layer thickness of  from about 0.005 to 1.0 mm, such as, for example, from 0.05  to 0.75 mm.   Radiographic markers can be included on the drug depot to  permit the user to position the depot accurately into the target  site of the patient. These radiographic markers will also per  mit the user to track movement and degradation of the depot  at the site over time, in this embodiment, the user may accu  rately position the depot in the site using any of the numerous  diagnostic imaging procedures. Such diagnostic imaging pro  cedures include, for example, X-ray imaging or fluoroscopy.  Examples of Such radiographic markers include, but are not  limited to, barium, calcium phosphate, and/or metal beads or  particles. In various embodiments, the radiographic marker  could be a spherical shape or a ring around the depot.   FIG. 1 is a schematic drawing illustrating an embodiment  of one drug depot 10 composition having a first region or layer  12 capable of releasing a  therapeutically  effective burst  amount or bolus dose or pulse dose or immediate release of  the analgesic and/or the anti-inflammatory agent as the depot  comes in contact with the bodily fluid and the layer or region  degrades and releases the therapeutic agent(s). In this way,  short-term relief of pain and/or inflammation can be provided  to the patient. A second layer or region (shown as the core) of  the depot shown as 14 is capable of releasingatherapeutically  effective amount of the analgesic and the anti-inflammatory  agent over a longer period of time (e.g., at least 3 days to 6  months) as this region or layer comes into contact with bodily  fluid.   Although the initial burst region or layer is shown sepa  rately from the sustained release layer, it will be understood  that the initial burst region or layer may be combined with the  Sustained release region or layer and thus when fluid contacts  the depot each layer will release at different release rates. It  will also be understood that, although the depot is shown with  two layers or regions (12 and 14), the depot may comprise one  or multiple layers or regions (e.g., two, three, four, five, six,  seven, eight, nine ten, etc.). For example, a first immediate  release layer or region may be disposed on a first Sustained  release layer and a second immediate release layer may be  disposed on the first Sustained release layer, and so on. It will  also be understood that the depot may be formed from a  mixture of a sustained release formulation with a burst release  formulation that are combined together.   For example, the depot may be formed from separate dif  ferent micelles (one or more bolus release micelle and one or  more Sustained release micelles) having different release pro  files that are combined together. In various embodiments, the  plurality of depots may comprise biodegradable therapeutic  particles dispersed within a gel and as the gel degrades, the  therapeutic particles are released.   \fUS 8,968,767 B2   19  FIG. 1A is a schematic drawing illustrating an embodiment  of one drug depot composition 10 having a plurality  of  regions 12 capable of releasing a therapeutically effective  burst amount or bolus dose or pulse dose or immediate release  of the analgesic and/or the anti-inflammatory agent as the  region degrades when it comes into contact with bodily fluid.  Region 14 is capable of releasing a therapeutically effective  amount of the analgesic and the anti-inflammatory agent over  alonger period of time (Sustained release over a longer period  of time) as the region degrades when it comes into contact  with bodily fluid.   FIG. 2 is a schematic drawing illustrating an embodiment  of one drug depot composition having a plurality of regions  12 capable of releasing a therapeutically effective a burst  amount or bolus dose or pulse dose or immediate release of  the  analgesic  and/or the anti-inflammatory  agent,  when  bodily fluids come in contact with the region. A plurality of  regions 14 are provided and are capable of releasing a thera  peutically effective amount of the analgesic and the anti  inflammatory agent over a longer period of time, when bodily  fluid come in contact with these regions. The regions 12 and  14 may be housed in the drug depot housing 16, which also  may be biodegradable as well as the regions.   FIG. 3 is a schematic drawing illustrating an embodiment  of a plurality of drug depots, a first set of drug depots 12  capable of releasing a therapeutically effective burst amount  or bolus dose or pulse dose or immediate release of the anal  gesic and/or the anti-inflammatory agent and a plurality of  regions 14 capable of releasing a therapeutically effective  amount of the analgesic and the anti-inflammatory agent over  a longer period of time (Sustained release). Thus, in this  embodiment, there is a set of drug depots. One set may have  a burst release or bolus release or pulse release or immediate  release and the other set may be Sustained release over a  longer period of time. Thus, the first and second depot set  have different release profiles. In this embodiment, a number  of pellets  for different diseases/conditions (e.g.,  Sciatica,  post-operative pain etc.) with various drug release kinetics,  some with fast release and other with slow release can be  implanted together thus avoiding the need for one drug depot  with complicated release kinetics. In conditions, for example,  post-operative pain, one can implant 3-5 strips at the Surgical  site in one patient at a time to reduce, prevent or treat post  operative pain.   A strategy of triangulation may be effective when admin  istering these multiple depot pharmaceutical formulations.  Thus, a plurality (at least two, at least three, at least four, at  least five, at least six, at least seven, etc.) drug depots com  prising  the  pharmaceutical  formulations  may be placed  around the target tissue site (also known as the pain generator  or pain generation site such that the target tissue site falls  within a region that is either between the formulations when  there are two, or within an area whose perimeter is defined by  a set of plurality of formulations.   Various factors can be adjusted to achieve the initial burst  of therapeutic agent release. First, the initial burst can be  controlled by factors related to the property of the depot, such  as the water immiscibility of the solvent, polymer/solvent  ratio, and the property of the polymer. The extent of water  immiscibility of the solvent used in the depot affects that rate  aqueous body fluid can penetrate the depot to release the  therapeutic agent. Generally, higher water solubility leads to  a higher initial burst while water immiscibility leads to a  lower initial burst or slower release (sustained release) of the  therapeutic agent.   Suitable solvents that can be used to control initial burst  release or Sustained release include, but are not limited to,   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   20  methylbenzoate, ethylbenzoate, n-propylbenzoate, isopro  pyl benzoate, butylbenzoate, isobutylbenzoate, sec-butyl  benzoate, tert-butylbenzoate, isoamylbenzoate, benzylben  Zoate, water, alcohol, low molecular weight PEG (less than  1,000 MW), triacetin, diacetin, tributyrin, triethyl citrate,  tributyl citrate, acetyl triethyl citrate, acetyl tributyl citrate,  triethylglycerides,  triethyl  phosphate,  diethyl  phthalate,  diethyl tartrate, mineral oil, polybutene, silicone fluid, glyc  erin, ethylene glycol, octanol, ethyl lactate, propylene glycol,  propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, butyrolactone, eth  ylene  oxide,  propylene  oxide,  N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone,  2-pyrrolidone, glycerol formal, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate,  methyl ethyl ketone, dimethylformamide, glycofurol, dim  ethyl Sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, caprolactam, decylmethyl  Sulfoxide,  oleic acid,  1-dodecylazacyclo-heptan-2-one, or  mixtures  thereof. The solvent can be mixed, in  various  embodiments, with the therapeutic agent and/or polymers to  obtain the desired release profile.   The depot may have pore forming agents, which include  biocompatible materials that when contacted with body fluids  dissolve, disperse or degrade to create pores or channels in the  polymer matrix. Typically, organic and non-organic materials  that are water soluble such as Sugars (e.g., Sucrose, dextrose),  water soluble salts (e.g., Sodium chloride, Sodium phosphate,  potassium chloride, and Sodium carbonate), water soluble  solvents such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and polyethylene  glycol and water soluble polymers (e.g., carboxymethylcel  lulose, hydroxypropyl-cellulose, and the like) can conve  niently be used as pore formers. Such materials may be  presentinamounts varying from about 0.1% to about 100% of  the weight of the polymer, but will typically be less than 50%  and more typically less than 10-20% of the weight of poly   C.  Further, varying the molecular weight of the polymer in the  depot, or adjusting the molecular weight distribution of the  polymer material in the depot vehicle can affect the initial  burst and the release rate of therapeutic agent from the depot.  Generally, a higher molecular weight polymer renders a  lower initial burst and slower release rate of the therapeutic  agent. The polymers may have different end groups such as  acid and ester end groups. As persons of ordinary skill in the  art are aware, implantable elastomeric depot compositions  having a blend of polymers with different end groups are used  the resulting formulation will have a lower burst index and a  regulated duration of delivery. For example, one may use  polymers with acid (e.g.,  carboxylic acid) and ester end  groups (e.g., methyl of ethyl ester end groups).   Additionally, by varying the comonomer ratio of the vari  ous monomers that form a polymer (e.g., the L/G (lactic  acid/glycolic acid) or G/CL (glycolic acid/polycaprolactone)  ratio for a given polymer) there will be a resulting depot  composition having a regulated burst index and duration of  delivery. For example, a depot composition having a polymer  with a L/Gratio of 50:50 may have a short duration of delivery  ranging from about two days to about one month; a depot  composition having a polymer with a L/G ratio of 65:35 may  have a duration of delivery of about two months; a depot  composition having a polymer with a L/G ratio of 75:25 or  L/CL ratio of 75:25 may have a duration of delivery of about  three months to about four months; a depot composition  having a polymer ratio with a L/G ratio of 85:15 may have a  duration of delivery of about five months; a depot composi  tion having a polymer with a L/CL ratio of 25:75 or PLA may  have a duration of delivery greater than or equal to six  months; a depot composition having a terpolymer of CL/G/L  with G greater than 50% and L. greater than 10% may have a  duration of delivery of about one month and a depot compo   \fUS 8,968,767 B2   21  sition having a terpolymer of CL/G/L with Gless than 50%  and L. less than 10% may have a duration months up to six  months. In general, increasing the G content relative to the CL  content shortens the duration of delivery whereas increasing  the CL content relative to the G content lengthens the duration  of delivery. Thus, among other things, depot compositions  having  a blend of polymers having different  molecular  weights, end groups and comonomer ratios can be used to  create a depot formulation having a lower burst index and a  regulated duration of delivery.   Factors such as the particle size, the disintegration of the  particulates, the morphology of the particulates (e.g., whether  pores are present in the particulates before implanting or can  be formed easily by body fluid attack), coatings, complex  formation by the therapeutic agent and the strength of com  plex bond, can be manipulated to achieve the desired low  initial burst and release rate.   In various embodiments, the drug depot comprises poly  (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), polylactide (PLA), polygly  collide (PGA), D-lactide, D.L-lactide, L-lactide, D.L-lactide  e-caprolactone,  D.L-lactide-glycolide-e-caprolactone,  glycolide-caprolactone or a combination thereof.   Gel  In various embodiments, the gel has a pre-dosed viscosity  in the range of about 1  to about 500 centipoise (cps), 1  to  about 200 cps, or 1 to about 100 cps. After the gel is admin  istered to the target site, the viscosity of the gel will increase  and the gel will have a modulus of elasticity (Young's modu  lus) in the range of about 1x10\" to about 6x10dynes/cm, or  2x10  to about 5x10  dynes/cm, or 5x10  to about 5x10  dynes/cm.   In one embodiment, a depot comprises an adherent gel  comprising at least one analgesic agent and at least one anti  inflammatory agent that is evenly distributed throughout the  gel. The gel may be of any Suitable type, as previously indi  cated, and should be sufficiently viscous So as to prevent the  gel from migrating from the targeted delivery  site  once  deployed; the gel should, in effect, \u201cstick\u201d or adhere to the  targeted tissue site. The gel may, for example, Solidify upon  contact with the targeted tissue or after deployment from a  targeted delivery system. The targeted delivery system may  be, for example, a Syringe, a catheter, needle or cannula or any  other suitable device. The targeted delivery system may inject  the gel into or on the targeted tissue site. Thetherapeutic agent  may be mixed into the gel prior to the gel being deployed at  the targeted tissue site. In various embodiments, the gel may  be part of a two-component delivery system and when the two  components are mixed, a chemical process is activated to  form the gel and cause it to Stick or to adhere to the target  tissue.   In various embodiments, a gel is provided that hardens or  stiffens after delivery. Typically, hardening gel formulations  may have a pre-dosed modulus of elasticity in the range of  about 1x10\" to about 3x10  dynes/cm, or 2x10  to about  2x10 dynes/cm, or 5x10\" to about 1x10 dynes/cm. The  post-dosed hardening gels (after delivery) may have a rubbery  consistency and have a modulus of elasticity in the range of  about 1x10\" to about 2x 10\u00b0 dynes/cm, or 1x10  to about  7x10dynes/cm, or 2x10 to about 5x10 dynes/cm.   In various embodiments, for those gel formulations that  contain a polymer, the polymer concentration may affect the  rate at which the gel hardens (e.g., a gel with a higher con  centration of polymer may coagulate more quickly than gels  having a lower concentration of polymer). In various embodi  ments, when the gel hardens, the resulting matrix is solid but  is also able to conform to the irregular surface of the tissue  (e.g., recesses and/or projections in bone).   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   22  The percentage of polymer present in the gel may also  affect  the  viscosity  of the  polymeric  composition.  For  example, a composition having a higher percentage by weight  of polymer is typically thicker and more viscous than a com  position having a lower percentage by weight of polymer. A  more viscous composition tends to flow more slowly. There  fore, a composition having a lower viscosity may be preferred  in some instances.   In various embodiments, the molecular weight of the gel  can be varied by any one of the many methods known in the  art. The choice of method to vary molecular weight is typi  cally determined by the composition of the gel (e.g., polymer  Versus non-polymer). For example in various embodiments,  when the gel comprises one or more polymers, the degree of  polymerization can be controlled by varying the amount of  polymer initiators (e.g. benzoyl peroxide), organic solvents  or activator (e.g. DMPT), crosslinking agents, polymeriza  tion agent, and/or reaction time.   Suitable gel polymers may be soluble in an organic solvent.  The solubility of a polymer in a solvent varies depending on  the  crystallinity,  hydrophobicity,  hydrogen-bonding  and  molecular weight of the polymer. Lower molecular weight  polymers will normally dissolve more readily in an organic  Solvent than high-molecular weight polymers. A polymeric  gel, which includes a high molecular weight polymer, tends to  coagulate or Solidify more quickly than a polymeric compo  sition, which includes a low-molecular weight polymer. Poly  meric gel formulations, which include high molecular weight  polymers, also tend to have a higher Solution viscosity than a  polymeric gel, which include a low-molecular weight poly   C.  When the gel is designed to be a flow-able gel, it can vary  from low viscosity, similar to that of water, to a high Viscosity,  similar to that of a paste, depending on the molecular weight  and concentration of the polymer used in the gel. The Viscos  ity of the gel can be varied such that the polymeric composi  tion can be applied to a patient's tissues by any convenient  technique, for example, by brushing, dripping, injecting, or  painting. Different viscosities of the gel will depend on the  technique used to apply the composition.   In various embodiments, the gel has an inherent viscosity  (abbreviated as \u201cI.V.  and units are in deciliters/gram), which  is a measure of the gel's molecular weight and degradation  time (e.g., a gel with a high inherent viscosity has a higher  molecular weight and longer degradation time). Typically, a  gel with a high molecular weight provides a stronger matrix  and the matrix takes more time to degrade. In contrast, a gel  with a low molecular weight degrades more quickly and  provides a softer matrix. In various embodiments, the gel has  a molecular weight, as shown by the inherent Viscosity, from  about 0.10 dL/g to about 1.2dL/g or from about 0.10 dL/g to  about 0.40 dL/g.   In various embodiments, the gel can have a viscosity of  about 300 to about 5,000 centipoise (cp). In other embodi  ments, the gel can have a viscosity of from about 5 to about  300 cps, from about 10 cps to about 50 cps, from about 15 cps  to about 75 cps at room temperature. The gel may optionally  have a viscosity  enhancing agent such as,  for example,  hydroxypropyl  cellulose,  hydroxypropyl  methylcellulose,  hydroxyethyl methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose and  salts  thereof,  Carbopol, poly-(hydroxyethylmethacrylate),  poly-(methoxyethylmethacrylate), poly(methoxyethoxyeth  ylmethacrylate), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), methyl  methacrylate (MMA), gelatin, polyvinyl alcohols, propylene  glycol, PEG 200, PEG 300, PEG 400, PEG 500, PEG 600,  PEG 700, PEG 800, PEG 900, PEG 1000, PEG 1450, PEG  3350, PEG 4500, PEG 8000 or combinations thereof.   \fUS 8,968,767 B2   23  In various embodiments, when a polymer is employed in  the gel, the polymeric composition includes about 10 wt % to  about 90 wt % or about 30 wt % to about 60 wt % of the  polymer.   In various embodiments, the gel is a hydrogel made of high  molecular weight biocompatible elastomeric polymers of  synthetic or natural origin. A desirable property for the hydro  gel to have is the ability to respond rapidly to mechanical  stresses, particularly shears and loads, in the human body.   Hydrogels obtained from natural Sources are particularly  appealing because they are more likely to be biodegradable  and biocompatible for in vivo applications. Suitable hydro  gels include natural hydrogels, such as, for example, gelatin,  collagen,  silk,  elastin,  fibrin  and polysaccharide-derived  polymers like agarose, and chitosan, glucomannangel, hyalu  ronic acid, polysaccharides, such as cross-linked carboxyl  containing polysaccharides, or a combination thereof. Syn  thetic hydrogels include, but are not limited to those formed  from polyvinyl alcohol, acrylamides Such as polyacrylic acid  and poly(acrylonitrile-acrylic acid), polyurethanes, polyeth  ylene glycol (e.g., PEG 3350, PEG 4500, PEG 8000), sili  cone, polyolefins such as polyisobutylene and polyisoprene,  copolymers of silicone and polyurethane, neoprene, nitrile,  Vulcanized  rubber,  poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone),  acrylates  Such as poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) and copolymers  of acrylates with N-vinyl pyrolidone, N-vinyl lactams, poly  acrylonitrile or combinations thereof. The hydrogel materials  may further be cross-linked to provide further strength as  needed. Examples of different types of polyurethanes include  thermoplastic or thermoset polyurethanes, aliphatic or aro  matic polyurethanes, polyetherurethane, polycarbonate-ure  thane  or  silicone  polyether-urethane,  or  a combination  thereof.   In various embodiments, rather than directly admixing the  therapeutic agents into the gel, microspheres may be dis  persed within the gel, the microspheres being loaded with at  least one analgesic agent and at least one anti-inflammatory  agent. In one embodiment, the microspheres provide for a  Sustained release of the at least one analgesic agent and at  least one anti-inflammatory agent. In yet another embodi  ment, the gel, which is biodegradable, prevents the micro  spheres from releasing the at least one analgesic agent and at  least one anti-inflammatory agent; the microspheres thus do  not release the at least one analgesic agent and at least one  anti-inflammatory agent until they have been released from  the gel. For example, a gel may be deployed around a target  tissue site (e.g., a nerve root). Dispersed within the gel are a  plurality of microspheres that encapsulate the desired thera  peutic agent. Certain of these microspheres degrade once  released from the gel, thus releasing the at least one analgesic  agent and at least one anti-inflammatory agent. The analgesic  agents and anti-inflammatory agents may be placed into sepa  rate microspheres and then the microspheres combined, or the  active ingredients can first be combined and then placed into  the microspheres together.   Microspheres, much like a fluid, may disperse relatively  quickly, depending upon the Surrounding tissue type, and  hence disperse the at least one analgesic agent and at least one  anti-inflammatory agent. In some embodiments, the diameter  of the microspheres range from about 10 microns in diameter  to about 200 microns in diameter. In some embodiments they  range from about 20 to 120 microns in diameters. Methods for  making microspheres include but are not limited to Solvent  evaporation, phase separation and fluidized bed coating. In  Some situations, this may be desirable; in others, it may be   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   24  more desirable to keep the at least one analgesic agent and at  least one anti-inflammatory agent tightly constrained to a  well-defined target site.   The present invention also contemplates the use of adher  ent gels to so constrain dispersal of the therapeutic agent.  These gels may be deployed, for example, in a disc space, in  a spinal canal, or in Surrounding tissue.  Cannulas and Needles   It will be appreciated by those with skill in the art that the  depot can be administered to the target site using a \"cannula\u201d  or \u201cneedle' that can be a part of a drug delivery device e.g., a  Syringe, a gun drug delivery device, or any medical device  Suitable for the application of a drug to a targeted organ or  anatomic region. The cannula or needle of the drug depot  device is designed to cause minimal physical and psychologi  cal trauma to the patient.   Cannulas or needles include tubes that may be made from  materials.  Such as for example, polyurethane, poly-urea,  polyether(amide),  PEBA,  thermoplastic  stomeric  olefin,  copolyester, and styrenic thermoplastic elastomer, steel, alu  minum, stainless steel, titanium, metal alloys with high non  ferrous metal content and a low relative proportion of iron,  carbon fiber, glass fiber, plastics, ceramics or combinations  thereof. The cannula or needle may optionally include one or  more tapered regions. In various embodiments, the cannula or  needle may be beveled. The cannula or needle may also have  a tip style vital for accurate treatment of the patient depending  on the site for implantation. Examples of tip styles include,  for example, Trephine, Cournand, Veress, Huber, Seldinger,  Chiba, Francine, Bias, Crawford, deflected tips,  Hustead,  Lancet, or Tuohey. In various embodiments, the cannula or  needle may also be non-coring and have a sheath covering it  to avoid unwanted needle Sticks.   The dimensions of the hollow cannula or needle, among  other things, will depend on the site for implantation. For  example, width of the epidural space is only about 3-5 mm for  the thoracic region and about 5-7 mm for the lumbar region.  Thus, the needle or cannula, in various embodiments, can be  designed for these specific areas. In various embodiments, the  cannula or needle may be inserted using a transforaminal  approach in the spinal foramen space, for example, along an  inflammed nerve root and the drug depot implanted at this site  for treating  the  condition.  Typically,  the  transforaminal  approach  involves  approaching  the  intervertebral  space  through the intervertebral foramina.   Some examples of lengths of the cannula or needle may  include, but are not limited to, from about 50 to 150 mm in  length, for example, about 65 mm for epidural pediatric use,  about 85 mm for a standard adult and about 110 mm for an  obese adult patient. The thickness of the cannula or needle  will also depend on the site  of implantation.  In various  embodiments, the thickness includes, but is not limited to,  from about 0.05 to about 1.655. The gauge of the cannula or  needle may be the widest or smallest diameter or a diameter in  between for insertion into a human or animal body. The  widest diameter is typically about 14 gauge, while the Small  est diameter is about 25 gauge. In various embodiments the  gauge of the needle or cannula is about 18 to about 22 gauge.  In various embodiments, like the drug depot and/or gel, the  cannula or needle includes dose radiographic markers that  indicate locationator near the site beneath the skin, so that the  user may accurately position the depotator near the site using  any of the numerous diagnostic imaging procedures. Such  diagnostic imaging procedures include, for example, X-ray  imaging or fluoroscopy.  Examples of Such radiographic  markers include, but are not limited to, barium, calcium phos  phate, and/or metal beads or particles.   \fUS 8,968,767 B2   25  In  various  embodiments, the  needle or cannula  may  include a transparent or translucent portion that can be visu  alizable by ultrasound, fluoroscopy, X-ray, or other imaging  techniques. In Such embodiments, the transparent or translu  cent portion may include a radiopaque material or ultrasound  responsive topography that increases the contrast of the  needle or cannula relative to the absence of the material or  topography.  Sterilization   The drug depot, and/or medical device to administer the  drug may be sterilizable. In various embodiments, one or  more components of the drug depot, and/or medical device to  administer the drug are sterilized by radiation in a terminal  sterilization step in the final packaging. Terminal sterilization  of a product provides greater assurance of sterility than from  processes such as an aseptic process, which require individual  product components to be sterilized separately and the final  package assembled in a sterile environment.   Typically, in various embodiments, gamma radiation is  used in the terminal sterilization step, which involves utiliz  ing ionizing energy from gamma rays that penetrates deeply  in the device. Gamma rays are highly effective in killing  microorganisms, they leave no residues nor have sufficient  energy to impart radioactivity to the device. Gamma rays can  be employed when the device is in the package and gamma  sterilization does not require high pressures or vacuum con  ditions, thus, package seals and other components are not  stressed. In addition, gamma radiation eliminates the need for  permeable packaging materials.   In various embodiments, electronbeam (e-beam) radiation  may be used to sterilize one or more components of the  device.  E-beam radiation  comprises a form of ionizing  energy, which is generally characterized by low penetration  and high-dose rates. E-beam irradiation is similar to gamma  processing in that it alters various chemical and molecular  bonds on contact, including the reproductive cells of micro  organisms. Beams produced for e-beam sterilization are con  centrated, highly-charged streams of electrons generated by  the acceleration and conversion of electricity. E-beam steril  ization may be used, for example, when the drug depot is  included in a gel.   Other methods may also be used to sterilize the depot  and/or one or more components of the device, including, but  not limited to, gas sterilization, such as, for example, with  ethylene oxide or steam sterilization.  Kits   In various embodiments, a kit is provided comprising a  plurality of implantable drug depots useful for reducing, pre  venting or treating pain and inflammation in a patient in need  of such treatment, the kit comprising a first set of the plurality  of drug depots capable of releasing atherapeutically effective  bolus dose of an analgesic and/or an anti-inflammatory agent  or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof at a site beneath  the skin and a second set of the plurality of drug depots  capable of releasing a therapeutically effective amount of the  analgesic and the anti-inflammatory agent or pharmaceuti  cally acceptable salts thereof over a period of at least three  days.   The kit may include additional parts along with the drug  depot and/or medical device combined together to be used to  implant the drug depots (e.g., pellets, gel, etc.). The kit may  include the drug depot device in a first compartment. The  second compartment may include a canister holding the drug  depots or each drug depot with a different release profile may  be labeled and placed in a different compartment (e.g., bolus  dose depot compartment, Sustained release depot compart  ment, etc.) and any other instruments needed for the localized   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   26  drug delivery. A third compartment may include gloves,  drapes, wound dressings and other procedural Supplies for  maintaining sterility of the implanting process, as well as an  instruction booklet. A fourth compartment may include addi  tional cannulas and/or needles. Each tool may be separately  packaged in a plastic pouch that is radiation sterilized. A fifth  compartment may include an agent for radiographic imaging.  A cover of the kit may include illustrations of the implanting  procedure and a clear plastic cover may be placed over the  compartments to maintain sterility.  Administration   In various embodiments, the analgesic agent and the anti  inflammatory agent may be parenterally administered. The  term \u201cparenteral  as used herein refers to modes of adminis  tration, which bypass the gastrointestinal tract, and include  for example, intravenous, intramuscular, continuous or inter  mittent infusion, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, Subcutaneous,  intra-operatively,  intrathecally,  intradiskally,  peridiskally,  epidurally, perispinally, intraarticular injection or combina  tions thereof.   Parenteral administration may additionally include, for  example, an infusion pump that administers a pharmaceutical  composition (e.g., analgesic and anti-inflammatory combina  tion) through a catheter near the spine or one or more inflamed  joints, an implantable mini-pump that can be inserted at or  near the target site, an implantable controlled release device  or Sustained release delivery system that can release a certain  amount of the composition per hour or in intermittent bolus  doses. One example of a suitable pump for use is the Syn  chroMed R  (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn.) pump. This  pump has three sealed chambers. One contains an electronic  module and battery. The second contains a peristaltic pump  and drug reservoir. The third contains an inert gas, which  provides the pressure needed to force the pharmaceutical  composition into the peristaltic pump. To fill the pump, the  pharmaceutical composition is injected through the reservoir  fill port to the expandable reservoir. The inert gas creates  pressure on the reservoir, and the pressure forces the pharma  ceutical composition through a filterand into the pump cham  ber. The pharmaceutical composition is then pumped out of  the device from the pump chamber and into the catheter,  which will direct it for deposit at the target site. The rate of  delivery of pharmaceutical composition is controlled by a  microprocessor. This allows the pump to be used to deliver  similar or different amounts of pharmaceutical composition  continuously, at specific times, or at set intervals between  deliveries.   Potential drug delivery devices suitable for adaptation for  the methods described herein include but are not limited to  those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,551,290  (assigned to Medtronic, the entire disclosure is herein incor  porated by reference), which describes a medical catheter for  target specific drug delivery; U.S. Pat. No. 6,571,125 (as  signed to Medtronic, the entire disclosure is herein incorpo  rated by reference), which describes an implantable medical  device for controllably releasing a biologically active agent;  U.S. Pat. No. 6,591,880 (assigned to Medtronic, the entire  disclosure  is  herein  incorporated  by  reference),  which  describes an intraparenchymal infusion catheter system for  delivering therapeutic agents to selected sites in an organism;  and U.S. Pat. No. 5,752.930 (assigned to Medtronic, the  entire disclosure is herein incorporated by reference), which  describes an implantable catheter for infusing equal Volumes  of agents to spaced sites. In various embodiments, pumps  may be adapted with a pre-programmable implantable appa  ratus with a feedback regulated delivery, a micro-reservoir  osmotic release system for controlled release of chemicals,   \fUS 8,968,767 B2   27  Small, light-weight devices for delivering liquid medication,  implantable microminiature infusion devices, implantable  ceramic valve pump assemblies, or implantable infusion  pumps with a collapsible fluid chamber. Alzet(R) osmotic  pumps (Durect Corporation, Cupertino, Calif.) are also avail  able in a variety of sizes, pumping rates, and durations Suit  able for use in the described methods. In various embodi  ments, a method for delivering a therapeutic agent at or near  the target tissue site of a patient is provided. The method  comprising inserting a cannula at or near a target tissue site  and implanting the drug depot at the target site beneath the  skin of the patient and brushing, dripping, injecting, or paint  ing the gel in the target site to hold or have the drug depot  adhere to the target site. In this way unwanted migration of the  drug depot away from the target site is reduced or eliminated.  In various embodiments, because the combination of anal  gesic and anti-inflammatory agent is locally administered,  therapeutically effective doses may be less than doses admin  istered by other routes (oral, topical, etc.). In turn, systemic  side effects, such as for example, liver transaminase eleva  tions, hepatitis, liver failure, myopathy, constipation, etc. may  be reduced or eliminated.   In various embodiments, to administer the gel having the  drug depot dispersed therein to the desired site, first the can  nula or needle can be inserted through the skin and Soft tissue  down to the target tissue site and the gel administered (e.g.,  brushed, dripped, injected, or painted, etc.) at or near the  target site.  In those embodiments where the drug depot is  separate from the gel, first the cannula or needle can be  inserted through the skin and soft tissue down to the site of  injection and one or more base layer(s) of gel can be admin  istered to the target site. Following administration of the one  or more base layer(s), the drug depot can be implanted on or  in the base layer(s) so that the gel can hold the depot in place  or reduce migration. If required a Subsequent layer or layers  of gel can be applied on the drug depot to Surround the depot  and further hold it in place. Alternatively, the drug depot may  be implanted first and then the gel placed (e.g., brushed,  dripped, injected, or painted, etc.) around the drug depot to  hold it in place. By using the gel, accurate and precise implan  tation of a drug depot can be accomplished with minimal  physical and psychological trauma to the patient. The gel also  avoids the need to Suture the drug depot to the target site  reducing physical and psychological trauma to the patient.   In various embodiments, when the target site comprises a  spinal region, a portion of fluid (e.g., spinal fluid, etc.) can be  withdrawn from the target site through the cannula or needle  first and then the depot administered (e.g., placed, dripped,  injected, or implanted, etc.). The target site will re-hydrate  (e.g., replenishment of fluid) and this aqueous environment  will cause the drug to be released from the depot.   FIG. 4 illustrates a number of common locations within a  patient that may be sites at which inflammation and/or pain  may occur. It will be recognized that the locations illustrated  in FIG. 4 are merely exemplary of the many different loca  tions within a patient that may be the sites of inflammation  and/or pain.  For example, inflammation and/or pain may  occur at a patient\u2019s knees 21, hips 22, fingers 23, thumbs 24.  neck 25, and spine 26.   One exemplary embodiment where the depot is suitable for  use in pain management due to inflammation is illustrated in  FIG. 5. Schematically shown in FIG. 5 is a dorsal view of the  spine and sites where the drug depot may be inserted using a  cannula or needle beneath the skin 34 to a spinal site 32 (e.g.,  spinal disc space, spinal canal, soft tissue Surrounding the  spine, nerve root, etc.) and one or more drug depots 28 and 32  are delivered to various sites along the spine. In this way,   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   28  when several drug depots are to be implanted, they are  implanted in a manner that optimizes location, accurate spac  ing, and drug distribution.   Although the spinal site is shown, as described above, the  drug depot can be delivered to any site beneath the skin,  including, but not limited to, at least one muscle, ligament,  tendon, cartilage, spinal disc, spinal foraminal space, near the  spinal nerve root, or spinal canal.   The at least one analgesic agent and at least one anti  inflammatory agent-based formulation may be used to form  different  pharmaceutical preparations  (e.g.,  drug depots,  injectable formulations, etc.). The pharmaceutical prepara  tions may be formed in an administration with a suitable  pharmaceutical carrier that may be solid or liquid, and placed  in the appropriate form for parenteral or other administration  as desired. As persons of ordinary skill are aware, known  carriers include but are not limited to water, gelatin, lactose,  starches, Stearic acid, magnesium Stearate, Sicaryl alcohol,  talc, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, gums, waxes, propylene  glycol, polyalkylene glycols and other known carriers.   Another embodiment provides a method for treating a  mammal Suffering  from inflammation  and/or pain,  said  method comprising administering a therapeutically effective  amount of at least one analgesic agent and at least one anti  inflammatory agent at a target site beneath the skin at or near  the target site. The at least one analgesic agent and at least one  anti-inflammatory agent may for example be administered  locally to the target tissue site as a drug depot.   In some embodiments, the therapeutically effective dosage  amount and the release rate profile are sufficient to reduce  inflammation and/or pain for a period of at least one day, for  example, 1-90 days, 1-10 days, 1-3 days, 3-7 days, 3-12 days:  3-14 days, 7-10 days, 7-14 days, 7-21 days, 7-30 days, 7-50  days, 7-90 days, 7-140 days, or 14-140 days.   In some embodiments the at least one analgesic agent and  at least one anti-inflammatory agent or a portion of the at least  one analgesic agent and at least one anti-inflammatory agent  are administered as a bolus dose at the target tissue to provide  an immediate release of the at least one analgesic agent and at  least one anti-inflammatory agent.   In some embodiments there is a composition useful for the  treatment of inflammation comprising an effective amount of  at least one analgesic agent and at least one anti-inflammatory  agent that is capable of being administered to e.g., a pain or  inflammatory site. By way of example, they may be admin  istered locally to the foraminal spine, the epidural space or the  intrathecal space of a spinal cord. Exemplary administration  routes include but are not limited to catheter drug pumps, one  or more local injections, polymer releases or combinations  thereof.   In some embodiments, the at least one analgesic agent and  at  least  one  anti-inflammatory  agent  are  administered  parenterally, e.g., by injection. In some embodiments, the  injection is intrathecal, which refers to an injection into the  spinal canal (intrathecal space Surrounding the spinal cord).  An injection may also be into a muscle or other tissue. In other  embodiments, the analgesic agent and the anti-inflammatory  agent is administered by placement into an open patient cav  ity during Surgery.   In some embodiments, the formulation is implantable at or  near a target tissue site at the time of Surgery. The active  ingredients may then be released from the depot via diffusion  in a Sustained fashion over a period of time, e.g., 3-15 days,  5-10 days or 7-10 days post surgery in order to address pain  and inflammation.   In some embodiments, a desired release profile is main  tained for at least three days, at least ten days, at least twenty   \fUS 8,968,767 B2   29  days, at least thirty days, at least forty days, at least fifty days,  at least ninety days, at least one hundred days, at least one  hundred and thirty-five days, at least one-hundred and fifty  days, or at least one hundred and eighty days.   In some embodiments, the drug depot may release 5%,  10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%,  90%. 95%, or 99% of the at least one analgesic agent or  pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and at least one anti  inflammatory  agent  or  pharmaceutically  acceptable  salt  thereof relative to a total amount of at least one analgesic  agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and at least  one anti-inflammatory agent loaded in the drug depot over a  period of at least three days, at least seven days, at least ten  days, at least twenty days, at least thirty days, at least forty  days, at least fifty days, at least ninety days, at least one  hundred days, at least one-hundred and thirty-five days, at  least one-hundred and fifty days, or at least one hundred and  eighty days. In various embodiments, the analgesic will be  released in an initial burst dose, then the analgesic will be  released daily for 3 days and then stop (e.g., this will be  Suitable to  reduce, prevent or treat, post-operative pain),  while the anti-inflammatory agent will be released daily with  out a burst dose for 3 to 12 days, 5 to 10 days or 7 to 10 days  after the drug depot is administered to the target tissue site.  In various embodiments, an implantable drug depot useful  for reducing, preventing or treating pain and inflammation is  provided in a patient in need of Such treatment, the implant  able  drug  depot  comprising  a  therapeutically  effective  amount of an analgesic and an anti-inflammatory agent or  pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof the depot being  implantable at a site beneath the skin to reduce, prevent or  treat pain and/or inflammation, wherein the drug depot (i)  comprises one or more immediate release layer(s) that is  capable of releasing about 5% to about 20% of the analgesic  and the anti-inflammatory agent or pharmaceutically accept  able salts thereof relative to a total amount of the analgesic  and the anti-inflammatory agent or pharmaceutically accept  able salts thereof loaded in the drug depot over a first period  of up to 48 hours and (ii) one or more Sustain release layer(s)  that is capable of releasing about 21% to about 99% of the  analgesic and the anti-inflammatory agent or pharmaceuti  cally acceptable salts thereof relative to a total amount of the  analgesic and the anti-inflammatory agent or pharmaceuti  cally acceptable salts thereof loaded in the drug depot over a  Subsequent period of up to 3 days to 6 months or 3 days to 2  weeks.   By way of non-limiting example, the target tissue site may  comprise at least one muscle, ligament, tendon, cartilage,  spinal disc, spinal foraminal space near the spinal nerve root,  facet or spinal canal. The target tissue may be associated with  an acute disease or chronic disease or Surgery.   In some embodiments, the at least one analgesic agent or  pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and at least one anti  inflammatory  agent  or  pharmaceutically  acceptable  salt  thereof is encapsulated in a plurality of depots comprising  microparticles, microspheres, microcapsules, and/or microfi  bers Suspended in a gel.   In some embodiments, an implantable drug depot is pro  vided, wherein the drug depot (i) comprises one or more  immediate release layer(s) that releases a bolus dose of at  least one analgesic agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salt  thereof and at least one anti-inflammatory agent or pharma  ceutically acceptable salt thereofat a site beneath the skin and  (ii) one or more Sustain release layer(s) that releases an effec  tive amount of at least one analgesic agent or pharmaceuti  cally acceptable salt thereof and at least one anti-inflamma  tory agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof over a   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   30  period of 3 days to 6 months. By way of example, in the drug  depot, the one or more immediate release layer(s) may com  prise poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and the one or more  Sustain release layer(s) may comprise polylactide  Method of Making   In various embodiments, the drug depot comprising the  active ingredients can be made by combining a biocompatible  polymer and a therapeutically effective amount of the active  ingredients or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and  forming the implantable drug depot from the combination.   Various techniques are available for forming at least a  portion of a drug depot from the biocompatible polymer(s),  therapeutic agent(s), and optional materials, including solu  tion processing techniques and/or thermoplastic processing  techniques. Where solution processing techniques are used, a  Solvent system is typically selected that contains one or more  Solvent species. The solvent system is generally a good sol  vent for at least one component of interest, for example,  biocompatible polymer and/or therapeutic agent. The par  ticular solvent species that make up the solvent system can  also be selected based on other characteristics, including dry  ing rate and Surface tension.  Solution processing techniques include solvent casting  techniques, spin coating techniques, web coating techniques,  Solvent spraying techniques, dipping techniques, techniques  involving coating via mechanical Suspension, including air  Suspension (e.g., fluidized coating), inkjet techniques and  electrostatic techniques. Where appropriate, techniques such  as those listed above can be repeated or combined to build up  the depot to obtain the desired release rate and desired thick  CSS.  In various embodiments, a solution containing solvent and  biocompatible polymer are combined and placed in a mold of  the desired size and shape. In this way, polymeric regions,  including barrier layers, lubricious layers, and so forth can be  formed. If desired, the solution can further comprise, one or  more of the following: other therapeutic agent(s) and other  optional additives such as radiographic agent(s), etc., in dis  solved or dispersed form. This results in a polymeric matrix  region containing these species after solvent removal. In other  embodiments, a Solution containing solvent with dissolved or  dispersed therapeutic agent is applied to a pre-existing poly  meric region, which can be formed using a variety of tech  niques including solution processing and thermoplastic pro  cessing  techniques,  whereupon the  therapeutic  agent  is  imbibed into the polymeric region.   Thermoplastic  processing  techniques  for  forming the  depot or portions thereof include molding techniques (for  example,  injection  molding,  rotational  molding,  and so  forth), extrusion techniques (for example, extrusion, co-ex  trusion, multi-layer extrusion, and so forth) and casting.   Thermoplastic  processing  in  accordance  with  various  embodiments comprises mixing or compounding, in one or  more stages, the biocompatible polymer(s) and one or more  of the following: the active ingredients, optional additional  therapeutic agent(s), radiographic agent(s), and so forth. The  resulting mixture is then shaped into an implantable drug  depot. The mixing and shaping operations may be performed  using any of the conventional devices known in the art for  Such purposes.   During thermoplastic processing, there exists the potential  for the therapeutic agent(s) to degrade, for example, due to  elevated temperatures and/or mechanical shear that are asso  ciated with Such processing. For example, certain therapeutic  agents may undergo Substantial degradation under ordinary  thermoplastic processing conditions.  Hence, processing is  preferably performed under modified conditions, which pre   \fUS 8,968,767 B2   31  vent the Substantial degradation of the therapeutic agent(s).  Although it is understood that some degradation may be  unavoidable during thermoplastic processing, degradation is  generally limited to 10% or less. Among the processing con  ditions that may be controlled during processing to avoid  Substantial degradation of the therapeutic agent(s) are tem  perature, applied shear rate, applied shear stress, residence  time of the mixture containing the therapeutic agent, and the  technique by which the polymeric material and the therapeu  tic agent(s) are mixed.   Mixing or compounding biocompatible polymer with  therapeutic agent(s) and any additional additives to form a  Substantially homogenous mixture thereofmay be performed  with any device known in the art and conventionally used for  mixing polymeric materials with additives.   Where thermoplastic materials are employed, a polymer  melt may be formed by heating the biocompatible polymer,  which can be mixed with various additives (e.g., therapeutic  agent(s), inactive ingredients, etc.) to form a mixture. A com  mon way of doing so is to apply mechanical shear to a mixture  of the biocompatible polymer(s) and additive(s). Devices in  which the biocompatible polymer(s) and additive(s) may be  mixed in this fashion include devices such as single screw  extruders, twin screw extruders, banbury mixers, high-speed  mixers, ross kettles, and so forth.   Any of the biocompatible polymer(s) and various additives  may be premixed prior to a final thermoplastic mixing and  shaping process, if desired (e.g., to prevent Substantial deg  radation of the therapeutic agent among other reasons).   For example, in various embodiments, a biocompatible  polymer is precompounded with a radiographic agent (e.g.,  radio-opacifying agent) under conditions of temperature and  mechanical shear that would result in Substantial degradation  of the therapeutic agent, if it were present. This precom  pounded material is then mixed with therapeutic agent under  conditions of lower temperature and mechanical shear, and  the resulting mixture is  shaped into the active ingredient  containing drug depot. Conversely, in another embodiment,  the biocompatible polymer can be precompounded with the  therapeutic agent under conditions of reduced temperature  and mechanical shear. This precompounded material is then  mixed with, for example, a radio-opacifying agent, also under  conditions of reduced temperature and mechanical shear, and  the resulting mixture is shaped into the drug depot.   The conditions used to achieve a mixture of the biocom  patible polymer and therapeutic agent and other additives will  depend on a number of factors including, for example, the  specific biocompatible polymer(s) and additive(s) used, as  well as the type of mixing device used.   As an example, different biocompatible polymers will  typically soften to facilitate mixing at different temperatures.  For instance, where a depot is formed comprising PLGA or  PLA polymer, a radio-opacifying agent (e.g., bismuth Sub  carbonate), and a therapeutic agent prone to degradation by  heat and/or mechanical shear (e.g.,  clonidine), in various  embodiments, the PGLA or PLA can be premixed with the  radio-opacifying agent attemperatures of about, for example,  150\u00b0 C. to 170\u00b0 C. The therapeutic agent is then combined  with the premixed composition and subjected to further ther  moplastic  processing  at  conditions  of temperature  and  mechanical shear that are substantially lower than is typical  for PGLA or PLA compositions. For example, where extrud  ers are used, barrel temperature, Volumetric output are typi  cally controlled to limit the shear and therefore to prevent  Substantial  degradation  of the  therapeutic  agent(s).  For  instance, the therapeutic agent and premixed composition can  be mixed/compounded using a twin screw extruder at Sub   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   32  stantially lower temperatures (e.g., 100-105\u00b0C.), and using  substantially reduced volumetric output less than 30% of full  capacity, which generally corresponds to a Volumetric output  of less than 200 cc/min). It is  noted that this processing  temperature is well below the melting points of certain active  ingredients,  such  as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic  because processing at or above these temperatures will result  in Substantial therapeutic agent degradation. It is  further  noted that in certain embodiments, the processing tempera  ture will be below the melting point of all bioactive com  pounds within the composition, including the therapeutic  agent. After compounding, the resulting depot is shaped into  the desired form, also under conditions of reduced tempera  ture and shear.   In other embodiments, biodegradable polymer(s) and one  or more therapeutic agents are premixed using non-thermo  plastic techniques. For example, the biocompatible polymer  can be dissolved in a solvent system containing one or more  Solvent species. Any desired agents (for example, a radio  opacifying agent, a therapeutic agent, or both radio-opacify  ing agent and therapeutic agent) can also be dissolved or  dispersed in the solvents system. Solvent is then removed  from the resulting Solution/dispersion, forming a solid mate  rial. The resulting Solid material can then be granulated for  further thermoplastic processing (for example, extrusion) if  desired.   As another example, the therapeutic agent can be dissolved  or dispersed in a solvent system, which is then applied to a  pre-existing drug depot (the pre-existing drug depot can be  formed using a variety of techniques including solution and  thermoplastic processing techniques, and it can comprise a  variety of additives including a radio-opacifying agent and/or  Viscosity enhancing agent), whereupon the therapeutic agent  is imbibed on or in the drug depot. As above, the resulting  Solid material can then be granulated for further processing, if  desired.   Typically, an extrusion processes may be used to form the  drug depot comprising a biocompatible polymer(s), thera  peutic agent(s) and radio-opacifying agent(s). Co-extrusion  may also be employed, which is a shaping process that can be  used to produce a drug depot comprising the same or different  layers or regions (for example, a structure comprising one or  more polymeric matrix layers or regions that have permeabil  ity  to  fluids  to  allow  immediate and/or Sustained  drug  release). Multi-region depots can also be formed by other  processing and shaping techniques such as co-injection or  sequential injection molding technology.   In various embodiments, the depot that may emerge from  the thermoplastic processing (e.g., pellet, strip, etc.) is cooled.  Examples of cooling processes include air cooling and/or  immersion in a cooling bath. In some embodiments, a water  bath is used to cool the extruded depot. However, where a  water-soluble therapeutic agent Such as active ingredients are  used, the immersion time should be held to a minimum to  avoid unnecessary loss of therapeutic agent into the bath.   In various embodiments, immediate removal of water or  moisture by use of ambient or warm air jets after exiting the  bath will also prevent re-crystallization of the drug on the  depot Surface, thus controlling or minimizing a high drug  dose \u201cinitial burst' or \u201cbolus dose  upon implantation or  insertion if this is release profile is not desired. Thus, a sus  tained release  region of the drug depot may, in  various  embodiments, be made by immediately removal of water or  moisture.   In various embodiments, the drug depot can be prepared by  mixing or spraying the drug with the polymer and then mold  ing the depot to the desired shape. In various embodiments,   \fUS 8,968,767 B2   33  active ingredients are used and mixed or sprayed with the  PLGA or PEG550 polymer, and the resulting depot may be  formed by extrusion and dried.   The drug depot may also comprise combining a biocom  patible polymer and a therapeutically effective amount of at  least one analgesic agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salt  thereof and at least one anti-inflammatory agent or pharma  ceutically acceptable salt thereofand forming the implantable  drug depot from the combination.   It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various  modifications and variations can be made to various embodi  ments described herein without departing from the spirit or  Scope of the teachings herein.

DRUG DELVERY PLATFORMIUTILIZING  HYDROGEL PUMPING MECHANISM   FIELD OF THE INVENTION   This invention relates generally to microfluidic devices,  and in particular, to a drug delivery platform utilizing a hydro  gel pumping mechanism to provide controlled infusion of a  drug to an individual.   BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE  INVENTION   As is known, the pharmaceutical industry has had limited  Success overcoming the challenges of delivering pharmaceu  ticals to patients. The oral ingestion of pharmaceuticals is  considered the safest, most convenient and most economical  method of drug administration. As compared to present alter  natives, patient acceptance and adherence to a dosing regimen  is typically higher among orally delivered pharmaceuticals.  However, the oral delivery of many pharmaceuticals is not  possible because the pharmaceuticals are either too large or  too electrically charged to pass through the Small intestine to  reach the bloodstream. In addition, many pharmaceuticals  which are unable to withstand the environment of the diges  tive tractor to penetrate the dermis need to be injected into the  patient (e.g. insulin, proteins).   In order to overcome the problems associated with orally  delivered pharmaceuticals, transdermal drug delivery patches  have been developed. Transdermal drug delivery patches  incorporate a medication and are intended to adhere to the  skin of an individual.  Molecules of the medication pass  through the skin and into the bloodstream of the individual  thereby delivering a specific dose of medication. While func  tional for their intended purposes, these patches have certain  inherent limitations. By way of example, since the skin is a  very effect barrier, existing transdermal drug delivery patches  can only be used to deliver Small molecule drugs such as  nicotine and birth control. Alternatively, other transdermal  technologies have been developed that utilize pressurized gas  or Voltage to move larger drug molecules across the skin  barrier into the bloodstream. Again, while functional for their  intended purposes, use of these technologies are limited to  Smaller Volume injections and may have the undesired effect  ofaltering the medications supplied to individuals. Therefore,  a transdermal drug delivery device that provides controlled  infusion of a drug to an individual without the use of pressur  ized gas or Voltage would constitute a significant advance  ment in the art.   Therefore, it is a primary object and feature of the present  invention to provide a drug delivery device that provides  controlled infusion of a drug to an individual without the use  of pressurized gas or Voltage.   It is a further object and feature of the present invention to  provide a drug delivery device that provides controlled infu  sion of a drug to an individual while maximizing the Volume  of drug delivered.   It is a still further object and feature of the present invention  to provide a drug delivery device that provides controlled  infusion of a drug to an individual that is simple to utilize and  inexpensive to manufacture.   In accordance with the present invention, a drug delivery  platform is provided for delivering a controlled infusion of a  drug to an individual. The drug delivery platform includes a  reservoir for receiving the drug therein and a pressure source  engageable with the reservoir. The pressure source is movable  between a first  configuration and a second configuration   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   2  wherein the pressure source exerts a pressure on the reservoir  to urge the drug therefrom. An output conduit is provided for  transmitting the drug into the individual. An actuation mecha  nism is operatively connected to the pressure source and the  output  conduit.  The  actuation  mechanism  is  movable  between a non-actuated position and an actuated position  wherein pressure source moves from the first configuration to  the second configuration and wherein the input of the output  conduit communicates with the drug and the output end of the  output conduit is receivable in the individual.   The pressure source includes a hydrogel that expands in  response to a predetermined stimulus, such as a fluid. The  drug delivery platform further includes an initiation fluid  wherein the actuation mechanism includes an initiation con  duit having an input and output. The input of the initiation  conduit communicates with the initiation fluid and the output  of the initiation conduit communicates with the pressure  Source in response to the actuation mechanism in the actuated  position. A barrier is positioned between the initiation fluid  and the pressure source. The barrier defines a channel net  work communicating with the pressure source and having an  input that communicates with the output of the initiation  conduit in response to the actuation mechanism in the actu  ated position. A fluid diverter may be provided to direct fluid  from the output of the initiation conduit to the channel net  work. The channel network includes a plurality of circular,  concentric channels.   The actuation mechanism includes a biasing structure for  urging the actuation mechanism towards the non-actuated  position. The reservoir has first and second ends and includes  an output adjacent the first end. The pressure source is posi  tioned adjacent to the second end of the reservoir.   In accordance with a further aspect of the present inven  tion, a drug delivery platform is provided for delivering a  controlled infusion of a drug to an individual. The drug deliv  ery platform includes an initiation fluid and a reservoir for  receiving the drug therein. A pressure source is engageable  with the reservoir. The pressure source is movable between a  first configuration and a second configuration wherein the  pressure source exerts a pressure on the reservoir to urge the  drug therefrom. An output conduit has an input and output,  and an initiation conduit has an input and output. An initiation  button is operatively connected to the output and initiation  conduits. The initiation button is  movable between a non  actuated position and an actuated position. With initiation  button in the non-actuated position, the input of the initiation  conduit is isolated from the initiation fluid and the output of  the initiation conduit is isolated from the pressure source. In  addition, the input of the output conduit is isolated from the  drug and the output of the conduit is isolated from the indi  vidual. With the initiation button in the actuated position, the  input of the initiation conduit communicates with the initia  tion fluid and the output of the initiation conduit communi  cates with the pressure source, and the input of the output  conduit communicates with the drug and the output of the  output conduit is receivable in the individual.   A barrier may be positioned between the initiation fluid  and the pressure source. The barrier defines a channel net  work communicating with the pressure source and has an  input that communicates with the output of the initiation  conduit in response to the initiation button in the actuated  position. A fluid diverter directs fluid from the output of the  initiation conduit to the channel network. The channel net  work may include a plurality of circular, concentric channels.  The drug delivery platform includes a biasing structure for  urging the initiation button towards the non-actuated position.  The reservoir has first and second ends and includes an output   \fUS 8,986,250 B2   3  adjacent the first end. The pressure source is positioned adja  cent the second end of the reservoir.   In accordance with a still  further aspect of the present  invention, a drug delivery platform is provided for delivering  a controlled infusion of a drug to an individual. The drug  delivery platform includes a reservoir for receiving the drug  therein. The reservoir has a first end and a second end. An  expansion structure is positioned over the first end of the  reservoir. The expansion structure has a first configuration  and an expanded second configuration wherein the expansion  structure exerts a pressure on the reservoir to urge the drug  therefrom. An output conduit is movable between a retracted  position and an extended position. An actuation mechanism is  operatively connected to the expansion structure and the out  put conduit and is movable between a non-actuated position  and an actuated position. The expansion structure moves from  the first configuration to the second configuration in response  to the actuation mechanism moving to the actuated position.  The output conduit moves from the retracted position to the  extended position to deliver the drug to the individual there  through in response to actuation mechanism moving to the  actuated position.   The expansion structure includes a hydrogel that expands  in response to a predetermined stimulus, Such as an initiation  fluid. The actuation mechanism includes an initiation conduit  having an input and output. The input of the initiation conduit  communicates with the initiation fluid and the output of the  initiation  conduit  communicates  with  the  hydrogel  in  response to the actuation mechanism in the actuated position.  A barrier is positioned between the initiation fluid and the  expansion structure. The barrier defines a channel network  communicating with the expansion structure and having an  input that communicates with the output of the initiation  conduit in response to the actuation mechanism in the actu  ated position. A fluid diverter directs fluid from the output of  the initiation conduit to the channel network. The channel  network includes a plurality of circular, concentric channels  and the actuation mechanism includes a biasing structure for  urging the actuation mechanism towards the non-actuated  position.

In the depicted embodiment, flow diverter 96 is  generally crescent-shaped. However, other shapes are pos  sible without deviating from the scope of the present inven  tion.   Referring specifically to FIGS. 9-10, a plurality of circum  ferentially spaced ledges 100a-100e project from terminal  surface 80 of middle insert 56. Inner edges 102a-102b of  ledges 100a-100e, respectively, are intended to align hydro  gel disc 44 captured between bladder 26 and middle insert 56  of drug delivery platform 10, as hereinafter described.   Referring back to FIGS. 2 and 5-7, upper surface 58 of  body portion 62 of middle insert 56 includes a generally  circular recess 106 adapted for receiving bladder 108 therein.  Shoulder 110 extends about the outer periphery of recess 106  and is adapted for receiving peripheral edge 112 of bladder  108 thereon. Recess 106 communicates with concave-shaped  recess 94, which in turn, is adapted for receiving output end  114 of bladder 108.   Cover 116 is receiveable on upper surface 58 of middle  insert 56. Cover 116 includes an upper surface 132 and a  lower surface 120. Cover 116 is further defined by a generally  circular body portion 121 and an ear portion 123 projecting  radially from the outer periphery of body portion 121. Lower  surface 120 of body portion 121 has a recess 122 therein  adapted for receiving bladder 108. Shoulder 124 extends  about the outer periphery of recess 122 and is adapted for  engaging peripheral edge 112 of bladder 108. In addition,  lower surface 120 of ear portion 123 of cover 116 includes a  concave-shaped recess 128 for accommodating output end  114 of bladder 108. Needle passageway 130 extends between   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   6  concave-shaped recess 128 in lower surface 120 of cover 116  and upper surface 132 of cover 116, for reasons hereinafter  described.   Ear portion 123 of cover 116 further includes guide pas  sageways 133 and 135 extending therethrough for accommo  dating corresponding guide pins 21 and 23, respectively, for  reasons hereinafter described. Needle passageway 138 and  spring passageway 140 also extend through earportion 123 of  cover 116 between upper and lower surfaces 132 and 120,  respectively. Needle passageway 138 is axially aligned with  concave-shaped recess 94 in upper surface 58 of middle insert  56, while spring passageway 140 is  axially aligned with  spring passageway 66 through ear portion 64 of middle insert  56 and with circular recess 38 extending into upper surface 16  of ear portion 15 of base 12. Spring passageway 140 has a  diameter Sufficient to accommodate spring 42, for reasons  hereinafter described.   In order to actuate drug delivery platform 10, initiation  button 142 is provided. Initiation button 142 includes agen  erally flat base 144 having an upper surface 146 and a lower  surface 148. Guide wall 150 depends from the outer periphery  of base 142 and extends about the outer periphery of ear  portion 123 of cover 116. Guide wall 150 includes recess 152  therein so as to allow base portion 144 of initiation button 142  to partially overlap upper surface 132 of cover 116. Guide  pins 21 and 23 depend from lower surface 148 and are slid  ably received in corresponding guide passageways 133 and  135, respectively, to guide movement of initiation button 142  between a non-actuated position, FIGS. 3 and 5, and an actu  ated position, FIGS. 4 and 6-7. It is noted that initiation button  142 may include third guide pin 137, FIGS. 3-4, for further  guiding movement of initiation button 142 between the non  actuated and actuated positions. Cover 116 further includes  first and second, generally tubular, needle supports 156 and  158, respectively, depending from lower surface 148 of base  144. First needle support 156 is adapted for receiving upper  end 160 of initiation needle 162. First needle support 156 is  axially aligned with and has a diameter less than needle  passageway 130 through cover 116. As best seen in FIGS.  5-7, initiation needle 162 includes an output 163 at lower end  166 thereof and an input 164 centrally located between upper  end 160 and lower end 166 thereof.   Second needle support 158 is adapted for receiving upper  end 168 of output needle 170. Referring to FIGS. 3-4, output  needle 170 includes an output 172 at lower end 174 thereof  and an input 176 at a location between upper end 168 and  lower end 174 thereof. Output needle 170 extends through  needle passageway 138 in cover 116; needle passageway 67  through middle insert 56; output end 36 of bladder 26; and  needle passageway 25 through base 12. It can be appreciated  that the outer surface of output needle 170 and output end 36  of bladder 26 form a fluid-tight relationship for maintaining a  drug in bladder 26 when drug delivery device is not actuated,  as hereinafter described.   Initiation button 142 further includes a generally tubular  spring retainer 178 depending from lower surface 148 of base  144 and adapted for receiving upper end 180 of spring 42  therein. Spring 42 passes through spring passageway 140 in  cover 116; spring passageway 66 in middle insert 56; and into  recess 38 in base 12 about support post 39. As described, it  can appreciated that initiation button 142 is movable between  the first non-actuated position, FIGS. 3 and 5, and the second  actuated position, FIGS. 4 and 6-7, against the bias of spring  42.   In operation, the drug delivery platform 10 is assembled as  heretofore described whereinbladder 108 is filled with a fluid  to which hydrogel disc 44 is responsive and bladder 26 is   \fUS 8,986,250 B2   10   7  filled with a predetermined drug. Lower surface 22 of adhe  sive pad 18 is affixed to an individual at a desired location so  as to interconnect drug delivery platform 10 to the individual.  Referring to FIGS. 3 and 5, with initiation button 142 in its  non-actuated state, input 164 of initiation needle 162 is iso-  5  lated from output end 114 of bladder 108 and such that output  163 of initiation needle 162 is isolated from input 192 to  recess surface 84 of terminal surface 80 of middle insert56. In  addition, with initiation button 142 in the non-actuated posi  tion, input 176 of output needle 170 is isolated from output  end 36 of bladder 26 and output 172 of output needle 170 is  isolated from the individual to which the drug in bladder 26 is  to be administered.   Referring back to FIGS. 4 and 6, in order to actuate a drug  delivery platform 10, initiation button 142 is pressed against  15  the bias of spring 42 such that initiation needle 162 pierces  output end 114 of bladder 108. As a result, input 164 of  initiation needle 162 communicates with the interior of blad  der 108 via output end 114 and output 163 of initiation needle  162 communicates with input channel 92 of recessed portion  84 of terminal surface 80 in middle insert56. In addition, with  initiation button 142 in the actuated position, input 176 of  output needle 170 communicates with the interior of bladder  26 through output end 36 and output 172 of output needle 170  is received within the individual to which the drug is to be  administered.   25   40   30   35   Referring to FIG. 7, with initiation button 142 in the actu  ated position, fluid flows from the interior of bladder 108 into  initiation needle 162 through input 164 thereof. The fluid  exits initiation needle 162 through output 163 and flows onto  recessed portion 84 of terminal surface 80 through input  channel 92. Flow diverter 96 causes the fluid to flow about the  entirety of recessed portion 84 of terminal surface 80 into  spokes 86a-86b, thereby directing the fluid into flow channels  82a and 82b. Thereafter, the fluid is distributed onto a sub  stantial portion of upper Surface 46 of hydrogel disc 44 and  about the outer periphery thereof. In response, hydrogel disc  44 expands thereby providing pressure onto bladder 26. Flow  diverter 96 acts to prevent hydrogel disc 44 from expanding in  Such a manner as to block input channel 92 and prevent  additional fluid from flowing onto recessed portion 84 of  terminal surface 80 therethrough. As heretofore described,  hydrogel disc 44 is positioned adjacent end 52 of bladder 26  Such that expansion of hydrogel disc 44 urges the drug within  bladder 56 toward output end 36 thereof. Under pressure, the 45  drug flows from the output end 36 of bladder 26 into output  needle 70 through input 176thereof. Thereafter, the drug exits  output needle 170 through output 172 and is dispensed into  the individual.   It can be appreciated that since the rate of expansion of 50   hydrogel disc 44 controls the flow rate of the drug from  bladder 26 into the individual, the desired delivery profiles  Such as bolus injections, constant infusion, delayed onset or  the like are possible simply by altering the chemistry of  hydrogel disc 44. It can also be appreciated the output 172 of 55  output needle 170 can be replaced with a microneedle array or  like without deviating from the scope of the present invention.  Various modes of carrying out the invention are contem  plated as being within the scope of the following claims  particularly pointing and distinctly claiming the Subject mat-  60  ter that is regarded as the invention.   We claim:  1. A drug delivery platform for delivering a controlled   infusion of a drug to an individual, comprising:   8   a reservoir for receiving the drug therein;  a pressure source engageable with the reservoir, the pres  Sure  source  expandable  from  a  first  configuration  wherein the pressure source exerts a first pressure on the  reservoir to a second configuration wherein the pressure  Source exerts a second pressure on the reservoir greater  than the first pressure so as to urge the drug from the  reservoir;   an output conduit having an input and output and being  movable with respect to the reservoir, the output conduit  movable between a retracted position wherein the input  of the output conduit is isolated from the drug in the  reservoir and an extended position wherein the input of  the output conduit communicates with the drug and the  output of the output conduit is receivable in the indi  vidual;   an actuation mechanism operatively connected to the pres  Sure source and to the output conduit, the actuation  mechanism movable between a non-actuated position  and an actuated position;   wherein:   the pressure source expands from the first configuration to  the second configuration in response to movement of the  actuation mechanism to the actuated position;   the pressure on the reservoir generated by the pressure  Source is independent of the movement of the actuation  mechanism; and   the actuation mechanism urges the output conduit to the  extended position as the actuation mechanism moves  toward the actuated position.   2. The drug delivery platform of claim 1 wherein the pres  sure source includes a hydrogel that expands in response to a  predetermined stimulus.   3. The drug delivery platform of claim 2 wherein the pre   determined stimulus is a fluid.   4. The drug delivery platform of claim3 further comprising  an initiation fluid wherein the actuation mechanism includes  an initiation conduit having an input and output, the input of  the initiation conduit communicating with the initiation fluid  and the output of the initiation conduit communicating with  the pressure source in response to the actuation mechanism in  the actuated position.   5. The drug delivery platform of claim 4 further comprising  a barrier between the initiation fluid and the pressure source,  the barrier defining a channel network communicating with  the pressure source and having an input that communicates  with the output of the initiation conduit in response to the  actuation mechanism in the actuated position.   6. The drug delivery platform of claim 5 further comprising  a fluid diverter, the fluid diverter directing fluid from the  output of the initiation conduit to the channel network.   7. The drug delivery platform of claim 5 wherein the chan  nel network includes a plurality of circular, concentric chan  nels.   8. The drug delivery platform of claim 1 wherein the actua  tion mechanism includes a biasing structure for urging the  actuation mechanism towards the non-actuated position.   9. The drug delivery platform of claim 1 wherein the res  ervoir has first and second ends and includes an output adja  cent the first end.   10. The drug delivery platform of claim 9 wherein the  pressure source is positioned adjacent the second end of the  reservoir.", "(12) United States Patent   Shih et al.

In particular, embodiments of the invention  relate  to  drug-delivery  pumps whose actuation  may be  dynamically and adaptively controlled.   25   BACKGROUND   Medical treatment often requires the administration of a  therapeutic agent (e.g., medicament, drugs, etc.) to a particu  lar part of a patient's body. As patients live longer and are  diagnosed with chronic and/or debilitating ailments,  the  likely result will be an increased need to place even more  protein therapeutics, Small-molecule drugs, and other medi  cations into targeted areas throughout the patient\u2019s body.  Some maladies, however, are difficult to treat with currently  available therapies and/or require administration of drugs to  anatomical regions to which access is difficult to achieve.   A patient\u2019s eye is a prime example of a difficult-to-reach  anatomical region, and many vision-threatening diseases,  including retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degen  eration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, are dif  ficult to treat with many of the currently available therapies.  For example, oral medications can have systemic side effects;  topical applications may sting and engender poor patient  compliance; injections generally require a medical visit, can  be painful, and risk infection; and Sustained-release implants  must typically be removed after their Supply is exhausted (and  generally offer limited ability to change the dose in response  to the clinical picture).   Another example is cancer, such as breast cancer or men  ingiomas, where large doses of highly toxic chemotherapies,  Such as rapamycin, bevacizumab (e.g., AVASTIN), or irino  tecan (CPT-11), are typically administered to the patient  intravenously, which may result in numerous undesired side  effects outside the targeted area. Yet another example is drug  delivery to the knee, where drugs often have difficulty pen  etrating the avascular cartilage tissue for diseases such as  osteoarthritis.   Implantable  drug-delivery  devices  (e.g.,  drug-delivery  pumps), which may have a refillable drug reservoir, a cannula  for delivering the drug, a check valve, etc., generally allow for  controlled delivery of pharmaceutical solutions to a specified  target. As drug within the drug reservoir depletes, the physi  cian can refill the reservoir with, for example, a Syringe, while   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   2  leaving the device implanted within the patient\u2019s body. This  approach can minimize the Surgical  incision  needed for  implantation and typically avoids future or repeated invasive  Surgery or procedures.   Implantable drug-delivery pumps, particularly in ocular  applications, often utilize a passive mechanism for drug  delivery (e.g., pumping the drug out when a finger is pressed  on the drug reservoir). One limitation of these conventional,  passively-driven drug-delivery pumps is  their inability to  dynamically respond to changes inside the pump (e.g., fail  ures, blockages, etc.) or to changes in the drug-delivery target  area (e.g., increased pressure, bending of the pump's cannula,  inflammation causing pressure around the cannula, etc.). The  ability to respond to Such changes can improve not only the  therapeutic value of a pump, but also safety.   Active drug-delivery pumps, particularly feedback-driven  ones, represent a Substantial improvement over passively  driven pumps. Typically, these feedback-driven pumps are  electrically-driven  mechanical  pumps.  They  generally  employ controller units that receive inputs from sensors that  monitor the target treatment area and, in response, direct the  release of a pharmaceutical or therapeutic agent to achieve a  desired result. The amount of drug released in each dosage  period is thus largely determined by the current conditions of  the target area and is intended to be variable depending on  what the conditions of the target area warrant.   Pharmaceutical treatment regimens may, however, require  that a drug be administered in fixed amounts at regular time  intervals regardless of the changing conditions in the drug  delivery target area. Since the dosage levels produced by  existing closed-loop feedback-driven systems can be highly  dependent on the parameters of the treatment area and thus  prone to fluctuations, they are inadequate for delivering fixed  drug dosages at periodic intervals. For example, changes in  the conditions of the target area, such as blockages or other  biochemical or physiological events, may lead to variable  levels of drug being delivered to the target area. Accordingly,  there is a need for a feedback-driven pump that maintains the  target dosage level despite such changes.   Furthermore, while feedback based on the conditions of the  target area is important in numerous therapeutic applications,  errors in drug administration can also arise from changing  conditions within the pump itself. Conventional pumps gen  erally do not account for Such changes, which can also lead to  variable amounts of drug being released. Accordingly, there is  also a need for a drug-delivery  pump that  dynamically  responds to changing conditions within the pump itself in  order to, for example, consistently release a fixed dosage of  drug at periodic time intervals.   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   In various embodiments, the present invention features an  external or implantable drug-delivery pump that includes a  dynamic, adaptive control system. The control system may  operate the pump so as to release Substantially fixed amounts  of pharmaceutical or therapeutic agents to a target treatment  area at regular intervals. In certain embodiments, the control  system continuously monitors (either directly or indirectly)  conditions internal to the pump that have an effect on the  degree and duration of pump actuation and, consequently, the  amount of drug that is released. As used herein, the term  \u201csubstantially\u2019 meansit 10% (e.g., by weight or by volume),  and in some embodiments, t5%.   In one embodiment, the drug-delivery pump is an electro  chemically-actuated pump. Such as an electrolysis-driven  pump. Electrochemically-actuated pumps, as compared to   \fUS 9,283,322 B2   3  electrically-driven mechanical pumps, offer several advan  tages for drug-delivery systems. For example, they generally  have few moving parts, which enables them to be small and  portable, and which makes them less prone to mechanical  breakdown than electrically-driven  mechanical pumps. In  particular, electrochemically-actuated pumps are Suitable for  environments that require Small pump sizes, such as the ocu  lar environment. As further described herein, an electrolysis  driven pump generally employs electrodes to generate an  electrochemically active gas that variably pressurizes a drug  contained in a separate chamber in order to dispense the drug  in  a controlled  fashion.  The amount of drug dispensed  depends on the gas pressure variably generated by the pump  actuator, which in turn depends on the current that passes  through the electrodes. Because of the inherent variability in  these electrolysis-driven pumps (e.g., the Volume of gas and/  or the amount of electrolyte can change between every pump  cycle), the adaptive control design described herein can con  fer Substantial advantages, as further explained below.   In general, in one aspect, embodiments of the invention  feature a drug-delivery pump that includes a drug reservoir, a  cannula for conducting liquid from the reservoir to a target  site, a pump actuator for forcing the liquid from the reservoir  through the cannula, and circuitry for controlling the actuator  based on a change in a condition of the pump.   In general, in another aspect, embodiments of the invention  feature a method of delivering a drug to a patient using Such  a drug-delivery pump. The method involves establishing fluid  communication between the drug reservoir and the patient  (i.e., the target site) and controlling the pump actuator based  on a change in a condition of the pump so as to deliver a  dosage of liquid from the drug reservoir into the patient.   In various embodiments, the control circuitry maintains  delivery of a substantially fixed dosage of the liquid at peri  odic time intervals to the target site. Moreover, the circuitry  may include memory for storing the conditions of the pump at  the time of previous delivery events (e.g., at the time of each  delivery interval).  In  one embodiment, the drug-delivery  pump includes a flow sensor for measuring a flow rate of the  liquid through the cannula and into the patient, and the cir  cuitry controls the pump actuator based, at least in part, on an  analysis of the flow rate. The circuitry may also control the  actuator based on the stored conditions of the pump from the  previous doses and/or on real-time data from the actuator. In  another embodiment, the control circuitry maintains delivery  of a Substantially fixed dosage of the liquid over time through  continuous infusion to the target site.   As mentioned, the drug-delivery pump may be an elec  trolysis-driven pump. More particularly, the pump actuator  may include an electrolyte chamber, an expandable dia  phragm that separates the electrolyte chamber from the drug  reservoir and provides a fluid barrier therebetween, and elec  trolysis electrodes that cause evolution of a gas in the elec  trolyte chamber. The evolution of the gas expands the dia  phragm so that the liquid is forced from the drug reservoir into  the cannula. In various embodiments, the diaphragm expan  sion is adjusted by varying the actuation current Supplied to  the electrodes. In other embodiments, the diaphragm expan  sion is adjusted by varying an actuation duration of the elec  trodes. As described herein, the electrolysis electrodes may  be driven with either a constant current or a time-varying  current waveform.   In general, in yet another aspect, embodiments of the  invention feature a drug-delivery pump that includes a drug  reservoir, an electrolyte chamber, electrolysis electrodes, an  expandable diaphragm that separates the electrolyte chamber  from the drug reservoir and provides a fluid barrier therebe   4  tween, a cannula for conducting liquid from the drug reser  Voir to a target site, and circuitry for adjusting expansion of  the diaphragm based on conditions of the target site (e.g.,  changes in one or more biochemical parameters of the target  site, in electrical activity at the target site, and/or in pressure  at the target site). The pump may include a sensor for detect  ing such conditions. For their part, the electrolysis electrodes  may be activated to cause evolution of a gas in the electrolyte  chamber, which expands the diaphragm So that the liquid is  forced from the drug reservoir into the cannula.   In general, in still  another aspect, embodiments of the  invention feature a drug-delivery pump that includes a drug  reservoir, a cannula for conducting liquid from the reservoir  to a target site, a pump actuator for forcing the liquid from the  reservoir through the cannula, and circuitry for controlling  the actuator. In particular, the circuitry controls the actuatori)  to initially deliver a substantially fixed dosage of the liquid at  periodic time intervals to the target site, and ii) to compensate  for a change in a condition of the pump so as to maintain or  resume the delivery of the substantially fixed dosage of the  liquid at the periodic time intervals to the target site.   In general, in a further aspect, embodiments of the inven  tion feature a method of delivering a drug to a patient from a  drug-delivery pump that includes a drug reservoir and a pump  actuator for forcing liquid from the reservoir into the patient.  The  method  involves  establishing  fluid  communication  between the drug reservoir and the patient, and controlling the  pump actuator. In particular, the actuator is controlled i) to  initially deliver a substantially fixed dosage of the liquid at  periodic time intervals  from the drug reservoir  into  the  patient, and ii) to compensate for a change in a condition of  the pump so as to maintain or resume the delivery of the  Substantially fixed dosage of the liquid at the periodic time  intervals into the patient.   These and other objects, along with advantages and fea  tures of the embodiments of the present invention herein  disclosed, will become more apparent through reference to  the following description, the accompanying drawings, and  the claims. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the fea  tures of the various embodiments described herein are not  mutually exclusive and can existin various combinations and  permutations, even if not made explicit herein.   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS   In the drawings, like reference characters generally refer to  the same parts throughout the different views. Also, the draw  ings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead generally  being placed upon illustrating the principles of the invention.  In the following description, various embodiments of the  present invention are described with reference to the follow  ing drawings, in which:   FIG.  1  schematically  illustrates,  in  cross-section,  an  implantable drug-delivery pump in  accordance with one  embodiment of the invention;   FIG.  2  schematically  illustrates,  in  cross-section,  an  implantable drug-delivery pump in accordance with another  embodiment of the invention;   FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a drug-delivery pump in   accordance with one embodiment of the invention;   FIG. 4 is a graph representing an example of how each of  the drug-delivery pumps depicted in FIGS. 1-3 may adapt to  changing conditions within the pump to deliver a target dos  age level;   FIG. 5A illustrates exemplary flow and actuation profiles   of a pump that operates without feedback control;   50   55   60   65   \fUS 9,283,322 B2   5  FIG.5B illustrates exemplary flow and actuation profiles of  a pump whose actuator is actuated for a longer period of time  as the pump's efficiency decreases;   FIG.5C illustrates exemplary flow and actuation profiles of  a pump whose actuation current is increased as the pump's  efficiency decreases; and   FIG. 6 is a sectional view of a patient\u2019s eye illustrating  implantation therein of a drug-delivery pump in accordance  with one embodiment of the invention.   DESCRIPTION   In general, embodiments of the present invention pertain to  external or implantable drug-delivery pumps (whether they  be reusable and refillable pumps, disposable pumps, etc.)  whose actuation may be dynamically and adaptively con  trolled.  For example, embodiments of the drug-delivery  pumps may be implantable within a patient\u2019s body, such as  within the patient\u2019s eye or brain. In certain embodiments, the  implantable drug-delivery pumps combine Small size and a  refillable drug reservoir. The small size minimizes discomfort  from the drug-delivery pump to the patient, while the refill  able reservoir allows the pump to be refilled in situ, rather  than having to be replaced. As such, a fluid, such as a Solution  of a drug, can be Supplied to the patient over extended periods  of time.  A. Exemplary Drug-Delivery Pump   Embodiments of the invention may be employed in con  nection with various types of drug-delivery pumps, whether  they be external pumps or pumps implantable within  a  patient\u2019s body. FIGS. 1 and 2 schematically illustrate two  variations of an exemplary implantable drug-delivery pump  100 (namely, an exemplary electrolytic or electrolysis-driven  pump 100) implanted within a patient\u2019s eye 104. The pump  100 may, however, instead be implanted in other portions of a  patient\u2019s body. For example, it may be implanted in the sub  arachnoid space of the brain to provide chemotherapy or to  provide another type of treatment for the brain (e.g., by dos  ing the brain's parenchyma directly); near a tumor in any  portion of the patient\u2019s body to provide chemotherapy; in a  pancreas that does not respond well to glucose to provide  agents (e.g., proteins, viral  vectors, etc.) that will trigger  insulin release; external to a patient but with a cannula placed  under the skin or inside the abdominal cavity to deliver insu  lin; in the knee to provide drugs that will treat osteoarthritis or  other cartilage diseases; near the spine to provide pain medi  cations or anti-inflammatories; or elsewhere.   As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, embodiments of the pump  100 may include two main components: a pair of chambers  108, 112 surrounded, at least in part, by a wall 115, and a  cannula 120. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the wall 115 that sur  rounds the chambers 108, 112 may include or consist of a  stand-alone parylene film 116 and, thereover, a separate pro  tection shell 128 made of a relatively rigid biocompatible  material (e.g., medical-grade polypropylene). Alternatively,  as illustrated in FIG. 2, the wall 115 may correspond only to  the protective shell 128, which may be coated with parylene.  The top chamber 108 defines a drug reservoir that, when  being used to treat a patient, may contain the drug to be  administered in liquid form. For its part, the bottom chamber  112 may contain a liquid that, when Subjected to electrolysis,  evolves a gaseous product. For example, that liquid may be  water, which may be electrolytically separated by an applied  Voltage into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. Alternatively, as  other examples, the electrolyte liquid may be a saline Solution  (i.e., NaCl in HO) or a solution that contains either magne  sium sulfate or sodium sulfate. In one embodiment, the two   6  chambers 108, 112 are separated by a corrugated diaphragm  124. In other words, the diaphragm 124 provides a fluid  barrier between the two chambers 108, 112. Like the stand  alone film 116, the diaphragm 124 may be constructed from,  for example, parylene.   As illustrated in FIG.1, the stand-alone film 116 may act as  an outer barrier for the drug reservoir 108 and the protective  shell 128 may provide a hard surface against which the film  116 exerts pressure. In such a case, the shell 128 may be  perforated to allow for eye, brain, or other bodily fluid move  ment. Alternatively, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the protective  shell  128 may itself act as the outer barrier for the drug  reservoir 108 and be unperforated. In both embodiments  depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, the protective shell 128 may  prevent outside pressure from being exerted on the drug res  ervoir 108. As illustrated in FIG. 1, a bottom portion 126 (i.e.,  a floor 126) of the protective shell 128 may include suture  holes 130. Similarly, although not shown in either FIG. 1 or  FIG. 2, the cannula 120 may also include suture holes along  its sides. The suture holes 130 may be employed in suturing  (i.e., anchoring) the pump 100 in place in the patient\u2019s body.  As also illustrated in FIG. 1, to provide power to the pump  100 and to enable data transmission therewith, a battery and  control circuitry 132 may be embedded (e.g., hermetically  sealed) under the chambers 108, 112 (i.e., between a bottom  portion of the stand-alone parylene film 116 of the drug  reservoir 108 and the floor 126 of the protective shell 128),  and an induction coil 136 may be integrated in the protective  shell 128 (e.g., by injection molding). FIG. 2 more clearly  illustrates a hermetic case 135 for housing the battery and  conventional control circuitry 132, but, for simplicity, does  not depict the components housed therein. The hermetic case  135 may be made from biocompatible metals (e.g., titanium)  or metal alloys. The bottom of the hermetic case 135 may be  flat, or it may be concave to help the implantable pump 100 fit  on the patient\u2019s eye 104.   In one embodiment, the induction coil 136 permits wireless  (e.g.,  radio-frequency)  communication  with  an  external  device (e.g., a handset). The handset may be used to send  wireless signals to the control circuitry 132 in order to pro  gram, reprogram, operate, calibrate, or otherwise configure  the pump 100. In one embodiment, the control circuitry 132  communicates electrically with electrolysis electrodes 134 in  the electrolyte chamber 112 by means of metal interconnects  (vias) 138 spanning a bottom portion of the electrolyte reser  voir 112. The electrolysis electrodes 134 may be made from,  for example, platinum, gold, and/or other metal(s). As further  described below, the control circuitry 132 controls the pump  ing action of the pump 100, including the below-described  closed-loop control process.   In one embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 1, the cannula  120 connects the drug reservoir 108 to a check valve 140  inserted at the site of administration. The check valve 140  may be a one-way check valve that prevents the backflow of  any fluid into the drug reservoir 108. Alternatively, or in  addition, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the check valve 140 may be  integral with and located at a proximal end of the cannula 120  (i.e.,  at the end closest to the drug reservoir 108). More  generally, however, the check valve 140 may be located any  where along the cannula 120. In addition, one or more flow  sensors 144 for monitoring the flow of the drug, and thereby  enabling the measurement of the drug Volume delivered and/  or the flow rate of the drug through the cannula 120, may be  associated with one or more of a proximal, middle, or distal  portion of the cannula 120. Optionally, as illustrated in FIG.1.  one or more target site sensor(s) 148 may also be integrated at  a distal end of the cannula 120 (i.e., at the end furthest from   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   \fUS 9,283,322 B2   7  the drug reservoir 108) in order to measure one or more  parameters at the site of administration (e.g., the intravitreal  chamber, shoulder capsule, knee capsule, cerebral Ventricals,  spinal canal, etc.). For example, the target site sensor(s) 148  may be employed to sense one or more of a change in a  biological or biochemical parameter at the target site (e.g., a  change in a specific analyte concentration, the presence or  absence of a specific biochemical marker, etc.), a change in  electrical activity at the target site (which may, for example,  be brought on by a physiological change), and a change in  pressure at the target site. In one embodiment, the target site  sensor(s)  148 provide feedback (i.e.,  real-time measure  ments) to the control circuitry 132 so that the flow of drug may  be metered by a closed-loop control process. For example,  increased pressure in the drug target region may warrant a  decrease in the flow of drug from the pump 100.   As illustrated in FIG. 1, the cannula 120 may be an exten  sion of the stand-alone parylene film 116. Alternatively, as  illustrated in FIG. 2, the cannula 120 may be a separate  component (e.g., a parylene component) that is coupled to the  protective shell 128. For example, a proximal end of the  cannula 120 may be inserted through a fluid connection port  formed in the protective shell 128 and bonded thereto by way  of e.g., a biocompatible epoxy glue 150. A silicone sheath  154 may be placed around a portion of the cannula 120 (see  FIG. 2), but this is optional (see FIG. 1).   In one embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 1, a fill port 152  is assembled with the drug reservoir 108 and sealed by a  sealant (e.g., a biocompatible epoxy) 156 to the stand-alone  film 116 and protective shell 128. In yet another embodiment,  as illustrated in FIG. 2, a hole may be formed through the  protective shell 128 and the fill port 152 featured therein. In  still another embodiment, the fill port 152 may be formed  elsewhere on the pump 100 and be connected to the drug  reservoir 108 through tubing. For example, the fill port 152  may be molded from biocompatible materials, coupled to a  matching notch on the hermetic case 135, and connected to  the drug reservoir 108 through the tubing. In one embodi  ment, the tubing is inserted through a fluid connection port  formed in a wall surrounding the drug reservoir 108 and  bonded thereto by way of a biocompatible epoxy glue. In  either case, the fill port 152 is in fluid communication with the  drug reservoir 108 and permits an operator of the pump 100  (e.g., a physician) to refill the drug reservoir 108 in situ (e.g.,  while the pump 100 is implanted within the patient\u2019s eye  104). In general, the drug reservoir 108 can be refilled by  inserting a refill needle into and through the fill port 152.   In various embodiments, the main parts of the pump 100  (i.e., the pair of chambers 108, 112 and the cannula 120) are  amenable to  monolithic  microfabrication  and integration  using multiple parylene layer processes. The fill port 152, the  protective shell 128, and other components may be assembled  with the pump 100 after the microfabrication steps.   In operation, when current is Supplied to the electrolysis  electrodes 134, the electrolyte evolves gas, expanding the  corrugated diaphragm 124 (i.e., moving the diaphragm 124  upwards in FIGS. 1 and 2) and forcing liquid (e.g., drug) out  of the drug reservoir 108, into and through the cannula 120,  and out the distal end thereof to the targeted site of adminis  tration. The corrugations or other folds in the expandable  diaphragm 124 permit a large degree of expansion, without  sacrificing volume within the drug reservoir 108 when the  diaphragm 124 is relaxed. When the current is stopped, the  electrolyte gas condenses back into its liquid State, and the  diaphragm 124 recovers its space-efficient corrugations.  B. Adaptive Control Based Upon Internal Pump Conditions   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   8  In general, the response of the electrolysis-driven pump  100 to a given input current supplied to the electrolysis elec  trodes 134 depends on how much liquid is remaining in the  drug reservoir 108. For example, if the drug reservoir 108 is  nearly empty, more current is needed to bring the drug reser  voir 108 to its \u201cfull  configuration before pressure can begin  to buildup and pumping can commence. On the other hand, if  the drug reservoir 108 is completely full, very little current is  needed before delivery of the drug begins. Similarly, the  response of the electrolysis-driven pump 100 to a given input  current also depends on the gas/liquid ratio in the electrolysis  chamber 112. In particular, the response of the pump 100 will  be very different when the drug reservoir 108 is full with drug  (e.g., when the electrolysis chamber 112 operates with a low  gas/liquid ratio) than when the drug reservoir 108 is nearly  empty (e.g., when the electrolysis chamber 112 operates with  a high gas/liquid ratio). In addition, other factors can cause  the response of the electrolysis-driven pump 100 to change  over time including, for example, degradation of the elec  trolysis electrodes 134, changes in the concentration of the  electrolyte in the electrolysis chamber 112, changes in the  flow characteristics of the check valve 140, and restrictions  that format the output of the cannula 120 due to tissue growth  or some other mechanism.   Because of these factors, the electrolysis pump 100 is  inherently variable. Accordingly, adaptive control in accor  dance herewith can confer Substantial advantages upon the  pump 100. For example, as further explained below, by ana  lyzing  previous  doses  to  ascertain  how the  pump 100  responded to given input currents, the optimal settings (e.g.,  the settings which give the most accurate and shortest dose)  for the current dose can be derived. This can be particularly  beneficial when the dose volume is small compared to the  volume of the drug reservoir 108. In such a situation, the state  parameters of the pump 100 (e.g., the drug Volume remaining  in the drug reservoir 108, the liquid/gas ratio in the electroly  sis chamber 112, the condition of the electrodes 134, the  characteristics of the check valve 140, etc.) are nearly iden  tical from one dose to the immediately following dose, and, as  Such, the previous doses are an excellent predictor for the  current dose.   FIG.3 is a block diagram of a drug-delivery pump 200 that  depicts the control circuitry 132 in greater detail. The drug  delivery pump 200 may be any type of external or internal  pump having an actuator 204 that forces the liquid from the  drug reservoir 108 into and through the cannula 120. For  example, the drug-delivery pump 200 may be an electrolysis  driven pump and, with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2 described  above, the pump actuator 204 may include the electrolyte  chamber 112, the expandable diaphragm 124, and the elec  trolysis electrodes 134. For its part, the control circuitry 132  includes computer memory 208 for storing one or more con  ditions of the pump 200, and an adaptive controller 212 for  controlling the pump actuator 204 based on a change in a  condition of the pump 200. Optionally, the control circuitry  132 may also include one or more module(s) to convert raw  data received from the flow sensor 144 into a meaningful  value (e.g.,  into a flow rate in nL/min) and/or to convert  similarly raw data received from the pump actuator 204 into  a meaningful value. Alternatively, the functions performed by  such module(s) may instead be performed by the adaptive  controller 212.   The computer memory 208 may be implemented as any  type of Volatile or non-volatile (e.g., Flash) memory, while  the adaptive controller 212 and/or the module(s) described  above may each be implemented as any software program,  hardware device, or combination thereof that is capable of   \fUS 9,283,322 B2   providing the functionality described herein. For example,  the adaptive controller 212 and/or the module(s) described  above may each be an application-specific integrated circuit  (ASIC) or a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Alterna  tively, the adaptive controller 212 may be implemented using  a general-purpose microprocessor (e.g., any of the PEN  TIUM microprocessors supplied by Intel Corp.) that is pro  grammed using any suitable programming language or lan  guages (e.g., C++, C#, Java, Visual Basic, LISP, BASIC,  PERL, etc.). Suitable control programming is straightfor  wardly implemented by those of skill in the art without undue  experimentation.   In one particular embodiment, as further described below,  the control circuitry 132 is programmed to deliver a fixed  dosage of the drug from the drug reservoir 108 to the target  site at periodic time intervals, and is configured to store the  conditions of the pump 200 at each of those time intervals in  the computer memory 208. Some exemplary and non-limit  ing conditions internal to the pump 200 that may be stored at  each dosing interval (or at other periodic intervals) include  the current through, Voltage across, or resistance of the elec  trolysis electrodes 134; the total electrical charge used to  drive the electrolysis electrodes 134; the maximum flow rate  of the drug through the cannula 120; any variations in flow  patterns of the drug through the cannula 120; the actuation  time required for the pump 200 to achieve a particular flow  rate of the drug through the cannula 120; the time required for  the flow of drug to ramp down from a particular flow rate to a  flow rate of Zero; the time delay between the initial actuation  of the pump 200 and the initial flow of drug through the  cannula 120; the efficiency of the pump actuator 204 (which,  in the case of an electrolysis-driven pump 200, may be  defined as the ratio between the amount of charge pumped  through the actuator 204 and the amount of gas generated  thereby); the internal pressure of the drug reservoir 108; the  acceleration experienced by the pump 200;  flow  sensor  parameters particular to the flow sensor 144 architecture (e.g.,  where the flow sensor 144 is a resistive temperature detector,  the resistance of the sensor and heater elements may be  stored); and the physical dimensions of the pump actuator  204, the drug reservoir 108, and/or the cannula 120, which  may change due to blockages, Scarring, or other biochemical/  physiological events.   In one embodiment, these parameters are measured either  directly or indirectly by using physical sensors, such as, for  example, the flow sensor(s) 144, pressure sensors in the drug  reservoir 108 or cannula 120, accelerometers, gyroscopes,  altimeters, sensors in proximity to the electrolysis electrodes  134 (to measure, for example, their resistance, the current  passing therethrough, and/or the Voltage thereat or there  across), or any other sensor dispersed throughout the pump  200. In other embodiments, these parameters are determined  by using known relationships. For example, the flow rate of  the drug through the cannula 120 may be determined by using  a pressure sensor in the cannula 120 and by utilizing the  well-known linear relationship between pressure and flow  rate. In still other embodiments, many of these parameters  may ascertained by analyzing the electrical waveforms used  to drive the pump actuator 204, and/or by analyzing the flow  profiles sensed by the flow sensor(s) 144.   In all cases, as further described below, the adaptive con  troller 212 of the control circuitry 132 can receive and process  this parameter data and compensate for any change in a con  dition of the pump 200 in order to adjust its operation to  maintain a target dosage level. This \u201cself-compensation' may  be achieved by storing, as mentioned above, parameter data  from the pump 200 state at the time of the previous dosages   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   10  and by considering real-time parameter values to determine  the optimal actuation current for the electrolysis electrodes  134 and/or their actuation duration at the next dosing event.  For example, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the adaptive controller  212 may receive, analyze, and process the stored parameters  from previous doses, real-time data from the pump actuator  204, and real-time data from the flow sensor(s) 144 (e.g., flow  rate data) to ascertain and direct appropriate output signals to  the pump actuator 204 (i.e., in order to drive the pump 200 in  the appropriate manner). For initial dosing, or in cases where  the above-described data may be unavailable (e.g., due to a  reset action in the pump 200), the adaptive controller 212 may  employ a set of pre-defined reference parameter values. These  reference values may be specific to the characteristics of the  particular pump 200 employed, for example specific to the  types of electrolysis electrodes 134 employed, the type of  electrolytic solution used, and/or the physical dimensions of  the pump actuator 204, drug reservoir 108, and cannula 120.  In one mode of operating an electrolysis-driven pump 200,  the electrolysis electrodes 134 are driven using a constant  current for a variable amount of time. In this mode, the con  stant current results in a monotonic rise in the flow rate of the  drug through the cannula 120 until the current is shut off, at  which point the residual pressure in the pump 200 gives rise  to a slow decay in the flow rate until the flow rate reaches zero.  In one functional example for this mode of operation, the  following  three  parameters  are  stored  in  the  computer  memory 208 at each dosing interval: the current supplied to  the electrolysis electrodes 134 in order to drive the pump 200  (I); the maximum flow rate of the drug through the cannula  120 (F); and the Volume of liquid (i.e., drug) that is deliv  ered by the pump 200, due to residual pressure, after the pump  actuator 204 is deactivated (V). This stored information  is then used, in future doses, to improve the dosing speed and  accuracy. For example, the current used to drive future doses  may be adjusted based on previous dose data (e.g., increased  if the maximum flow rate is too low, and decreased if the  maximum flow rate is too high) in order to keep the duration  of each dose, and the volume of the drug delivered on each  dose, relatively consistent. In one embodiment, this is done in  a linear fashion as follows:   XI   naxprevious  previous   I  Footina/  current  op  where I  is the current to be supplied to the electrolysis  is the desired  electrodes 134 during the current dose, F  maximum flow rate of the drug through the cannula 120,  F,  was the maximum flow rate of the drug through  the cannula 120 during the previous dose, and I  was the  current supplied to the electrolysis electrodes 134 during the  previous dose.   As another example, the shut-off time of the pump actuator  204 may instead, or in addition, be adjusted (e.g., shut offlater  if the volume of the liquid delivered after the pump actuator  204 is deactivated is lower than expected, and shut off earlier  if the volume of the liquid delivered after the pump actuator  204 is deactivated is higher than expected) in order to keep the  volume of the drug delivered relatively consistent. Once  again, this may be done using a linear approximation, where  the pump actuator 204 is deactivated as soon as the following  condition is met:   accumulateaf/in axforeviozas   shutofprevious  V. iarget   where V  is the total volume of the drug delivered so  far in the current dose, F is the real-time flow rate of the drug  was the maximum flow  through the cannula 120, F,  rate of the drug through the cannula 120 from the previous  was the volume of the drug delivered  dose, V   Shutoff previous   \fUS 9,283,322 B2   11  after the pump actuator 204 was shut off in the previous dose,  and V,  is the target volume of the drug to be delivered. In  this manner, the adaptive controller 212 constantly adjusts the  way in which the pump 200 is actuated, and accounts for  systematic, non-random changes in the pump 200 character  istics.   Determining and controlling both the amount of current  needed to initiate the flow of drug through the cannula 120  and then to reach a particular flow rate, as well as the amount  of liquid delivered from the drug reservoir 108 after the cur  rent is no longer applied to the electrolysis electrodes 134, is  of particular benefit when the pump 200 is an electrolysis  driven pump. In particular, the first parameter is important  because the amount of current needed to initiate the flow of  drug through the cannula 120 and to reach a particular flow  rate depends on how much liquid is left in the drug reservoir  108. Using too low a current would be power-inefficient,  since all systems would be running even though there would  be no or very low flow of drug through the cannula 120. On  the other hand, using too high a current could cause the flow  rate of the drug to overshoot to unsafe levels. The second  parameter is also of importance since the Volume of drug  delivered after the pump 200 is turned off is dependent pri  marily on the gas/liquid ratio in the electrolysis chamber 112.  For doses later in the life-cycle of the pump 200 (e.g., where  the pump 200 runs with a high gas/liquid ratio in the elec  trolysis chamber 112), there is much more gas that needs to be  dissipated before the pump 200 can fully stop. The opposite is  true for earlier doses.   As will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, in  addition to the two examples given above, the adaptive con  troller 212 may recognize and analyze  numerous other  changes in conditions internal to the pump 200 when control  ling the pump actuator 204 and, ultimately, the dispensing of  the drug from the drug reservoir 108. For example, there may  be situations where is it desirable for the pump 200 to reach an  optimal flow rate (F) for each dose in a specified period  of time (t) and to then maintain that flow rate for the  remainder of the dose. One way to achieve this is to begin  each dose by using a constant current (I) to drive the  electrolysis electrodes 134 of the pump 200 until the optimal  flow rate (F) is reached, at which point feedback from  the flow sensor 144 and an algorithm (e.g., a proportional  integral-derivative (\u201cPID) algorithm or another algorithm)  may be used to adjust the current Supplied to the electrolysis  electrodes 134 to maintain that optimal flow rate (F) for  the remainder of the dose. In other words, the pump 200 may  be driven using a time-varying current waveform. In one  embodiment, in  order to  achieve the  optimal flow  rate  (F) in the specified period of time (t), the starting  current (I) is adjusted from dose to dose. In a manner  similar to before, this can be done, for example, using a linear  approximation (although, as will be understood by one of  ordinary skill in the art, non-linear approximations may also  be employed for any of the parameters derived herein). More  specifically,  the  starting  current  for  the  current  dose  (Ise) can be calculated using the starting current  from the previous dose (Ini) and the time it took  for the flow rate to reach the optimal flow rate (F) in the  ), as follows:  previous dose (   previous   starting current  'previous/optima px. iariiragoreviozas   Referring now to FIG. 4, an exemplary graph 300 illustrat  ing the effects of the above-described adaptive control on the  drug dosage level is depicted. In this example, the target  dosage level to be delivered during each release event is 200  nanoliters (nl). Event 1 corresponds to an initial dosing of   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   12  180 n  based on calculations using the reference parameter  values. The adaptive controller 212 then calculates appropri  ate  adjustments  to  the  pump 200 parameters  (e.g.,  as  described above, the amount of current supplied to the elec  trolysis electrodes 134 and/or the actuation time thereof may  be increased in order to increase the volume of drug delivered  to the target site) until a target delivery of 200 mL is achieved  at Event 2. As illustrated, there may be a point 304 in time  between Event 1 and Event 2 during which the adaptive  controller 212 overcompensates and the pump 200 delivers  more than the target dosage (e.g., 205 nL). In this case, the  adaptive controller 212 refines its adjustments to the pump  200 parameters (e.g., as described above, the amount of cur  rent supplied to the electrolysis electrodes 134 and/or the  actuation time thereof may be decreased in order to decrease  the volume of drug delivered to the target site) until the target  delivery of 200 mL is in fact achieved at Event 2.   Continuing with the example depicted in the graph 300 of  FIG. 4, the dosage at Event 3 then drops to 190 mL due to a  change in one or more of the pump 200 parameters. Exem  plary conditions within the pump 200 itself that may change  and lead to Such a decrease in the dosage of the drug delivered  (i.e., to a decrease in the efficiency of the pump 200) can  include the degradation (e.g., erosion or corrosion) of the  electrolysis electrodes 134, a decrease in the concentration of  the electrolytes in the solution present in the electrolysis  chamber 112, and/or general mechanical or chemical wear. In  response, the adaptive controller 212 then compensates as  described above so that the pump 200 releases the correct  amount of drug at Event 4. The pump 200 thus dynamically  reacts to changing conditions of the pump 200.   FIG. 5A depicts exemplary flow profiles 400 and actuation  profiles 404 for a pump that operates without the feedback  control provided by the control circuitry 132 (e.g., for a pump  employing an open-loop control system). As shown, the  amount of drug delivered at later times decreases even though  the actuation current remains the same (the actuation profiles  404 for the earlier and later doses overlap in FIG. 5A), due to  decreasing pump efficiency.   FIG. 5B depicts exemplary flow profiles 408 and actuation  profiles 412 for a pump 200 that operates with the feedback  control provided by the control circuitry 132. In particular,  FIG. 5B shows how increasing the pumping time for a later  dose can compensate for reduced pump 200 efficiency. More  specifically, for the later dose, the pump 200 actuates for a  longer period of time at the same current in order to Success  fully deliver the target dosage amount.   FIG. 5C also depicts exemplary flow profiles 416 and  actuation profiles 420 for a pump 200 that operates with the  feedback control provided by the control circuitry 132. In  particular, FIG.5C shows how the dosing time for the earlier  and later doses can be kept constant while still compensating  for decreased pump 200 efficiency by increasing the actuation  current of the later dose. The flow profiles 416 for the earlier  and later doses overlap, illustrating that the same amount of  drug is delivered during both dosages.  C. Adaptive Control Based Upon Conditions of the Target  Site   In other embodiments, with reference again to FIGS. 1-3,  the adaptive controller 212 can also receive information from  the target site sensor(s) 148 that monitor the drug-delivery  treatment area, and thereafter change the target dosage for  certain time periods. More particularly, if changes in the  treatment area (e.g., worsening or improvement of symptoms,  changes in biological or biochemical parameters, changes in  electrical activity, changes in pressure, etc.) require a higher  or lower dosing level or a change in the frequency of dosages,   \fUS 9,283,322 B2   13  the adaptive controller 212 can control the pump actuator 204  So as to adjust the dosage and maintain it at a new level until  another change is required. In other words, the adaptive con  troller 212 may actuate the pump 200 to achieve a desired  result, such as the regulation of a specific physiological State  or biochemical parameter. As before, the parameters sensed  by the target sensor(s) 148 (e.g., pressure, temperature, etc.)  may be stored in the computer memory 208 for later use (e.g.,  for comparison in determining the appropriate dosage of drug  to be delivered).   As an example, assume that the pump 200 delivers an  initial target dosage of 200 mL every 30 minutes. After a  period of time, either due to a change in the treatment area or  dosing regimen, the dosage may need to be decreased to 150  nL. The adaptive controller 212 may then operate the pump  actuator 204 so as to deliver 150 nL of the drug every 30  minutes until instructed otherwise, either by another change  in the treatment area or by a user of the pump 200.   Advantageously, this flexibility facilitates the use of the  pump 200 with a wide range of treatment regimens that may  require the staggering of different dosages or dosage frequen  cies over prolonged periods of time.   Optionally,  the  adaptive  controller  212  may be pro  grammed to respond to both a change in a condition of the  pump 200 itselfand, at the same time, to a change in condition  of the target treatment area. In other words, the adaptive  controller 212 may receive data from both sensors or other  devices internal to the pump 200 and from the target site  sensor(s) 148, analyze both sets of data, and control the pump  actuator 204 to account for both sets of data. Alternatively, in  another embodiment, if the deterministic parameters are to be  those of the pump 200 itself rather than those of the treatment  area, the adaptive controller 212 may be programmed to  refrain from initiating actions based on, for example, block  ages that may form within the target area due to physiological  changes or Scarring.  D. Exemplary Uses of the Dynamic, Adaptively Controlled  Drug-Delivery Pumps   FIG. 6 schematically illustrates a drug-delivery pump 100,  200 implanted in the eye of a patient in accordance with one  embodiment of the invention. As illustrated, the pump 100,  200 is placed upon the conjunctiva of the eye, and a distal end  of the cannula 120 is inserted therethrough in to the posterior  chamber of the eye. As such, the distal end of the cannula 120  (and, hence, the drug reservoir 108) is in fluid communication  with the patient.  The drug-delivery pump 100, 200 then  administers a therapeutic liquid to the posterior chamber of  the eye through the cannula 120 and the check valve 140,  which, as previously mentioned, may be employed to prevent  the backflow of the liquid. In particular, the pump actuator  204 may be controlled through use of the adaptive controller  212 and the other control circuitry 132 in any of the manners  described hereinabove (e.g., based on a change in a condition  of the pump itself and/or based on conditions of the target  site) so as to deliver one or more dosages of the liquid from the  drug reservoir 108, through the cannula 120, and into the  patient\u2019s eye.   In other embodiments, the pump 100,200 is used to admin  ister the liquid to the anterior chamber of the eye, which is  separated from the posterior chamber by the lens. More gen  erally, however, the pump 100, 200 may, as previously men  tioned, be employed to administer liquid to any portion of the  patient\u2019s body.   As an additional example, the pump 100, 200 may be a  body-adhered electrolysis-driven pump for the infusion of  medication into a patient\u2019s Subcutaneous tissue. For example,  the pump 100, 200 may continuously deliver insulin to the   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   14  patient\u2019s body over three to seven days. A patient may need,  however, to  recalculate his  or her insulin delivery (e.g.,  increase or decrease basal rates over time), as well as program  the pump 100, 200 to give an intermittent bolus spike of  insulin after a meal. Accordingly, the pump 100, 200 in this  example can adapt the electrolysis to increase or decrease the  flow of insulin to accurately deliver the correct fluidic vol  umes over time. Furthermore, infusion of a drug over an  extended period of time, such as three days, may subject the  pump 100,  200  to  new  environmental  conditions.  For  example, a patient may drive from low to high altitudes or fly  in a pressurized plane. The pump 100, 200 can use both  environmental signals (e.g., altimeter, pressure change, flow  rate change, etc.) to adjust the flow of the drug and to ensure  the accurate delivery of the drug.   As yet another example, the pump 100, 200 may use input  from an accelerometer or gyroscope in  order to  sense a  patient\u2019s position. For example, the pump 100,200 may sense  that the patient was horizontal during the hours of 10 pm to 6  am for the previous 7 days (because, for example, the patient  was sleeping). In this case, the pump 100, 200 may then  recognize the patients sleep time (i.e.,  from sensing the  patient to be in a horizontal position) or REM sleep cycle and  then use that information to infuse a different volume of drug  (or drug at specific times) to accommodate optimal condi  tions. For example, the flow rate of the pump 100, 200 may be  adjusted to an amount pre-prescribed by a physician for infu  sion during sleep (e.g., it is often best to inject Some glaucoma  medications to a patient\u2019s eye during REM sleep cycle in  order to better distribute the medication throughout the eye,  while some medications such as Anti-VEGF drugs for the  retina act over a period of a month and should be injected  calmly into the vitreous; in addition, a lower basal rate of  insulin or less pain medication may be injected during sleep).  In contrast to understanding when a patient is sleeping, the  pump 100, 200 may also recognize when the patient is exer  cising or when the patient is not Supine, and adjust its infusion  of drug accordingly (e.g., such as to that which is pre-pro  grammed by the physician for infusion during certain activi  ties).   Advantageously, the control circuitry 132 described herein  can be employed for pumps that are not uniform in their  characteristics, either due to  user-selected preferences or  variations arising during the manufacturing process. The  types  of electrodes  and electrolytic  solution  used,  for  example, determine the performance of electrolysis-driven  pumps. The control circuitry 132 is, however, robust and  Versatile enough to accommodate pumps that operate across  a wide range of parameter values. As another example, manu  facturing process variations in the resistance of the flow sen  Sor elements can be mitigated by the adaptive nature of the  control circuitry 132. More specifically, mismatched resis  tances in the flow sensor elements resulting from the process  variations will result in an offset for which the control cir  cuitry 132 can compensate.   Optionally, the control circuitry 132 may also serve to  enhance safety and efficacy of the pump 100, 200 by moni  toring certain key pump parameters. For example, acceptable  ranges may be defined for each parameter or for some overall  combination of parameters corresponding to a specific pump  state, during which the pump 100, 200 continues to operate  normally. Should an individual parameter or some combina  tion of parameters not fall within these pre-defined ranges, an  action may then be triggered within the pump 100, 200, such  as shutting off or alerting the user that a response is required.  For example, the pump 100, 200 may alter a patient by illu  mination, Sound, vibration, or shock. In one embodiment, the   \fUS 9,283,322 B2   15  alert is programmed to occur when the patient is moving to  maximize the likelihood that the patient will receive the alert  and also to conserve battery power by avoiding alerts while  the patient is sleeping.   In one particular example, the control circuitry 132 can  respond to and predict the failure of a flow sensor 144. Where,  for example, the flow sensor 144 includes a group of heaters  and resistive temperature detectors, one of its elements may  begin to fail after an indeterminate number of doses due to  thermal stresses experienced during its use. The control cir  cuitry 132 can monitor the resistance of the heater elements  periodically (e.g., from dose to dose) and detect changes in  resistance that may indicate the start of failure or outright  failure (such as an open-circuit). Other pump components  including sensors and actuators that employ resistive  or  capacitive elements can likewise be monitored by the control  circuitry 132 to ensure proper functional operation.   Having described certain embodiments of the invention, it  will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other  embodiments incorporating the concepts disclosed herein  may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the  invention. For example, although the adaptive controller 212  and the  other control  circuitry  132 has primarily  been  described for use in connection with an electrolysis-driven  pump, this is for illustrative purposes only. Those of ordinary  skill in the art will readily appreciate and understand that the  adaptive controller 212 and the other control circuitry 132  may also be usefully employed in other types of drug-delivery  pumps, such as those that rely on, for example, electroosmo  sis,  mechanical actuation, or pressure-driven mechanisms.  Accordingly, the described embodiments are to be considered  in all respects as only illustrative and not restrictive.   What is claimed is:  1.

Many embodiments  provide a swallowable device for delivering the agents.  Particular embodiments provide a swallowable device such  as a capsule for delivering drugs into the intestinal wall or  other GI lumen.  Embodiments also provide various drug  preparations that are configured to be contained within the  capsule, advanced from the capsule into the intestinal wall  and degrade to release the drug into the bloodstream to  produce a therapeutic effect. The preparation can be oper  ably coupled to delivery means having a first configuration  where the preparation is  contained in the capsule and a  second configuration where the preparation is advanced out  of the capsule into the intestinal wall. Embodiments of the  invention are particularly useful for the delivery of drugs  which are poorly absorbed, tolerated and/or degraded within  the GI tract.   21 Claims, 46 Drawing Sheets   \fUS 9.486.414 B2  Page 2   (56)   References Cited   U.S. PATENT DOCUMENTS   6,743,211  6,975,906  7,083,578  7,083,579  7,393,827   B1  B2  B2  B2  B2   6, 2004  12, 2005  8, 2006  8, 2006  T/2008   Prausnitz et al.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   Field of the Invention   Embodiments of the invention relate to swallowable drug  delivery devices.  More specifically,  embodiments of the  invention relate to swallowable drug delivery devices for  delivering drugs to the Small intestine.   While there has been an increasing development of new  drugs in  recent years for the treatment of a  variety  of  diseases, many have limited application because they cannot  be given orally. This is due to a number of reasons including:  poor oral toleration  with complications including gastric  irritation and bleeding; breakdown/degradation of the drug  compounds in the stomach; and poor, slow or erratic absorp  tion of the drug. Conventional alternative drug delivery  methods such as  intravenous and intramuscular delivery  have a number of drawbacks including pain and risk of  infection from a needle Stick, requirements for the use of  sterile technique and the requirement and associated risks of  maintaining an IV line in a patient for an extended period of  time.  While other  drug delivery  approaches  have been  employed Such as implantable drug delivery pumps, these  approaches require the semi-permanent implantation of a  device and can still  have many of the limitations of IV  delivery. Thus, there is a need for an improved method for  delivery of drugs and other therapeutic agents, including a  need for improved delivery of liraglutide and other thera  peutic agents for the treatment of diabetes and other blood  glucose regulation disorders.   2  BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   Embodiments of the invention provide devices, systems,  kits and methods for delivering drugs and other therapeutic  agents to various locations in the body. Many embodiments  provide a swallowable device for delivering drugs and other  therapeutic agents within  the Gastrointestinal  (GI) tract.  Particular embodiments provide a swallowable device such  as a capsule for  delivering drugs and other therapeutic  agents into the wall of the Small intestine or other GI organ  wall. Embodiments of the invention are particularly useful  for the delivery of drugs and other therapeutic agents which  are poorly absorbed, poorly tolerated and/or degraded within  the GI tract. Further, embodiments of the invention can be  used to deliver drugs which were previously only capable of  or preferably delivered by intravenous or other form of  parenteral  administration  including  various  non-vascular  injected forms of administration Such as intramuscular or  Subcutaneous injection.   In one aspect of the invention, the invention provides a  therapeutic agent preparation for delivery into a wall of the  intestinal tract, the preparation comprises a therapeutically  effective dose of at least one therapeutic agent. The prepa  ration has a shape and material consistency to be contained  in a swallowable capsule or other swallowable device and  delivered from the capsule into the intestinal wall to release  the dose of therapeutic agent from within the intestinal wall.  In another embodiment, the invention provides a thera  peutic agent preparation for delivery into a wall of the  intestinal tract such as the wall of the small intestine, the  preparation comprises a therapeutically effective dose of at  least one therapeutic agent. The preparation is configured to  be contained in a Swallowable capsule and operably coupled  to an actuator, expandable balloon or other device having a  first configuration and a second configuration. The prepara  tion is contained within the capsule in the first configuration  and advanced out of the capsule and into the intestinal wall  in the second configuration to deliver the therapeutic agent  into the intestinal wall.   In other embodiments, the invention provides a method  for delivering a therapeutic agent into the wall of the small  intestine  comprising Swallowing a  drug delivery  device  comprising a capsule, an actuator and an embodiment of the  therapeutic agent preparation. The actuator is responsive to  a condition in the Small intestine Such as pH so as to actuate  delivery of the therapeutic agent preparation into the wall of  the Small intestine. In specific embodiments, the actuator can  comprise a release element or coating on the capsule which  is degraded by a selected pH in the small intestine. Once  degraded, the element or coating initiates delivery of the  therapeutic agent preparation by one or more delivery means  Such as the by expansion of one or more balloons that are  operably coupled to tissue penetrating members that contain  the therapeutic  agent preparation  and are  configured to  penetrate and be advanced into the intestinal  wall upon  expansion of the balloon. Once the tissue penetrating mem  bers are in the intestinal wall, they degrade to release the  therapeutic agent into the bloodstream. Because the thera  peutic agent preparation is delivered directly into the wall of  the small intestine,  the time period (described herein as  C) for achieving the  maximum concentration  of the  therapeutic agent in the bloodstream or other location in the  body is shorter than a corresponding time period for achiev  ing such a maximum concentration when the therapeutic  agent is  non-vascularly injected into the body Such as by  intramuscular or Subcutaneous injection. In various embodi  ments, the time period for achieving C  by insertion of the   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   3  therapeutic preparation into the intestinal wall using one or  more embodiments of the invention (such as an embodiment  of the swallowable device) can be 80%, 50%, 30%, 20 or  even 10% of the time period for achieving a C  through  the use of a non-vascular injection of the therapeutic agent.  In other embodiments, the C  achieved by insertion of the  therapeutic preparation into the intestinal wall using one or  more embodiments of the invention, Such as an embodiment  of the Swallowable device,  can be greater than a C,  achieved by taking a convention oral form of the therapeutic  agent (e.g., a pill) where the therapeutic agent is not inserted  into the intestinal wall. In various embodiments, the  achieved by insertion of the therapeutic preparation into the  intestinal  wall  using one or  more embodiments  of the  invention  (such  as  an  embodiment of the  swallowable  device) can be 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or even a 100  times greater than when the therapeutic agent is delivered in  a pill or other oral form. In other related embodiments, the  composition  can be configured to  produce a long-term  release of therapeutic agent with a selectable t/2, that is the  time period required for the concentration of the therapeutic  agent in the bloodstream or other location in the body to  reach half its original C  value after having reached C.  For example, the selectable t/2 may be 6, or 9, or 12, or 15  or 18, or 24 hours.   In another aspect, the invention provides a Swallowable  device for delivering a  drug or other therapeutic  agent  preparation into the wall of the Small or large intestine or  other organ of the gastro-intestinal tract organ. The devise  comprises a capsule sized to be Swallowed and pass through  the gastro-intestinal tract, a deployable aligner positioned  within the capsule for aligning a longitudinal axis of the  capsule with the a longitudinal axis of the Small intestine, a  delivery mechanism for delivering the therapeutic agent into  the intestinal wall and a deployment member for deploying  at least one of the aligner or the delivery mechanism. The  capsule wall is degradable by contact with liquids in the GI  tract but also may include an outer coating or layer which  only degrades in the higher pH's found in the Small intestine,  and serves to  protect the underlying capsule wall  from  degradation within the stomach before the capsule reaches  the  small  intestine at  which point the  drug delivery  is  initiated by degradation of the coating. In use. Such materials  allow for the targeted delivery of a therapeutic agent in a  selected portion of the intestinal  tract  such as the small  intestine. Suitable outer coatings can include various enteric  coatings such as various co-polymers of Methacrylic Acid  and Ethyl Acrylate.   Another embodiment of the capsule includes at least one  guide tube, one or more tissue penetrating members posi  tioned in the at least one guide tube, a delivery member and  an actuating mechanism. The tissue penetrating member will  typically comprise a hollow needle or other like structure  and will have a lumen and a tissue penetrating end for  penetrating a selectable depth into the intestinal wall.  In  various embodiments, the device can include a second and  a third tissue penetrating member with additional numbers  contemplated. Each tissue penetrating member can include  the same or a different  drug.  In  preferred embodiments  having multiple tissue penetrating members, the tissue pen  etrating members can be symmetrically distributed around  the perimeter of the capsule so as to anchor the capsule onto  the intestinal wall during delivery of drug. In some embodi  ments, all or a portion of the tissue penetrating member (e.g.,  the tissue penetrating end) can be fabricated from the drug  preparation itself.  In these and related embodiments, the  drug preparation can have a needle or dart-like structure   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   4  (with or without barbs) configured to  penetrate and be  retained in the intestinal wall.   The tissue penetrating member can be fabricated from  various biodegradable materials (e.g.,  PGLA, maltose or  other Sugar) so as to degrade within the Small intestine and  thus provide a fail-safe mechanism for detaching the tissue  penetrating member from the intestinal  wall should this  component become retained in the intestinal wall. Addition  ally, in theses and related embodiments, selectable portions  of the capsule can be fabricated from such biodegradable  materials so as to allow the entire device to controllably  degrade into Smaller pieces. Such embodiments facilitate  passage and excretion of the devices through GI tract.  In  particular embodiments, the capsule can include seams of  biodegradable material which controllably degrade to break  the capsule into pieces of a selectable size and shape to  facilitate passage through the GI tract. The seams can be  pre-stressed, perforated or otherwise treated to accelerate  degradation. The concept of using biodegradable seams to  produce controlled degradation of a swallowable device in  the GI tract can also be applied to other swallowable devices  Such as Swallowable cameras to facilitate passage through  the GI tract and reduce the likelihood of a device becoming  stuck in the GI tract.   The delivery member is configured to advance the drug  from the capsule through the tissue penetrating member  lumen and into  the intestinal  wall. Typically, at  least a  portion of the delivery member is advanceable within the  tissue penetrating member lumen. The delivery member can  have a piston or like structure sized to fit within the delivery  member lumen. The distal end of the delivery member (the  end which is  advanced into tissue)  can have a plunger  element which advances the drug within tissue penetrating  member lumen and also forms a seal with the lumen. The  plunger element can be integral or attached to the delivery  member. Preferably, the delivery member is configured to  travel a fixed distance within the needle lumen so as to  deliver a fixed or metered dose of drug into the intestinal  wall. This can be achieved by one or more of the selection  of the diameter of the delivery member (e.g., the diameter  can be distally tapered), the diameter of the tissue penetrat  ing member (which can be narrowed at its distal end), use of  a stop, and/or the actuating mechanism. For embodiments of  the device having a tissue penetrating member fabricated  from drug (e.g., a drug dart), the delivery member is adapted  to advance the dart out of the capsule and into tissue.   The delivery member and tissue penetrating member can  be configured for the delivery of liquid, semi-liquid or solid  forms of drug or all three. Solid forms of drug can include  both powder or pellet. Semi liquid can include a slurry or  paste. The drug can be contained within a cavity of the  capsule, or in the case of the liquid or semi-liquid, within an  enclosed reservoir. In some embodiments, the capsule can  include a first second, or a third drug (or more). Such drugs  can be contained within  the tissue  penetrating  member  lumen (in  the case of Solids  or powder) or in  separate  reservoirs within the capsule body.   The actuating mechanism can be coupled to at least one  of the tissue penetrating member or the delivery member.  The actuating mechanism is configured to advance the tissue  penetrating member a selectable distance into the intestinal  wall as well as advance the delivery member to deliver the  drug and then withdraw the tissue penetrating member from  the intestinal wall. In various embodiments, the actuating  mechanism can comprise a preloaded spring mechanism  which is configured to be released by the release element.  Suitable springs can include both coil (including conical   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   5  shaped springs) and leaf springs with other spring structures  also contemplated. In particular embodiments, the spring  can be cone shaped to reduce the length of the spring in the  compressed State even to the point where the compressed  length of the spring is about the thickness of several coils  (e.g., two or three) or only one coil.   In particular embodiments the actuating mechanism com  prises a spring, a first motion converter, and a second motion  converter  and a track  member. The release  element  is  coupled to the spring to retain the spring in a compressed  state Such that degradation of the release element releases  the  spring.  The first  motion converter is  configured to  convert motion of the spring to advance and withdraw the  tissue penetrating element in and out of tissue. The second  motion converter is  configured to convert motion of the  spring  to  advance the  delivery  member into  the  tissue  penetrating  member lumen.  The motion  converters  are  pushed by the spring and ride along a rod or other track  member which serves to guide the path of the converters.  They engage the tissue penetrating member and/or delivery  member (directly  or  indirectly)  to  produce the  desired  motion. They are desirably configured to convert motion of  the spring along its longitudinal axis into orthogonal motion  of the tissue penetrating member and/or delivery member  though conversion in other directions is also contemplated.  The motion converters can have a wedge, trapezoidal or  curved shape with other shapes also contemplated. In par  ticular embodiments, the first motion converter can have a  trapezoidal shape and include a slot which engages a pin on  the tissue penetrating member that rides in the slot. The slot  can have a trapezoidal  shape that  mirrors  or otherwise  corresponds to the overall shape of the converter and serves  to push the tissue penetrating member during the upslope  portion of the trapezoid and then pull it  back during the  down slope portion. In one variation, one or both of the  motion converters can comprise a cam or cam like device  which is turned by the spring and engages the tissue pen  etrating and/or delivery member.   In other variations, the actuating mechanism can also  comprise an electro-mechanical device/mechanism Such as a  Solenoid or a piezoelectric device. In one embodiment, the  piezoelectric device can comprise a shaped piezoelectric  element which has a non-deployed and deployed State. This  element can be configured to go into the deployed State upon  the application of a Voltage and then return to the non  deployed state upon the removal of the voltage. This and  related embodiments allow for a reciprocating motion of the  actuating  mechanism  so as  to  both  advance  the  tissue  penetrating member and then withdraw it.   The release element is  coupled to  at least one of the  actuating mechanism or a spring coupled to the actuating  mechanism. In particular embodiments, the release element  is coupled to a spring positioned within the capsule so as to  retain the spring in a compressed State. Degradation of the  release element releases the spring to actuate the actuation  mechanism.  In  many embodiments, the release element  comprises a material configured to degrade upon exposure to  chemical conditions in the Small or large intestine Such as  pH. Typically, the release element is configured to degrade  upon exposure to a selected pH in the Small intestine, e.g.,  7.0. 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0 or greater. However, it can also be  configured to degrade in response to other conditions in the  Small intestine. In particular embodiments, the release ele  ment can be configured to degrade in response to particular  chemical conditions in the fluids in the small intestine such  as those which occur after ingestion of a meal (e.g., a meal  high in fats or proteins).   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   6  Biodegradation of the release element from one or more  conditions in the small intestine (or other location in the GI  tract) can be achieved by selection of the materials for the  release element, the amount of cross linking of those mate  rials as well as the thickness and other dimensions of the  release elements. Lesser amounts of cross linking and or  thinner dimensions can increase the rate of degradation and  visa versa. Suitable materials for the release element can  comprise biodegradable materials such as various enteric  materials which are configured to degrade upon exposure to  the higher pH or other condition in the small intestine. The  enteric materials can be copolymerized or otherwise mixed  with one or more polymers to obtain a number of particular  material properties in addition to biodegradation. Such prop  erties  can  include  without  limitation  stiffness,  strength,  flexibility and hardness.   In particular embodiments, the release element can com  prise a film or plug that fits over or otherwise blocks the  guide tube and retains the tissue penetrating member inside  the guide tube. In these and related embodiments, the tissue  penetrating member is coupled to a spring loaded actuating  mechanism Such that when the release element is degraded  Sufficiently, it releases the tissue penetrating member which  then springs out of the guide tube to penetrate into the  intestinal wall. In other embodiments, the release element  can be shaped to function as a latch which holds the tissue  penetrating element in place. In these and related embodi  ments, the release element can be located on the exterior or  the interior of the capsule. In the interior embodiments, the  capsule and guide tubes are configured to allow for the  ingress of intestinal fluids into the capsule interior to allow  for the degradation of the release element.   In some embodiments, the actuating mechanism can be  actuated by means of a  sensor,  Such as  a pH or other  chemical sensor which detects the presence of the capsule in  the  Small  intestine  and sends a signal  to  the  actuating  mechanism (or to an electronic controller coupled to the  actuating mechanism to actuate the mechanism). Embodi  ments of a pH sensor can comprise an electrode-based  sensor or it can be a mechanically-based sensor Such as a  polymer which shrinks or expands upon exposure to the pH  or other chemical conditions in the small intestine. In related  embodiments, an expandable/contractable sensor can also  comprise the  actuating  mechanism  itself  by  using  the  mechanical motion from the expansion or contraction of the  SSO.   According to another embodiment for detecting that the  device is in the small intestine (or other location in the GI  tract),  the sensor can comprise a strain  gauge or other  pressure/force sensor for detecting the number of peristaltic  contractions that the capsule is  being Subject to within a  particular location in the intestinal tract.  In these embodi  ments, the capsule is desirably sized to be gripped by the  Small intestine  during a peristaltic  contraction.  Different  locations  within  the  GI tract  have  different  number of  peristaltic contractions. The small intestine has between 12  to 9 contractions per minute with the frequency decreasing  down the length of the intestine. Thus, according to one or  more embodiments detection of the number of peristaltic  contractions can be used to not only determine if the capsule  is in the small intestine but the relative location within the  intestine as well.   As an alternative or Supplement to internally activated  drug delivery, in Some embodiments, the user may exter  nally activate the actuating mechanism to deliver drug by  means of RF, magnetic or other wireless signaling means  known in the art. In these and related embodiments, the user   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   7  can use a handheld device (e.g., a hand held RF device)  which not only includes signaling means, but also means for  informing the user when the device is in the small intestine  or other location in the GI tract. The later embodiment can  be implemented by including an  RF transmitter on the  swallowable device to signal to the user when the device is  in the Small intestine or other location (e.g., by signaling an  input from the sensor). The same handheld device can also  be configured to alter the user when the actuating mecha  nism has been activated and the selected drug(s) delivered.  In this way, the user is provided confirmation that the drug  has  been  delivered.  This  allows  the  user  to  take  other  appropriate drugs/therapeutic agents as well as make other  related decisions (e.g., for diabetics to eat a meal or not and  what foods should be eaten). The handheld device can also  be configured to send a signal to the Swallowable device to  over-ride the actuating mechanism and so prevent, delay or  accelerate the delivery of drug. In use. Such embodiments  allow the user to intervene to prevent, delay or accelerate the  delivery of drug based upon other symptoms and/or patient  actions (e.g., eating a meal, deciding to go to sleep, exercise  etc).   The  user  may also  externally  activate  the  actuating  mechanism at a selected time period after Swallowing the  capsule. The time period can be correlated to a typical transit  time or range of transit times for food moving through the  user's GI tract to a particular location in the tract such as the  Small intestine.   Another aspect of the inventions provides therapeutic  agent preparations for delivery into the wall of the small  intestine (or other wall in the intestinal tract) using embodi  ments of the  Swallowable device  described herein.  The  preparation comprises a therapeutically effective dose of at  least one therapeutic agent. It may comprise a solid, liquid  or combination of both and can include one or more phar  maceutical excipients.  The preparation has a shape and  material consistency to be contained in embodiments of the  swallowable capsule, delivered from the capsule into the  intestinal wall and degrade within the wall to release the  dose of therapeutic agent. The preparation may also have a  selectable Surface area to  Volume ratio So as enhance or  otherwise control the rate of degradation of the preparation  in the wall of the small intestine or other body lumen. In  various embodiments, the preparation can be configured to  be coupled to an actuator Such as a release element or  actuation  mechanism which has a first  configuration  in  which the preparation is  contained in the capsule and a  second configuration in which the preparation is advanced  out of the capsule and into the wall of the small intestine.  The dose of the drug or other therapeutic agent in  the  preparation can be titrated downward from that which would  be required for conventional oral delivery methods so that  potential side effects from the drug can be reduced.   Typically, though not necessarily, the preparation will be  shaped and otherwise configured to be contained in  the  lumen of a tissue penetrating member, such as a hollow  needle which is configured to be advanced out of the capsule  and into the wall of the small intestine. The preparation itself  may comprise a tissue penetrating member configured to be  advanced into the wall of the small intestine or other lumen  in the intestinal tract.   Another aspect of the invention provides methods for the  delivery of drugs and the therapeutic agents into the walls of  the GI tract using embodiments of the swallowable drug  delivery devices. Such methods can be used for the delivery  of therapeutically effective amounts of a variety of drugs and  other therapeutic agents. These include a number of large   10   15   25   30   35   45   50   55   60   65   8  molecule peptides  and proteins  which would otherwise  require injection due to chemical breakdown in the stomach  e.g., growth hormone, parathyroid hormone, insulin, inter  ferons and other like compounds. Suitable drugs and other  therapeutic agents which can be delivered by embodiments  of invention include various chemotherapeutic agents (e.g.,  interferon), antibiotics, antivirals, insulin and related com  pounds, glucagon like peptides (e.g., GLP-1, exenatide),  parathyroid hormones, growth hormones (e.g.,  IFG and  other growth factors), anti-seizure agents, immune Suppres  sion agents and anti-parasitic agents such as various anti  malarial agents. The dosage of the particular drug can be  titrated  for the patients weight, age,  condition  or other  parameter.   In  various  method embodiments, embodiments of the  drug swallowable drug delivery  device can be used to  deliver a plurality of drugs for the treatment of multiple  conditions or for the treatment of a particular condition (e.g.,  a mixture of protease inhibitors for treatment HIV AIDS). In  use, such embodiments allow a patient to forgo the necessity  of having to take multiple  medications  for a particular  condition or conditions. Also, they provide a means for  facilitating that a regimen of two or more drugs is delivered  and absorbed into the small intestine and thus, the blood  stream at about the same time. Due to differences in chemi  cal makeup, molecular weight, etc, drugs can be absorbed  through the intestinal  wall at different rates,  resulting in  different pharmacokinetic distribution curves. Embodiments  of the invention address this issue by injecting the desired  drug mixtures at about the same time. This in turn improves  pharmacokinetics  and thus,  the efficacy  of the  selected  mixture of drugs.   Further  details  of these  and  other  embodiments and  aspects of the invention are described more fully below, with  reference to the attached drawing figures.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE  INVENTION   Embodiments of the invention provide devices, systems  and methods for delivering medications in to various loca  tions in the body. As used herein, the term \u201cmedication\u201d  refers to a medicinal preparation in any form which can  include drugs or other therapeutic agents as well as one or  more pharmaceutical excipients. Many embodiments pro  vide a swallowable device for delivering medication within  the GI tract. Particular embodiments provide a swallowable  device Such as a capsule for delivering medications to the  wall of the small intestine or other GI organ. As used herein,  \u201cGI tract\u201d refers to the esophagus, stomach, Small intestine,  large intestine and anus, while \u201cIntestinal tract\u201d refers to the  Small and large intestine. Various embodiments of the inven  tion can be configured and arranged for delivery of medi  cation into the intestinal tract as well as the entire GI tract.  Referring now to FIGS. 1-11, an embodiment of a device  10 for the delivery of medication 100 to a delivery site DS  in the intestinal tract such as the wall of the small intestine,  comprises a capsule 20 including at least one guide tube 30,  one or more tissue penetrating members 40 positioned or  otherwise advanceable in  the at  least one guide tube, a  delivery member 50, an actuating mechanism 60 and release  element 70. Medication 100, also described herein as prepa  ration 100, typically comprises at least one drug or other  therapeutic agent 101 and may include one or more phar  maceutical excipients known in the art. Collectively, one or  more of delivery member 50 and mechanism 60 may com  prise a means for delivery of medication 100 into a wall of  the  intestinal  tract.  Other delivery  means contemplated  herein include one or more expandable balloons (e.g., deliv  ery  balloon  172)  or  other  expandable  device/member  described herein.   Device 10 can be configured for the delivery of liquid,  semi-liquid or solid forms of medication 100 or all three.  Solid forms of medication/preparation 100 can include both  powder or pellet. Semi liquid forms can include a slurry or  paste. Whatever the form, preparation 100 desirably has a  shape and material consistency allowing the medication to   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   11  be advanced out of the device, into the intestinal wall (or  other luminal wall in the GI tract) and then degrade in the  intestinal wall to release the drug or other therapeutic agent  101. The material consistency can include one or more of the  hardness, porosity and Solubility of the preparation (in body  fluids). The material consistency can be achieved by one or  more of the following: i) the compaction force used to make  the preparation; ii) the use of one or more pharmaceutical  disintegrants known in the art; iii) use of other pharmaceu  tical excipients; iv) the particle size and distribution of the  preparation  (e.g.,  micronized  particles);  and  V)  use  of  micronizing and other particle formation methods known in  the art.  Suitable shapes for preparation  100 can include  cylindrical, cubical, rectangular, conical, spherical, hemi  spherical and combinations thereof. Also, the shape can be  selected so as to define a particular Surface area and Volume  of preparation 100 and thus, the ratio between the two. The  ratio  of Surface area to  Volume can in  turn, be used to  achieve a selected rate of degradation within the intestinal or  other lumen wall within the GI tract.  Larger ratios (e.g.,  larger amounts of Surface area per unit volume) can be used  to achieve faster rates of degradation and vice versa.  In  particular embodiments, the Surface area to Volume ratio can  be in the range of about 1:1 to 100:1, with specific embodi  ments of 2:1, 5:1, 20:1, 25:1, 50:1 and 75:1. Preparation/  medication 100 will typically be pre-packed within a lumen  44 of tissue  penetrating  members 40,  but can also  be  contained at another location within an interior 24 of capsule  20, or in the case of a liquid  or semi-liquid, within an  enclosed reservoir 27. The medication can be pre-shaped to  fit into the lumen or packed for example, in a powder form.  Typically, the device 10 will be configured to deliver a single  drug 101 as part of medication 100.  However in  some  embodiments, the device 10 can be configured for delivery  of multiple drugs 101 including a first second, or a third drug  which can be compounded into a single or multiple medi  cations 100. For embodiments having multiple medications/  drugs, the medications can be contained in separate tissue  penetrating members 40 or within separate compartments or  reservoirs 27 within capsule 20. In another embodiment, a  first dose 102 of medication 100 containing a first drug 101  can be packed into the penetrating member(s) 40 and a  second dose 103 of medication 100 (containing the same or  a different drug 101) can be coated onto the surface 25 of  capsule as is shown in the embodiment of FIG. 1b. The  drugs 101 in the two doses of medication 102 and 103 can  be the same or different. In this way, a bimodal pharma  cokinetic  release of the same or different drugs can be  achieved. The second dose 103 of medication 100 can have  an enteric coating 104 to ensure that it is  released in the  Small intestine and achieve a time release of the medication  100 as well. Enteric coating 104 can include one or more  enteric coatings described herein or known in the art.   A system 11 for delivery of medication 100 into the wall  of the small intestine or other location within the GI tract,  may comprise device 10, containing one or more medica  tions  100  for  the  treatment  of a  selected  condition  or  conditions. In some embodiments, the system may include a  hand held device 13, described herein for communicating  with device 10 as is shown in the embodiment of FIG. 1b.  System 11  may also be configured as a kit 14 including  system 11 and a set of instructions for use 15 which are  packaged in packaging 12 as is shown in the embodiment of  FIG. 1c. The instructions can indicate to the patient when to  take the device 10 relative to one or more events such as the  ingestion of a meal or a physiological measurement such as  blood glucose, cholesterol, etc. In Such embodiments, kit 14   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   12  can include multiple devices 10 containing a regimen of  medications 100 for a selected period of administration, e.g.,  a day, week, or multiple weeks depending upon the condi  tion to be treated.   Capsule 20 is sized to be swallowed and pass through the  intestinal tract.  The size can also be adjusted depending  upon the amount of drug to be delivered as well as the  patients weight and adult vs. pediatric applications. Capsule  20 includes an interior volume 24 and an outer surface 25  having one or more apertures 26 sized for guide tubes 30. In  addition to the other components of device 10, (e.g., the  actuation mechanism etc.) the interior Volume can include  one or more compartments or reservoirs 27. One or more  portions  of capsule  20 can  be fabricated  from  various  biocompatible polymers known in the art, including various  biodegradable polymers which in a preferred embodiment  can  comprise  PGLA (polylactic-co-glycolic  acid).  Other  suitable  biodegradable  materials  include  various  enteric  materials described herein  as well as lactide,  glycolide,  lactic  acid,  glycolic  acid,  para-dioxanone,  caprolactone,  trimethylene carbonate, caprolactone, blends and copoly  mers thereof. As is  described in  further detail herein, in  various embodiments, capsule 20 can include seams 22 of  bio-degradable material So as to controllably degrade into  Smaller pieces 23 which are more easily passed through the  intestinal tract. Additionally, in various embodiments, the  capsule can  include  various  radio-opaque  or echogenic  materials for location of the device using fluoroscopy, ultra  Sound  or  other  medical  imaging  modality.  In  specific  embodiments, all or a portion of the capsule can include  radio-opaque/echogenic markers 20m as is  shown in the  embodiment of FIGS. 1a and 1b. In use, such materials not  only allow for the location of device 10 in the GI tract, but  also allow for the determination of transit times of the device  through the GI tract.   In preferred embodiments, tissue penetrating members 40  are positioned within guide tubes 30 which serve to guide  and Support the advancement of members 40 into tissue Such  as the wall of the small intestine or other portion of the GI  tract.  The tissue  penetrating  members 40 will  typically  comprise a hollow needle or other like structure and will  have a lumen 44 and a tissue  penetrating  end 45 for  penetrating a selectable depth into the intestinal wall IW.  Member 40 may also include a pin 41 for engagement with  a  motion  converter 90 described  herein.  The depth  of  penetration can be controlled by the length of member 40,  the configuration of motion converter 90 described herein as  well as the placement of a stop or flange 40s on member 40  which  can,  in  an  embodiment,  correspond  to  pin  41  described herein. Medication 100 will typically be delivered  into tissue through lumen 44. In many embodiments, lumen  44 is pre-packed with the desired medication 100 which is  advanced out of the lumen using delivery member 50 or  other advancement means (e.g. by means of force applied to  a collapsible embodiment of member 40). As an alternative,  medication 100 can be advanced into lumen 44 from another  location/compartment in capsule 20. In some embodiments,  all or a portion of the tissue penetrating member 40 can be  fabricated from medication 100 itself.  In these and related  embodiments, the medication can have a needle or dart-like  structure (with or without barbs) configured to penetrate and  be retained in the intestinal wall, such as the wall of the  Small intestine. The dart can be sized and shaped depending  upon the medication, dose and desired depth of penetration  into the intestinal wall. Medication 100 can be formed into  darts,  pellets  or other shapes using various compression  molding methods known in the pharmaceutical arts.   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   13  In various embodiments, device 10 can include a second  42 and a third 43 tissue penetrating member 40 as is shown  in the embodiments of FIGS. 7a and 7b, with additional  numbers contemplated. Each tissue penetrating member 40  can be used to deliver the same or a different medication  100. In preferred embodiments, the tissue penetrating mem  bers  40  can  be  substantially  symmetrically  distributed  around the perimeter 21 of capsule 20 so as to anchor the  capsule onto  the  intestinal  wall  IW during  delivery  of  medications  100.  Anchoring capsule 20 in  such a  way  reduces the likelihood that the capsule will be displaced or  moved by peristaltic contractions occurring during delivery  of the medication. In specific embodiments, the amount of  anchoring force can be adjusted to the typical forces applied  during peristaltic contraction of the Small intestine. Anchor  ing can be further facilitated by configured some or all of  tissue penetrating members 40 to have a curved or arcuate  shape.   Delivery member 50 is configured to advance medication  100 through the tissue penetrating member lumen 44 and  into the intestinal wall IW. Accordingly, at least a portion of  the delivery member 50 is advanceable within the tissue  penetrating member lumen 44 and thus member 50 has a size  and shape (e.g., a piston like shape) configured to fit within  the delivery member lumen 44.   In some embodiments, the distal end 50d of the delivery  member (the end which is advanced into tissue) can have a  plunger element 51 which advances the medication within  the tissue penetrating member lumen 44 and also forms a  seal with the lumen. Plunger element 51 can be integral or  attached to delivery member 50. Preferably, delivery mem  ber 50 is  configured to travel a fixed distance within the  needle lumen 44 so as to deliver a fixed or metered dose of  drug into the intestinal wall IW. This can be achieved by one  or more of the selection of the diameter of the delivery  member (e.g.,  the diameter can be distally  tapered), the  diameter of the tissue penetrating member (which can be  narrowed at its distal end), use of a stop, and/or the actuating  mechanism. However in some embodiments, the stroke or  travel distance of member 50 can be adjusted in situ respon  sive to various factors such as one or more sensed conditions  in the GI tract. In situ adjustment can be achieved through  use of logic resource 29 (including controller 29c) coupled  to an electro-mechanical embodiment of actuating mecha  nism 60.  This allows for a variable dose of medication  and/or variation of the distance the medication is injected  into the intestinal wall.   Actuating mechanism 60 can be coupled to at least one of  the tissue penetrating member 40 or delivery member 50.  The actuating mechanism is configured to advance tissue  penetrating member 40 a selectable distance into the intes  tinal wall IW as well as advance the delivery member to  deliver medication 100 and then withdraw the tissue pen  etrating member from the intestinal wall. In various embodi  ments,  actuating  mechanism  60  can  comprise a spring  loaded mechanism which is configured to be released by  release element 70. Suitable springs 80 can include both coil  (including conical shaped springs) and leaf springs with  other  spring  structures  also  contemplated.  In  particular  embodiments, spring 80 can be substantially cone-shaped to  reduce the length of the spring in the compressed State even  to the point where the compressed length of the spring is  about the thickness of several coils (e.g., two or three) or  only one coil.   In particular embodiments actuating mechanism 60 can  comprise a spring 80, a first motion converter 90, and a  second motion converter 94 and a track member 98 as is   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   14  shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 2, 4 and 8a-8c. The  release element 70 is coupled to  spring 80 to  retain the  spring in a compressed state Such that degradation of the  release  element releases  the  spring.  Spring 80 may be  coupled to release element 70 by a latch or other connecting  element 81.  First  motion converter 90 is  configured to  convert motion of spring 80 to advance and withdraw the  tissue penetrating member 40 in and out of the intestinal wall  or other tissue. The second motion converter 94 is config  ured to convert motion of the spring 80 to advance the  delivery  member 50 into  the tissue penetrating  member  lumen 44. Motion converters 90 and 94 are pushed by the  spring and ride along a rod or other track member 98 which  fits into a track member lumen 99 of converter 90. The track  member 98 serves to guide the path of the converters 90.  Converters 90 and 94 engage the tissue penetrating member  40 and/or delivery  member 50 (directly or indirectly) to  produce the desired motion. They have a shape and other  characteristics configured to convert motion of the spring 80  along its  longitudinal axis into orthogonal motion of the  tissue penetrating member 40 and/or delivery member 50  though conversion in other directions is also contemplated.  The motion converters can have a wedge, trapezoidal or  curved shape with other shapes also contemplated. In par  ticular embodiments, the first motion converter 90 can have  a trapezoidal shape 90t and include a slot 93 which engages  a pin 41 on the tissue penetrating member that rides in the  slot as is shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 2, 3 and 4. Slot  93 can also have a trapezoidal shape 93t that mirrors or  otherwise corresponds to the overall shape of converter 90.  Slot 93 serves to push the tissue penetrating member 40  during the upslope portion 91 of the trapezoid and then pull  it back during the down slope portion 92. In one variation,  one or both of the motion converters 90 and 94 can comprise  a cam or cam like device (not shown). The cam can be  turned by spring 80 so as to engage the tissue penetrating  and/or delivery members 40 and 50. One or more compo  nents of mechanism 60 (as well as other components of  device 10) including motion converters 90 and 94 can be  fabricated using various MEMS-based methods known in  the art so as to allow for selected amounts of miniaturization  to fit within capsule 10. Also as is described herein, they can  be formed from various biodegradable materials known in  the art.   In other variations, the actuating mechanism 60 can also  comprise an electro-mechanical device/mechanism such as a  Solenoid or a piezoelectric device. In one embodiment, a  piezoelectric device used in mechanism 60 can comprise a  shaped piezoelectric element which has a non-deployed and  deployed State. This element can be configured to go into the  deployed State upon the application of a Voltage and then  return to the non-deployed state upon the removal of the  Voltage or other change in the Voltage. This and related  embodiments allow for a reciprocating motion of the actu  ating mechanism 60 so as to both advance the tissue pen  etrating member and then withdraw it. The voltage for the  piezoelectric element can be obtained generated using a  battery or a piezoelectric based energy converter which  generates Voltage by mechanical deformation Such as that  which occurs from compression of the capsule 20 by a  peristaltic  contraction  of the  Small intestine around the  capsule. Further description of piezoelectric based energy  converters  is  found in  U.S. patent application  Ser.  No.  12/556,524 which is fully incorporated by reference herein  for all purposes. In one embodiment, deployment of tissue  penetrating members 40 can in fact be triggered from a   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   15  peristaltic contraction of the small intestine which provides  the mechanical energy for generating Voltage for the piezo  electric element.   Release element 70  will  typically  be coupled to  the  actuating mechanism 60 and/or a spring coupled to the  actuating mechanism; however, other configurations are also  contemplated. In preferred embodiments, release element 70  is coupled to a spring 80 positioned within capsule 20 So as  to retain the spring in a compressed State 85 as shown in the  embodiment of FIG. 2. Degradation of the release element  70 releases spring 80 to actuate actuation mechanism 60.  Accordingly, release element 70 can thus function as an  actuator 70a (actuator 70 may also include spring 80 and  other elements of mechanism 60). As is explained further  below, release element 70/actuator 70a has a first configu  ration where the therapeutic agent preparation 100 is con  tained within capsule 20 and a second configuration where  the therapeutic  agent preparation  is  advanced from  the  capsule into the wall of the small intestine or other luminal  wall in the intestinal tract.   In many embodiments, release element 70 comprises a  material configured to degrade upon exposure to chemical  conditions  in  the  Small  or large  intestine  such  as  pH.  Typically, release element 70 is configured to degrade upon  exposure to a selected pH in the Small intestine, e.g., 7.0. 7.1,  7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.68.0 or greater. The release element can  also be configured to degrade within a particular range of pH  such as, e.g., 7.0 to 7.5. In particular embodiments, the pH  at which release element 70 degrades (defined herein as the  degradation pH) can be selected for the particular drug to be  delivered so as to release the drug at a location in Small  intestine which corresponds to the selected pH. Further, for  embodiments of device 10 having multiple medications 100,  the device can include a first release element 70 (coupled to  an actuating mechanism for delivering a first drug) config  ured to degrade at first pH and a second release element 70  (coupled to an actuating mechanism for delivering a second  drug) configured to degrade at a second pH (with additional  numbers of release elements contemplated for varying num  ber of drugs).   Release element 70 can also be configured to degrade in  response to other conditions in the Small intestine (or other  GI location). In particular embodiments, the release element  70 can be configured to degrade in response to particular  chemical conditions in the fluids in the small intestine such  as those which occur after ingestion of a meal (e.g., a meal  containing fats, starches or proteins). In this way, the release  of medication  100 can be substantially  synchronized or  otherwise timed with the digestion of a meal.   Various approaches are contemplated for biodegradation  of release element 70. In particular embodiments, biodeg  radation of release element 70 from one or more conditions  in the small intestine (or other location in the GI tract) can  be achieved by one or more of the following approaches: i)  selection of the materials for the release element, ii)  the  amount of cross linking of those materials;  and iii)  the  thickness  and other  dimensions  of the  release  element.  Lesser amounts of cross linking and or thinner dimensions  can increase the rate of degradation and visa Versa. Suitable  materials for the release element can comprise biodegrad  able materials such as various enteric materials which are  configured to degrade upon exposure to the higher pH in the  intestines.  Suitable enteric  materials include, but are not  limited to, the following: cellulose acetate phthalate, cellu  lose  acetate  trimellitate,  hydroxypropyl  methylcellulose  phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, carboxymethylethyl  cellulose, co-polymerized methacrylic acid/methacrylic acid   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   16  methyl esters as well as other enteric materials known in the  art. The selected enteric materials can be copolymerized or  otherwise combined with one or more other polymers to  obtain a number of other particular material properties in  addition  to  biodegradation.  Such properties  can  include  without limitation stiffness, strength, flexibility and hard  CSS.  In alternative embodiments, the release element 70 can  comprise a film or plug 70p that fits over or otherwise blocks  guide tubes 30 and retains the tissue penetrating member 40  inside the guide tube.  In these and related embodiments,  tissue penetrating member 40 is coupled to a spring loaded  actuating mechanism Such that when the release element is  degraded sufficiently, it releases the tissue penetrating mem  ber which then springs out of the guide tube to penetrate into  the intestinal wall. In still other embodiments, release ele  ment 70 can be shaped to function as a latch which holds the  tissue penetrating member 40 in place. In these and related  embodiments, the release element can be located on the  exterior or the interior of capsule 20.  In  the latter case,  capsule 20 and/or guide tubes 30 can be configured to allow  for the ingress of intestinal fluids into the capsule interior to  allow for the degradation of the release element.   In some embodiments, actuating mechanism 60 can be  actuated by means of a sensor 67, such as a pH sensor 68 or  other chemical sensor which detects the presence of the  capsule in the small intestine. Sensor 67 can then send a  signal to actuating mechanism 60 or to an electronic con  troller 29c coupled to actuating mechanism 60 to actuate the  mechanism. Embodiments of a pH sensor 68 can comprise  an electrode-based sensor or it can be a mechanically-based  sensor such as a polymer which shrinks or expands upon  exposure to a selected pH or other chemical conditions in the  Small intestine.  In  related embodiments, an expandable/  contractible  sensor  67 can  also  comprise the  actuating  mechanism 60 itself by using the mechanical motion from  the expansion or contraction of the sensor.   According to another embodiment for detecting that the  device in the small intestine (or other location in the GI  tract), sensor 67 can comprise pressure/force sensor Such as  strain gauge for detecting the number of peristaltic contrac  tions that capsule 20 is being Subject to within a particular  location in the intestinal tract (in Such embodiments capsule  20 is desirably sized to be gripped by the small intestine  during a peristaltic contraction). Different locations within  the GI tract have different number of peristaltic contractions.  The small intestine has between 12 to 9 contractions per  minute with the frequency decreasing down the length of the  intestine.  Thus, according to one or more embodiments,  detection of the number of peristaltic contractions can be  used to not only determine if capsule 20 is  in the small  intestine, but the relative location within the intestine as  well. In use, these and related embodiments allow for release  of medication  100 at a particular location  in  the  small  intestine.   As an alternative or Supplement to internally activated  drug delivery (e.g., using a release element and/or sensor),  in Some embodiments, the user may externally activate the  actuating mechanism 60 to deliver medication 100 by means  of RF, magnetic or other wireless signaling means known in  the art. In these and related embodiments, the user can use  a handheld communication device 13 (e.g., a hand held RF  device Such as a cell phone) as is shown in the embodiment  of FIG. 1b, to send a receive signals 17 from device 10. In  Such embodiments, Swallowable device may include a trans  mitter 28 such as an  RF transceiver chip or other like  communication device/circuitry. Handheld device 13 may   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   17  not only  includes  signaling  means, but also  means for  informing the user when device 10 is in the small intestine  or other location in the GI tract. The later embodiment can  be implemented through the use of logic resources 29 (e.g.,  a processor 29) coupled to transmitter 28 to signal to detect  and singe to the user when the device is in the Small intestine  or other location  (e.g.,  by signaling an input  from  the  sensor). Logic resources 29 may include a controller 29c  (either in  hardware or software) to control one or more  aspects of the process. The same handheld device can also  be configured to alert the user when actuating mechanism 60  has been activated and the selected medication 100 delivered  (e.g., using processor 29 and transmitter 28). In this way, the  user is provided confirmation that medication 100 has been  delivered. This allows the user to take other appropriate  drugs/therapeutic  agents  as  well as  make other  related  decisions (e.g., for diabetics to eat a meal or not and what  foods should be eaten). The handheld device can also be  configured to send a signal to swallowable device 10 to  over-ride actuating mechanism 60 and so prevent delay or  accelerate the delivery of medication  100.  In  use,  such  embodiments allow the user to intervene to prevent, delay or  accelerate the delivery  of medication, based upon other  symptoms and/or patient actions (e.g., eating a meal, decid  ing to go to sleep, exercise etc). The user may also externally  activate actuating mechanism 60 at a selected time period  after Swallowing the capsule. The time period can be cor  related to a typical transit time or range of transit times for  food moving through the user's GI tract to  a particular  location in the tract Such as the Small intestine.   In particular embodiments, the capsule 20 can include  seams 22 of biodegradable  material  which controllably  degrade to break the capsule into capsule pieces 23 of a  selectable size and shape to facilitate passage through the GI  tract as is shown in the embodiment of FIGS. 10a and 10b.  Seams 22 can also include pores or other openings 22p for  ingress of fluids into the seam to accelerate biodegradation  as is shown in the embodiment of FIG. 10. Other means for  accelerating biodegradation of seams 22 can include pre  stressing the seam and/or including perforations 22f in the  seam as is also shown in the embodiment of FIG. 10. In still  other embodiments, seam 22 can be constructed of materials  and/or have a structure which is readily degraded by absorp  tion of ultrasound energy, e.g. high frequency ultrasound  (HIFU), allowing the capsule to be degraded into smaller  pieces using externally or endoscopically (or other mini  mally invasive method) administered ultrasound.   Suitable materials for seams 22 can include one or more  biodegradable materials described herein such as PGLA,  glycolic acid etc. Seams 22 can be attached to capsule body  20 using various joining methods known in the polymer arts  Such as molding, hot melt junctions, etc. Additionally for  embodiments of capsule 20 which are also fabricated from  biodegradable materials, faster biodegradation of seam 22  can  be achieved by one or more of the  following:  i)  fabricating the seam from a faster biodegrading material. ii)  pre-stressing the seam, or iii)  perforating the seam. The  concept of using biodegradable seams 22 to produce con  trolled degradation of a swallowable device in the GI tract  can also be applied to other swallowable devices such as  Swallowable cameras (or other Swallowable imaging device)  to facilitate passage through the GI tract and reduce the  likelihood of such a device becoming stuck in the GI tract.  Accordingly, embodiments of biodegradable seam 22 can be  adapted for Swallowable imaging and other Swallowable  devices.   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   18  Another aspect of the invention provides methods for the  delivery of drugs and other therapeutic agents (in the form  of medication 100) into the walls of the GI tract using one  or more embodiments of swallowable drug delivery device  10. An exemplary embodiment of such a method will now  be described. The described embodiment of drug delivery  occurs in  the small intestine  SI.  However, it  should be  appreciated that this is exemplary and that embodiments of  the invention can be used for delivering drug in a number of  locations in the GI tract including the stomach and the large  intestine.  For ease  of discussion,  the Swallowable drug  delivery device 10 will sometimes be referred to herein as a  capsule.  As described  above,  in  various  embodiments,  device  10  may be packaged as  a  kit  11  within  sealed  packaging 12 that includes device 10 and a set of instruc  tions for use 15. If the patient is using a handheld device 13,  the patient may instructed to enter data into device 13 either  manually or via a bar code 18 (or other identifying indicia  18) located on the instructions 15 or packaging 12. If a bar  code is used, the patient would scan the bar code using a bar  code reader 19 on device 13. After opening packaging 12.  reading the instructions 15 and entering any required data,  the patient swallows an embodiment of the swallowable  drug delivery  device 10.  Depending upon the drug, the  patient may take the device 10 in conjunction with a meal  (before, during or after) or a physiological measurement.  Capsule 20 is sized to pass through the GI tract and travels  through the patient\u2019s stomach S and into the Small intestine  SI through peristaltic action as is shown in the embodiment  of FIG. 11. Once in the small intestine, the release element  70 is degraded by the basic pH in the small intestine (or other  chemical or physical condition unique to the small intestine)  So as to actuate the actuating mechanism 60 and deliver  medication  100 into  the  wall  of the  small  intestine  SI  according to one or more embodiments of the invention. For  embodiments including a hollow needle or other hollow  tissue penetrating member 40, medication delivery is effec  tuated by using the actuating mechanism 60 to advance the  needle 40 a selected distance into the mucosa of the intes  tinal wall IS, and then the medication is injected through the  needle lumen 40 by advancement of the delivery member  50. The delivery member 50 is withdrawn and the needle 40  is then withdrawn back within the body of the capsule (e.g.  by recoil of the spring) detaching from the intestinal wall.  For embodiments of device 10 having multiple needles, a  second or third needle 42, 43 can also be used to deliver  additional doses of the same drug or separate drugs 101.  Needle advancement can be done substantially simultane  ously or in sequence. In preferred embodiments that use  multiple needles, needle advancement can be done substan  tially simultaneously so as to anchor device 10 in the small  intestine during drug delivery.   After medication delivery, device 10 then passes through  the intestinal tract including the large intestine LI and is  ultimately excreted.  For embodiments of the capsule 20  having biodegradable seams 22 or other biodegradable por  tions, the capsule is  degraded in the intestinal tract into  Smaller pieces to facilitate passage through and excretion  from the intestinal tract as is shown in the embodiments of  FIGS. 9a and 9b. In particular embodiments having biode  gradable tissue penetrating needles/members 40, should the  needle get stuck in the intestinal wall, the needle biode  grades releasing the capsule 20 from the wall.   For embodiments of device 10 including a sensor 67.  actuation of mechanism 60 can be effectuated by the sensor  sending a signal to actuating mechanism 60 and/or a pro  cessor 29/controller 29c coupled to the actuating mecha   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   19  nism. For embodiments of device 10 including external  actuation capability, the user may externally activate actu  ating mechanism 60 at a selected time period after Swal  lowing the capsule. The time period can be correlated to a  typical transit time or range of transit times for food moving  through the user's GI tract to a particular location in the tract  Such as the Small intestine.   One or more embodiments of the above methods can be  used for the delivery of preparations 100 containing thera  peutically effective amounts of a variety of drugs and other  therapeutic agents 101 to treat a variety of diseases and  conditions. These include a number of large molecule pep  tides and proteins which would otherwise require injection  due to chemical breakdown in the stomach. The dosage of  the particular drug can be titrated for the patients weight,  age or other parameter. Also the dose o drug 101 to achieve  a desired or therapeutic effect (e.g., insulin for blood glucose  regulation) when delivered by one or more embodiments of  the invention can be less than the amount required should the  drug have been delivered by conventional oral delivery (e.g.,  a swallowable pill  that  is  digested in  the stomach and  absorbed through the wall of the small intestine). This is due  to the fact that there is no degradation of the drug by acid and  other digestive fluids in the stomach and the fact that all, as  opposed to only a portion of the drug is delivered into the  wall of the small intestine (or other lumen in the intestinal  tract, e.g., large intestine, stomach, etc.). Depending upon  the drug 101, the dose 102 delivered in preparation 100 can  be in the range from 100 to 5% of a dose delivered by  conventional oral delivery (e.g., a pill) to achieve a desired  therapeutic effect (e.g.,  blood glucose regulation, seizure  regulation, etc.) with even lower amounts contemplated. The  particular dose reduction can be titrated based upon the  particular drug, the condition to be treated, and the patients  weight, age and condition.  For some drugs (with known  levels of degradation in the intestinal tract) a standard dose  reduction  can  be employed (e.g.,  10 to  20%).  Larger  amounts of dose reduction can be used for drugs which are  more prone to degradation and poor absorption. In this way,  the potential toxicity and other side effects  (e.g.,  gastric  cramping, irritable bowel, hemorrhage, etc.) of a particular  drug or drugs delivered by device 10 can be reduced because  the ingested dose is lowered. This in turn, improves patient  compliance because the patient has reduction both in the  severity and incidence of side effects. Additional benefits of  embodiments employing dose reduction of drug 101 include  a reduced likelihood for the patient to develop a tolerance to  the drug (requiring higher doses) and, in the case of antibi  otics, for the patient to develop resistant strains of bacteria.  Also, other levels of dose reduction can be achieved for  patients  undergoing gastric  bypass  operations  and other  procedures in which sections of the small intestine have  been removed or its working (e.g., digestive) length effec  tively shortened.   In addition to delivery of a single drug, embodiments of  swallowable drug delivery device 10 and methods of their  use can be used to  deliver a plurality  of drugs for the  treatment of multiple conditions or for the treatment of a  particular condition (e.g., protease inhibitors for treatment  HIV AIDS). In use, such embodiments allow a patient to  forgo the necessity of having to take multiple medications  for a particular condition or conditions. Also, they provide a  means for facilitating that a regimen of two or more drugs  is delivered and absorbed into the small intestine and thus,  the blood stream, at about the same time. Due to difference  in chemical makeup, molecular weight, etc., drugs can be  absorbed through the intestinal wall at different rates, result   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   20  ing  in  different  pharmacokinetic  distribution  curves.  Embodiments of the invention address this issue by injecting  the desired drug mixtures at Substantially the same time.  This in turn, improves the pharmacokinetics and thus the  efficacy  of the  selected  mixture of drugs.  Additionally,  eliminating the need to take multiple drugs is particularly  beneficial  to patients  who have one or more long term  chronic conditions including those who have impaired cog  nitive or physical abilities.   In various applications, embodiments of the above meth  ods can be used to deliver preparations 100 including drugs  and therapeutic agents 101 to provide treatment for a num  ber of medical conditions and diseases. The medical condi  tions and diseases which can be treated with embodiments of  the invention can include without limitation: cancer, hor  monal conditions (e.g., hypothyperthyroid, growth hormone  conditions), osteoporosis, high blood pressure, elevated cho  lesterol and triglyceride, diabetes and other glucose regula  tion disorders, infection (local or septicemia), epilepsy and  other seizure disorders, osteoporosis, coronary arrhythmia\u2019s  (both atrial and ventricular), coronary ischemia anemia or  other like condition. Still other conditions and diseases are  also contemplated.   In many embodiments, the treatment of the particular  disease or condition can be performed without the need for  injecting  the  drug  or  other  therapeutic  agent  (or  other  non-oral form of delivery such as Suppositories) but instead,  relying solely on the therapeutic agent(s) that is delivered  into the wall of the small intestine or other portion of the GI  tract. Similarly, the patient need not take conventional oral  forms of a drug or other therapeutic agent, but again rely  solely on delivery into the wall of the small intestine using  embodiments of the swallowable capsule. In other embodi  ments, the therapeutic agent(s) delivered into the wall of the  Small intestine  can be delivered in  conjunction with an  injected dose of the agent(s). For example, the patient may  take a daily dose of therapeutic agent using the embodiments  of the Swallowable capsule, but only need take an injected  dose every several days or when the patient\u2019s condition  requires  it  (e.g.,  hyperglycemia).  The same is  true  for  therapeutic agents that are traditionally  delivered in  oral  form (e.g., the patient can take the Swallowable capsule and  take the conventional oral form of the agent as needed). The  dosages delivered in Such embodiments (e.g., the Swallowed  and injected dose) can be titrated as needed (e.g.,  using  standard dose response curve and other pharmacokinetic  methods can be used to determine the appropriate dosages).  Also, for embodiments using therapeutic agents that can be  delivered by conventional oral means, the dose delivered  using embodiments of the  Swallowable capsule can be  titrated below the dosage normally given for oral delivery of  the agent since there is little or no degradation of the agent  within the stomach or other portion of the intestinal tract  (herein again standard dose response curve and other phar  macokinetic methods can be applied).   Various groups of embodiments of preparation 100 con  taining one or more drugs or other therapeutic agents 101 for  the treatment of various diseases and conditions will now be  described with references to dosages. It should be appreci  ated that these embodiments, including the particular thera  peutic agents and the respective dosages are exemplary and  the preparation 100 can comprise a number of other thera  peutic agents described herein (as well as those known in the  art) that are configured for delivery into a luminal wall in the  intestinal tract (e.g., the Small intestinal wall) using various  embodiments of device 10. The dosages can be larger or  Smaller than those described and can be adjusted using one   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   21  or more methods described herein or known in the art. In one  group of embodiments, therapeutic agent preparation 100  can comprise a therapeutically effective dose of insulin for  the treatment of diabetes and other glucose regulation dis  orders. The insulin can be human or synthetically derived as  is known in the art. In one embodiment, preparation 100 can  contain a therapeutically effective amount of insulin in the  range of about 1-10 units (one unit being the biological  equivalent of about 45.5ug of pure crystalline insulin), with  particular ranges of 2-4, 3-9, 4-9, 5-8 or 6-7. The amount of  insulin in the preparation can be titrated based upon one or  more of the following  factors  (herein,  \u201cglucose control  titration factors): i) the patient's condition (e.g., type 1  vs.  type II  diabetes; ii)  the patients previous overall level of  glycemic control; iii) the patients weight; iv) the patients  age; v) the frequency of dosage (e.g., once Vs. multiple times  a day); vi) time of day (e.g.,  morning VS.  evening); vii)  particular meal (breakfast VS. dinner); vii) content/glycemic  index of a particular meal (e.g., high fat/lipid and Sugar  content (e.g., foods causing a rapid rise in blood Sugar) vs.  low fat and Sugar content; and viii) content of the patients  overall diet (e.g., amount of Sugars and other carbohydrates,  lipids and protein consumed daily).   In  another  group  of embodiments,  therapeutic  agent  preparation  100 can comprise a therapeutically effective  dose of one or more incretins for the treatment of diabetes  and other glucose regulation disorders. Such incretins can  include Glucacon like peptides 1  (GLP-1) and their ana  logues, and Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). Suitable GLP-1  analogues  include  exenatide,  liraglutide,  albiglutide  and  taspoglutide as well as their analogues, derivatives and other  functional equivalents. In one embodiment preparation 100  can contain a therapeutically effective amount of exenatide  in the range of about 1-10 ug, with particular ranges of 2-4,  4-6, 4-8 and 8-10 ug respectively. In another embodiment,  preparation  100 can  contain  a  therapeutically  effective  amount of liraglutide in the range of about 1-2 mg (milli  grams), with particular ranges of 1.0 to 1.4, 1.2 to 1.6 and 1.2  to 1.8 mg respectively. One or more of the glucose control  titration factors can be applied to titrate the dose ranges for  exenatide, liraglutide or other GLP-1 analogue or incretin.  In yet another group of embodiments, therapeutic agent  preparation 100 can comprise a combination of therapeutic  agents  for the  treatment  of diabetes  and other glucose  regulation disorders. Embodiments of Such a combination  can include therapeutically effective doses of incretin and  biguanide compounds. The incretin can comprise one or  more GLP-1 analogues described herein, such as exenatide  and the biguanide can comprise metformin (e.g., that avail  able under the Trademark of GLUCOPHAGE(R) manufac  tured by Merck Sante\u0301 S.A.S.) and its analogue, derivatives  and other functional equivalents. In one embodiment, prepa  ration 100 can comprise a combination of a therapeutically  effective amount of exenatide in the range of about 1-10 ug  and a therapeutically effective amount of metformin in a  range of about 1 to 3 grams. Smaller and larger ranges are  also contemplated with one or more of the glucose control  titration  factors  used  to  titrate  the  respective  dose  of  exenatide (or other incretin) and metformin or other bigu  anide. Additionally, the dosages of the exenatide or other  incretin and metforminor other biguanide can be matched to  improved level  of glucose control  for the patient (e.g.,  maintenance of blood glucose within normal physiological  levels and/or a reduction in the incidence and severity of  instances  of  hyperglycemia  and/or  hypoglycemia)  for  extended periods of time ranges from hours (e.g.,  12) to a  day to multiple days, with still longer periods contemplated.   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   22  Matching of dosages can also be achieved by use of the  glucose control regulation factors as well as monitoring of  the  patient\u2019s  blood glucose  for  extended periods  using  glycosylated  hemoglobin  (known  as  hemoglobin  Alc,  HbA1c, A1C, or Hb1c) and other analytes and measure  ments correlative to long term average blood glucose levels.  Drug delivery compositions and components of known  drug delivery systems may be employed and/or modified for  use  in  some embodiments  of the  inventions  described  herein. For example, micro-needles and other microstruc  tures used for delivery of drugs through the skin surface with  drug patches  may be modified and included within the  capsules described herein and used to instead deliver a drug  preparation into a lumen wall of the gastrointestinal tract  such as the wall of the small intestine. Suitable polymer  micro-needle  structures  may be commercially  available  from Corium of California, such as the MicroCorTM micro  delivery  system  technology.  Other  components  of the  MicroCorTM patch delivery systems, including drug formu  lations or components, may also be incorporated into the  capsules described herein. Alternatively, a variety of pro  viders are commercially available to  formulate combina  tions  of polymers or other  drug-delivery  matrices  with  selected drugs and other drug preparation components so as  to produce desired shapes (such as the releasable tissue  penetrating shapes described herein) having desirable drug  release characteristics.  Such providers may, for example,  include Corium, SurModics of Minnesota, BioSensors Inter  national of Singapore, or the like.   One advantage and feature of various embodiments of the  therapeutic compositions described herein is that the bio  logic (therapeutic peptide or protein) drug payload is pro  tected from degradation and hydrolysis by the action of  peptidases and proteases in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  These enzymes are ubiquitous throughout living systems.  The GI tract is especially rich in proteases whose function is  to break down the complex proteins and peptides in one\u2019s  diet into Smaller segments and release amino acids which are  then  absorbed  from  the  intestine.  The  compositions  described herein are designed to protect the therapeutic  peptide or protein from the actions of these GI proteases and  to deliver the peptide or protein payload directly into the  wall of the intestine.  There are  two features  in  various  embodiments of the compositions described herein which  serve to protect the protein or peptide payload from the  actions of GI proteases. First, in certain embodiments, the  capsule shell, which contains the deployment engine and  machinery, does not dissolve until it reaches the duodenal  and Sub-duodenal intestinal  segments, owing to  the pH  sensitive coating on the outer Surface of the capsule which  prevents  its  dissolution  in  the low pH of the  stomach.  Second, in certain embodiments, hollow maltose (or other  appropriate polymer) micro-spears contain the actual thera  peutic peptide or protein; the maltose (or other polymer)  micro-spears are designed to penetrate the intestine muscle  as soon as the outer capsule shell dissolves; and the micro  spears themselves slowly dissolve in the intestinal muscle  wall to release the drug payload. Thus, the peptide or protein  payload is not exposed to the actions of the GI proteases and  therefore does not undergo degradation via proteolysis in the  GI tract. This feature, in  turn, contributes to the high '%  bioavailability of the therapeutic peptide or protein.   Embodiments described herein include therapeutic com  positions comprising liraglutide for the treatment of diabetes  or other glucose regulation disorders.  Such compositions  result in the delivery of liraglutide with desirable pharma  cokinetic properties. In this regard, pharmacokinetic metrics   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   10   15   23  of note include C, the peak plasma concentration of a  drug after administration, t, the time to reach C; and  t, the time required for the plasma concentration of the  drug to reach half its C  value after having reached C.  These metrics can be measured using standard pharmacoki  netic  measurement techniques known in  the art.  In  one  approach plasma samples may be taken at set time intervals  (e.g.,  one minute,  five  minutes,  /2  hour,  1  hour,  etc.)  beginning and then after administration of the drug or other  therapeutic agent either by use of a swallowable device or by  non-vascular injection. The concentration of the drug in  plasma can then be measured using one or more appropriate  analytical methods such as GC-Mass Spec, LC-Mass Spec,  HPLC or various ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assays) which can be adapted for the particular drug. A  concentration vs. time curve (also herein referred to as a  concentration  profile)  can then  be developed using  the  measurements from the plasma samples. The peak of the  concentration curve corresponds to C  and the time at  which this occurs corresponds to t. The time in the curve  where the concentration reaches half its  maximum value  (i.e., C.) after having reached C. corresponds to ta this  value is also known as the elimination half-life of the drug.  The start time for determination of C  can be based on the  time at which the injection is made for the case on non  vascular injection and the point in time at which embodi  ments of the Swallowable device advances one or more  tissue penetrating members (containing the drug) into the  Small intestine or other location in the GI tract (e.g., the large  intestine). In the later case, this time can determined using  one or means including a remote controlled embodiment of  the swallowable device which deploys the tissue penetrating  members into the intestine wall in response to an external  control signal (e.g., an RF signal) or for an embodiment of  the Swallowable device which sends an RF or other signal  detectable outside the body when the tissue penetrating  members have been deployed. Other means for detection of  tissue penetrating member deployment into the Small intes  tine are contemplated Such as one more medical imaging  modalities including for example, ultrasound or fluoroscopy.  In any one of these studies, appropriate animal models can  be used for example, dog, pig, rat etc. in order to model the  human pharmacokinetic response.   Thus, various embodiments provide a therapeutic com  position (also referred to herein as a preparation) comprising  liraglutide. The composition is adapted for insertion into an  intestinal wall after oral ingestion, wherein upon insertion,  the composition releases liraglutide into the bloodstream  from the intestinal wall to achieve a C  faster than an  extravascularly injected dose of the therapeutic agent that is  to say, achieving a C  for the inserted form of therapeutic  agent in a shorter time period (e.g., a smallert) than that  for a dose of liraglutide that is injected extravascularly Note,  that the dose of therapeutic agent in the composition deliv  ered into  the  intestinal  wall and the  dose delivered by  extravascular injection, may, but need not, be comparable to  achieve these results. In various embodiments, the compo  sition is configured to achieve at  for liraglutide (e.g., by  release of the liraglutide into  the bloodstream from the  intestinal wall, e.g.,  that of the Small intestine) which is  about 80%, or 50%, or 30%, or 20%, or 10% of at  for an  extravascularly  injected dose of the liraglutide.  Such an  extravascularly  injected  dose of liraglutide  can  be,  for  example, a Subcutaneous injection oran intramuscular injec  tion. In certain embodiments, the Cattained by delivering  the liraglutide by insertion into the intestinal wall is  sub  stantially greater, such as 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   24  even a 100 times greater, than the C  attained when the  liraglutide  is  delivered  orally  without insertion  into  the  intestinal wall for example by a pill other convention oral  form of the therapeutic agent or related compound. In some  embodiments, the  therapeutic  liraglutide  composition  is  configured to produce a long-term release of liraglutide.  Also, the  composition  can  be configured to  produce a  long-term release of liraglutide with a selectable t. For  example, the selectable t  may be 6, or 9, or 12, or 15 or  18, or 24 hours.   In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent composition  may also  include a therapeutically  effective  dose of an  incretin for the treatment of diabetes or a glucose regulation  disorder. Incretins which can be used include a glucagon  like  peptide-1  (GLP-1), a GLP-1 analogue or a gastric  inhibitory  peptide  (GIP).  Exemplary  GLP-1  analogues  include exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide and taspoglutide.  Any appropriate  dose of an  incretin  may be used;  for  example, exenatide may be used in a dose ranging from  about 1  to 10 micrograms; or liraglutide may be used in a  range from about 1 to 2 mg.   Various embodiments also provide a liraglutide compo  sition adapted for insertion into an intestinal wall after oral  ingestion, wherein upon insertion, the composition releases  the liraglutde into the blood stream from the intestinal wall  to achieve a t  that is  greater than a to for an orally  ingested dose of the liraglutide that is not inserted into the  intestinal wall. For example, the t  of the dose inserted into  the intestinal wall may be 100 or 50 or 10 or 5 times greater  than the dose that is not inserted into the intestinal wall.   The liraglutide may be in solid form, such as a solid form  composition configured to degrade in the intestinal wall, and  the Solid form composition may have, for example, a tissue  penetrating feature Such as a pointed tip. The therapeutic  composition may comprise at least one biodegradable mate  rial and/or may comprise at least one pharmaceutical excipi  ent, including a biodegradable polymer Such as PGLA or a  Sugar Such as maltose.   The therapeutic liraglutide composition may be adapted to  be orally  delivered in  a Swallowable capsule.  In certain  embodiments such a Swallowable capsule may be adapted to  be operably coupled to a mechanism having a first configu  ration and a second configuration, the liraglutide composi  tion being contained within the capsule in the first configu  ration and advanced out of the capsule and into the intestinal  wall in the second configuration. Such an operably coupled  mechanism may comprise at least one of an expandable  member, an expandable balloon, a valve, a tissue penetrating  member, a valve coupled to an expandable balloon, or a  tissue penetrating member coupled to an expandable bal  loon.   In some embodiments, the liraglutide composition may be  configured  to  be delivered  within  a  lumen of a  tissue  penetrating member and/or the liraglutide composition may  be shaped as a tissue penetrating member advanceable into  the intestinal wall. The tissue penetrating member may be  sized to be completely contained within the intestinal wall,  and/or it may include a tissue penetrating feature for pen  etrating the intestinal wall, and/or it may include a retaining  feature for retaining the tissue penetrating member within  the intestinal wall. The retaining feature may comprise, for  example, a barb. In some embodiments, the tissue penetrat  ing member is configured to be advanced into the intestinal  wall by the application of a force to a surface of the tissue  penetrating member and, optionally, the tissue penetrating  member has sufficient stiffness to be advanced completely  into the intestinal wall and/or the surface of the penetrating   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   25  member is  configured to  be operatively  coupled to  an  expandable balloon which applies the force upon expansion  and/or the tissue penetrating member is configured to detach  from a structure applying the force when a direction of the  force changes.   Various  aspects  of the  invention  also  provide  other  embodiments of a  Swallowable delivery  device for  the  delivery of medication 100 in addition to those described  above. According to one or more such embodiments, the  Swallow delivery device can include one or more expand  able balloons or other expandable devices for use in deliv  ering one or more tissue penetrating members including  medication 100 into the wall of an intestine, such as the  small  intestine.  Referring  now to  FIGS.  12-20,  another  embodiment of a device 110 for the delivery of medication  100 to a delivery site DS in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract,  can comprise a capsule 120 sized to be Swallowed and pass  through the intestinal tract, a deployment member 130, one  or more tissue penetrating members 140 containing medi  cation 100, a deployable aligner 160 and a delivery mecha  nism 170.  In  some embodiments,  medication  100 (also  referred to herein as preparation 100) may itself comprise  tissue penetrating member 140. The deployable aligner 160  is positioned within the capsule and configured to align the  capsule with the intestine Such as the Small intestine. Typi  cally,  this  will entail aligning a longitudinal axis of the  capsule with a longitudinal axis of the intestine; however,  other  alignments  are  also  contemplated.  The  delivery  mechanism 170 is configured for delivering medication 100  into the intestinal wall and will typically include a delivery  member 172 such as an expandable member. The deploy  ment member 130 is configured for deploying at least one of  the aligner 160 or the delivery mechanism 170. As will be  described further herein, all or a portion of the capsule wall  is degradable by contact with liquids in the GI tract so as to  allow those liquids to trigger the delivery of medication 100  by device 110. As used herein, \u201cGI tract\u201d  refers  to  the  esophagus, stomach,  Small  intestine,  large intestine  and  anus, while \u201cIntestinal tract\u201d refers to the small and large  intestine.  Various embodiments of the  invention  can  be  configured and arranged for delivery of medication 100 into  both the intestinal tract as well as the entire GI tract.   Device 110 including tissue penetrating member 140 can  be configured for the delivery of liquid, semi-liquid or solid  forms  of medication  100  or combinations  of all  three.  Whatever the form, medication 100 desirably has a material  consistency allowing the medication to be advanced out of  device 110, into the intestinal wall (small or large intestine)  or other luminal wall in the GI tract and then degrade within  the intestinal wall to release the drug or other therapeutic  agent 101. The material consistency of medication 100 can  include one or more of the hardness, porosity and solubility  of the preparation (in body fluids). The material consistency  can be achieved by selection and use of one or more of the  following: i) the compaction force used to make the prepa  ration; ii)  the use of one or more pharmaceutical disinte  grants known in the art;  iii)  use of other pharmaceutical  excipients;  iv)  the particle  size  and distribution  of the  preparation  (e.g.,  micronized  particles);  and  V)  use  of  micronizing and other particle formation methods known in  the art.   Capsule 120 is sized to be swallowed and pass through the  intestinal tract.  The size can also be adjusted depending  upon the amount of drug to be delivered as well as the  patients weight and adult vs. pediatric applications. Typi  cally, the capsule will have a tubular shape with curved ends  similar to a vitamin.  In these and related embodiments,   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   26  capsule lengths 120L can be in the range of 0.5 to 2 inches  and diameters 120D in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 inches with  other dimensions contemplated. The capsule 120 includes a  capsule wall 121 w, having an exterior surface 125 and an  interior Surface 124 defining an interior space or volume  124v. In some embodiments, the capsule wall 121 w can  include one or more apertures 126 sized for the outward  advancement of tissue penetrating members 140. In addition  to the other components of device 110, (e.g., the expandable  member etc.) the interior Volume can include one or more  compartments or reservoirs 127.   The capsule can be fabricated from various biodegradable  gelatin materials known in the pharmaceutical arts, but can  also include various enteric coatings 120c, configured to  protect the cap from degradation in the stomach (due to acids  etc.), and then Subsequently degrade in the in higher pH S  found in the small intestine or other area of the intestinal  tract.  In  various  embodiments, the capsule  120 can be  formed from multiple portions one or more of which may be  biodegradable. In many embodiments, capsule 120 can be  formed from two portions  120p such as a body portion  120p\" (herein body 120p\") and a cap portion 120p' (herein  cap 120p), where the cap fits onto the body, e.g., by sliding  over or under the  body (with  other arrangements  also  contemplated).  One portion  Such as the  cap  120p' can  include a first coating 120c'configured to degrade above a  first pH (e.g., pH 5.5) and the second portion such as the  body 120p\" can include a second coating 120c\" configured  to degrade above a second higher pH (e.g. 6.5).  Both the  interior 124 and exterior 125 surfaces of capsule 120 are  coated with coatings 120c and 120c\" so that that either  portion of the capsule will be substantially preserved until it  contacts fluid having the selected pH. For the case of body  120p\" this allows the structural integrity of the body 120p\"  to be maintained so as to keep balloon 172 inside the body  portion and not deployed until balloon 130 has expanded.  Coatings 120c' and 120c\" can include various methacrylate  and ethyl acrylate based coatings Such as those manufac  tured  by  Evonik  Industries  under  the  trade  name  EUDRAGIT. These and other dual coating configurations of  the capsule 120 allows for mechanisms in one portion of  capsule 120 to be actuated before those in the other portion  of the capsule. This is due to the fact that intestinal fluids  will first enter those portions where the lower pH coating has  degraded thus actuating triggers which are responsive to  Such fluids  (e.g.,  degradable  valves).  In  use.  Such  dual  coating embodiments for capsule 120 provide for targeted  drug delivery to a particular location in the Small intestine  (or other location in  the GI tract),  as well as improved  reliability in the delivery process. This is due to the fact that  deployment of a particular component, Such as aligner 160,  can be configured to begin in the upper area of the Small  intestine (e.g., the duodenum) allowing the capsule to be  aligned within the intestine for optimal delivery of the drug  (e.g., into the intestinal wall) as well as providing Sufficient  time  for  deployment/actuation  of other  components  to  achieve drug delivery  into  the intestinal  wall  while the  capsule is  still  in  the  small  intestine  or other selected  location.   As is discussed above, one or more portions of capsule  120 can be fabricated from various biocompatible polymers  known in the art, including various biodegradable polymers  which in a preferred embodiment can comprise cellulose,  gelatin materials PGLA (polylactic-co-glycolic acid). Other  suitable  biodegradable  materials  include  various  enteric  materials described herein  as well as lactide,  glycolide,   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   27  lactic  acid,  glycolic  acid,  para-dioxanone,  caprolactone,  trimethylene carbonate, caprolactone, blends and copoly  mers thereof.   In various embodiments, the wall 120w of the capsule is  degradable by contact  with  liquids  in  the  GI tract  for  example liquids in the small intestine. In preferred embodi  ments, the capsule wall is configured to remain intact during  passage through the stomach, but then to be degraded in the  Small intestine. In one or more embodiments, this can be  achieved by the use of an outer coating or layer 120c on the  capsule wall 120w, which only degrades in the higher pHs  found in the small intestine and serves to protect the under  lying capsule wall from degradation within the stomach  before the capsule reaches the small intestine (at which point  the drug delivery process is initiated by degradation of the  coating as is described herein). In use, such coatings allow  for the targeted delivery of a therapeutic agent in a selected  portion of the intestinal tract such as the Small intestine.   Similar to capsule 20, in various embodiments, capsule  120 can include various radio-opaque, echogenic or other  materials for location of the device using one or more  medical imaging modalities such as fluoroscopy, ultrasound,  MRI, etc.   As is discussed further herein, in many embodiments, one  or more of the deployment member 130, delivery member  172 or  deployable  aligner  160,  may correspond  to  an  expandable balloon that is shaped and sized to fit  within  capsule 120. Accordingly, for ease of discussion, deploy  ment member 130, delivery member 172 and deployable  aligner 160 will now be referred to as balloon 130, 160 and  172; however, it  should be appreciated that other devices  including various expandable devices are also contemplated  for these elements and may include for example, various  shape memory devices (e.g., an expandable basket made  from shape memory biodegradable polymer spires), expand  able piezo electric devices, and/or chemically expandable  devices having an expanded shape and size corresponding to  the interior volume 124v of the capsule 120.   One or more of balloons 130, 160 and 172 can comprise  various polymers known in  the  medical  device arts.  In  preferred embodiments such polymers can comprise one or  more types of polyethylene (PE) which may correspond to  low density PE(LDPE), linear low density PE (LLDPE),  medium density PE (MDPE) and high density PE (HDPE)  and other forms of polyethylene known in the art.  In one  more embodiments using polyethylene, the material may be  cross-linked using polymer irradiation methods known in  the art so. In particular embodiments radiation-based cross  linking may be used as to control the inflated diameter and  shape of the balloon by decreasing the compliance of the  balloon material. The amount or radiation may be selected to  achieve a particular amount of cross linking to  in  turn  produce a particular amount of compliance for a given  balloon, e.g., increased irradiation can be used to produce  stiffer less compliant balloon material. Other suitable poly  mers can include PET (polyethylene teraphalate), silicone  and polyurethane.  In  various embodiments balloons 130,  160 and 172 may also include various radio-opaque mate  rials known in the art such as barium sulfate to allow the  physician to ascertain the position and physical state of the  balloon (e.g.,  un-inflated, inflated or punctures. Balloons  130, 160 and 172 can be fabricated using various balloon  blowing methods known in the balloon catheters arts (e.g.,  mold blowing, free blowing, etc.) to have a shape and size  which corresponds approximately to the interior Volume  124v of capsule 120. In various embodiments one or more  of balloons 130, 160 and 172 and various connecting fea   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   28  tures (e.g., connecting tubes) can have a unitary construction  being formed from a single mold. Embodiments employing  such unitary construction provide the benefit of improved  manufacturability and reliability since fewer joints must be  made between one or more components of device 110.   Suitable shapes for balloons 130, 160 and 172 include  various cylindrical shapes having tapered or curved end  portions (an example of Such a shape including a hot dog).  In some embodiments, the inflated size (e.g., diameter) of  one or more of balloons 130, 160 and 172, can be larger than  capsule 120 so as to cause the capsule to come apart from the  force of inflation, (e.g., due to hoop stress). In other related  embodiments, the inflated size of one or more of balloons  130, 160 and 172 can be such that when inflated:  i) the  capsule 120 has sufficient contact with the walls of the small  intestine so as to  elicit  a peristaltic  contraction  causing  contraction of the Small intestine around the capsule, and/or  ii) the folds of the small intestine are effaced to allow. Both  of these results  allow for improved contact between the  capsule/balloon surface and the intestinal wall so as deliver  tissue penetrating members 40 over a selected area of the  capsule and/or delivery balloon 172. Desirably, the walls of  balloons 130, 160 and 172 will be thin and can have a wall  thickness in the range of 0.005 to 0.0001\" more preferably,  in the range of 0.005 to 0.0001, with specific embodiments  of 0.004, 0.003, 0.002, 0.001, and 0.0005). Additionally in  various embodiments, one or more of balloon 130, 160 or  172 can have a nested balloon configuration having an  inflation chamber 160IC and extended finger 160EF as is  shown in the embodiments of FIG. 13c. The connecting  tubing 163, connecting the inflation chamber 160IC can be  narrow to only allow the passage of gas 168, while the  connecting tubing 36 coupling the two halves of balloon 130  can be larger to allow the passage of water.   As indicated above, the aligner 160 will typically com  prise an expandable balloon and for ease of discussion, will  now be referred to as aligner balloon 160 or balloon 160.  Balloon 160 can be fabricated using materials and methods  described above. It has an unexpanded and expanded State  (also referred to as a deployed State).  In its expanded or  deployed state, balloon 160 extends the length of capsule  120 such that forces exerted by the peristaltic contractions of  the small intestine SI on capsule 120 serve to align the  longitudinal axis 120LA of the capsule 120 in a parallel  fashion with the longitudinal axis LAI of the small intestine  SI. This in turn serves to align the shafts of tissue penetrating  members 140 in a perpendicular fashion with the surface of  the intestinal wall IW to enhance and optimize the penetra  tion of tissue penetrating members 140 into the intestinal  wall IW. In addition to serving to align capsule 120 in the  Small  intestine,  aligner  160  is  also  configured to  push  delivery mechanism 170 out of capsule 120 prior to inflation  of delivery balloon 172 so that the delivery balloon and/or  mechanism is not encumbered by the capsule. In use, this  push out function of aligner 160 improves the reliability for  delivery of the therapeutic agent since it is not necessary to  wait for particular portions of the capsule (e.g., those over  lying the delivery mechanism) to be degraded before drug  delivery can occur.   Balloon 160 may be fluidically coupled to one or more  components of device 110 including balloons 130 and 172  by means of polymer tube or other fluidic couplings 162  which may include a tube 163 for coupling balloons 160 and  130 and a tube 164 for coupling balloon 160 and balloon  172. Tube 163 is  configured to allow balloon 160 to be  expanded/inflated by pressure from balloon 130 (e.g., pres  Sure generated the  mixture of chemical reactants  within   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   29  balloon 130) and/or otherwise allow the passage of liquid  between balloons 130 and 160 to initiate a gas generating  chemical reaction for inflation of one or both of balloons 130  and 160. Tube 164 connects balloon 160 to 172 so as to  allow for the inflation of balloon 172 by balloon 160. In  many embodiments, tube 164 includes or is  coupled to a  control valve 155 which is configured to open at a selected  pressure so as to control the inflation of balloon 172 by  balloon  160.  Tube  164 may thus  comprise a proximal  portion 164p connecting to the valve and a distal portion  164d leading from the valve. Typically, proximal and distal  portions 164p and 164d will be connected to a valve housing  158 as is described below.   Valve 155 may comprise a triangular or other shaped  section 156 of a material 157 which is placed within a the  chamber 158c of a valve housing 158 (alternately, it may be  placed directly within tubing 164). Section 157 is configured  to  mechanically degrade (e.g., tears, shears, delaminates,  etc.) at a selected pressure so as to allow the passage of gas  through  tube  164 and/or valve chamber 158c.  Suitable  materials 157 for valve 155 can include bees wax or other  form of wax and various adhesives known in the medical  arts which have a selectable sealing force/burst pressure.  Valve fitting 158 will typically comprise a thin cylindrical  compartment (made from biodegradable materials) in which  section 156 of material 157 is placed (as is shown in the  embodiment of FIG. 13.b) so as to seal the walls of chamber  158c together or otherwise obstruct passage of fluid through  the chamber. The release pressure of valve 155 can be  controlled through selection of one or more of the size and  shape of section 156 as well as the selection of material 157  (e.g., for properties such as adhesive strength, shear strength  etc.).  In use,  control  valve  155 allows for a sequenced  inflation of balloon 160 and 172 Such that balloon 160 is  fully or otherwise substantially inflated before balloon 172  is inflated. This, in turn, allows balloon 160 to push balloon  172 along with the rest of delivery mechanism 170 out of  capsule 120 (typically  from body portion  120p) before  balloon 172 inflates so that deployment of tissue penetrating  members 140 is not obstructed by capsule 120. In use, such  an approach improves the reliability of the penetration of  tissue penetrating members 140 into intestinal wall IW both  in  terms  of achieving  a desired  penetration  depth  and  delivering greater numbers of the penetrating members 140  contained in  capsule 120 since the advancement of the  members into intestinal wall IW is not obstructed by capsule  wall 1204:   As is  describe above, the inflated length 1601 of the  aligner balloon 160 is  sufficient to have the capsule 120  become aligned with the lateral axis of the small intestine  from  peristaltic  contractions  of the  intestine.  Suitable  inflated lengths 1601 for aligner 160 can include a range  between about/2 to two times the length 1201 of the capsule  120 before inflation  of aligner 160. Suitable  shapes for  aligner balloon 160 can include various elongated shapes  Such as  a hotdog like  shape.  In  specific  embodiments,  balloon 160 can include a first section 160' and a second  section 160\", where expansion of first section 160' is con  figured to advance delivery mechanism 170 out of capsule  120 (typically out of and second section 160\" is used to  inflate delivery balloon 172. In these and related embodi  ments,  first  and second sections  160' and 160\" can  be  configured to have a telescope-style inflation  where first  section 160' inflates first to push mechanism 170 out of the  capsule (typically  from body portion  120p') and second  section 160\" inflates to inflate delivery member 172. This  can be achieve by configuring first  section 160' to have   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   30  smaller diameter and volume than second section 160\" such  that first section 160' inflates first (because of its smaller  volume) and with second section 160\" not inflating until first  section 60' has substantially inflated. In one embodiment,  this can be facilitated by use of a control valve 155 (de  scribed above) connecting sections 160' and 160\" which  does not allow passage of gas into section 160\" until a  minimum pressure has been reached in section 160'. In some  embodiments, the aligner balloon can contain the chemical  reactants  which react upon mixture with water or other  liquid from the deploying balloon.   In many embodiments, the deployment member 130 will  comprise an expandable balloon, known as the deployment  balloon 130. In various embodiments, deployment balloon  30 is  configured  to  facilitate  deployment/expansion  of  aligner balloon 160 by use of a gas, for example, generation  of a gas 169 from a chemical. The gas may be generated by  the reaction of solid chemical reactants 165, such as an acid  166 (e.g.,  citric  acid)  and a base  166 (e.g.,  potassium  bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate and the like) which are  then mixed with water or other aqueous liquid 168. The  amount of reactants  can be chosen using Stoichiometric  methods to produce a selected pressure in one or more of  balloons 130, 160 and 72. The reactants 165 and liquids can  be stored separately in balloon 130 and 160 and then brought  together in  response to a trigger event, such as the pH  conditions  in  the small intestine.  The reactants  165 and  liquids  168 can be stored in either balloon, however in  preferred embodiments, liquid 168 is stored in balloon 130  and reactants 165 in balloon 160. To allow for passage of the  liquid 168 to start the reaction and/or the resulting gas 169,  balloon 130 may be coupled to aligner balloon 160 by means  of a connector tube 163 which also typically includes a  separation  means  150  such as  a  degradable  valve  150  described below. For embodiments where balloon 130 con  tains the liquid, tube 163 has sufficient diameter to allow for  the passage of sufficient water from balloon 130 to balloon  60 to produce the desired amount of gas to inflate balloon  160 as well inflate balloon 172. Also when balloon 130  contains the liquid, one or both of balloon 30 and tube 63 are  configured to allow for the passage of liquid to balloon 160  by one or more of the following: i) the compressive forced  applied to balloon 130 by peristaltic  contractions of the  small intestine on the exposed balloon 130; and ii) wicking  of liquid through tube 163 by capillary action.   Tube 163 will typically include a degradable separation  valve or other separation means 150 which separates the  contents of balloon 130, (e.g., water 158) from those of  balloon 160 (e.g., reactants 165) until the valve degrades.  Valve 150 can be fabricated from a material such as maltose,  which is degradable by liquid water so that the valve opens  upon exposure to water along with the various liquids in the  digestive tract. It may also be made from materials that are  degradable  responsive to  the higher pH's found in  the  intestinal fluids such as methacrylate based coatings. The  valve is desirably positioned at location on tube 163 which  protrudes above balloon 130 and/or is otherwise sufficient  exposed such that when cap 120p' degrades the valve 150 is  exposed to the intestinal liquids which enter the capsule. In  various embodiments, valve 150 can be positioned to lie on  the surface of balloon 130 or even protrude above it (as is  shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 16a and 16b), so that is  has  clear  exposure  to  intestinal  fluids  once  cap  120p'  degrades. Various embodiments of the invention provide a  number of structures  for  a  separation  valve  150,  for  example, a beam like structure (where the valve comprises  a beam that presses down on tube 163 and/or connecting   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   31  section  136),  or collar  type structure  (where the  valve  comprise a collar lying over tube 163 and/or connecting  section 136). Still other valve structures are also contem  plated.   Balloon 130 has a deployed and a non-deployed state. In  the deployed state, the deployment balloon 130 can have a  dome shape 130d which corresponds to the shape of an end  of the capsule. Other shapes 130s for the deployed balloon  130 are also contemplated. Such as spherical, tube-shape,  etc. The reactants 165 will typically include at least two  reactants 166 and 167, for example, an acid such as citric  acid and a base such as sodium bicarbonate. Other reactants  165 including other acids, e.g., ascetic acid and bases, e.g.,  sodium hydroxide are also contemplated. When the valve or  other separation means 150 opens, the reactants mix in the  liquid and produce a gas Such as carbon dioxide which  expands the aligner balloon 160 or other expandable mem  ber.   In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 13b, the  deployment balloon 130 can actually comprise a first and  second balloon 130' and 130\" connected by a tube 36 or  other connection means 136 (e.g.,  a connecting section).  Connecting tube  136 will  typically  include a separation  valve 150 that is degradable by a liquid as described above  and/or a liquid having a particular pH such as basic pH  found in  the small intestine  (e.g.,  5.5 or 6.5).  The two  balloons 130' and 130\" can each have a half dome shape  130hs allowing them to fit into the end portion of the capsule  when in the expanded State. One balloon can contain the  chemical reactant(s) 165 (e.g., Sodium bicarbonate, citric  acid, etc.) the other the liquid water 168, so that when the  valve is degraded the two components mix to form a gas  which inflates one or both balloons 130' and 130\" and in  turn, the aligner balloon 160.   In yet another alternative embodiment, balloon 130 can  comprise  a  multi-compartment  balloon  130mc,  that  is  formed or other constructed to have multiple compartments  130c. Typically, compartments 130c will include at least a  first  and a second compartment 134 and 135 which are  separated by a separation  valve 150 or other separation  means 150 as is shown in the embodiment of FIG. 14a. In  many embodiments, compartments 134 and 135 will have at  least a small connecting section 136 between them which is  where separation valve 150 will typically be placed. A liquid  168, typically water, can be disposed within first compart  ment 134 and one or more reactants 165 disposed in second  compartment 135 (which typically are solid though liquid  may also be used) as is shown in the embodiment of FIG.  14a. When valve 150 opens (e.g., from degradation caused  by fluids within the small intestine) liquid 168 enters com  partment 135 (or vice versa or both), the reactant(s) 165 mix  with the liquid and produce a gas 169 such as carbon dioxide  which expands balloon 130 which in turn can be used to  expand one or more of balloons 160 and 172.   Reactants 165 will typically include at least a first and a  second reactant, 166 and 167 for example, an acid such as  citric  acid  and a base  such  as  Sodium bi-carbonate  or  potassium bi-carbonate. As discussed herein,  in  various  embodiments they may be placed in one or more of balloon  130 (including compartments 134 and 135 or halves 130'  and 130\") and balloon 160. Additional reactants, including  other combinations of acids and bases which produce an  inert gas by product are also contemplated. For embodi  ments using citric acid and sodium or potassium bicarbon  ate, the ratio\u2019s between the two reactants (e.g., citric acid to  potassium bicarbonate) can be in the range of about 1:1 to  about 1:4, with a specific ratio of about 1:3. Desirably, solid   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   32  reactants 165 have little or no absorbed water. Accordingly,  one or more of the reactants, such as Sodium bicarbonate or  potassium bicarbonate can be pre-dried (e.g., by vacuum  drying)  before being placed  within  balloon  130.  Other  reactants 165 including other acids, e.g., ascetic acid and  bases are also  contemplated. The amounts of particular  reactants 165, including combinations of reactants can be  selected to produce particular pressures using known Stoi  chiometric equations for the particular chemical reactions as  well as the inflated volume of the balloon and the ideal gas  law (e.g., PV=nRT). In particular embodiments, the amounts  of reactants can be selected to produce a pressure selected  one or more of balloons 130, 160 and 172 to: i) achieve a  particular penetration depth into  the intestinal  wall; and  produce a particular diameter for one or more of balloons  130, 160 and 172; and iii) exert a selected amount of force  against intestinal wall IW. In particular embodiments, the  amount and ratios  of the reactants  (e.g.,  citric  acid and  potassium bicarbonate) can be selected to achieve pressures  in one more of the balloons 130, 160 and 172 in the range  of 10 to 15 psi, with smaller and larger pressures contem  plated. Again the amounts and ratio\u2019s of the reactants to  achieve these pressures can be determined using known  Stoichiometric equations.   In various embodiments of the invention using chemical  reactants 165 to generate gas 169, the chemical reactants  alone or in combination with the deployment balloon 130  can comprise a deployment engine for 180 deploying one or  both of the aligner balloon 160 and delivery mechanism 170  including delivery balloon  172.  Deployment engine 180  may also include embodiments using two deployment bal  loons 130 and 130\" (a dual dome configuration as shown in  FIG. 13b), or a multi compartment balloon 130mc as shown  in FIG. 14a. Other forms of a deployment engine 180 are  also contemplated by various embodiments of the invention  Such as  use of expandable piezo-electric  materials  (that  expand by application of a Voltage), springs and other shape  memory materials and various thermally expandable mate  rials.   One or more of the expandable balloons 130, 160 and 172  will also typically include a deflation valve 159 which serves  to deflate the balloon after inflation. Deflation valve 159 can  comprise biodegradable materials which are configured to  degrade upon exposure to the fluids in the Small intestine  and/or liquid in one of the compartments of the balloon so  as to create an opening or channel for escape of gas within  a particular balloon.  Desirably, deflation  valves  159 are  configured to degrade at a slower rate than valve 150 to  allow sufficient time for inflation of balloons, 130, 160 and  172 before the deflation valve degrades. In various embodi  ments, of a compartmentalized balloon 130, deflation valve  159 can correspond to a degradable section 139 positioned  on an end portion 131 of the balloon as is shown in the  embodiment of FIG. 14a. In this and related embodiments,  when degradable section 139 degrades from exposure to the  liquid,  balloon  wall 132 tears or otherwise comes apart  providing for a high assurance of rapid deflation. Multiple  degradable sections 139 can be placed at various locations  within balloon wall 132.   In various embodiments of balloon 172, deflation valve  159 can correspond to a tube valve 173 attached to the end  172e of the delivery balloon 172 (opposite to the end which  is  coupled to  the  aligner balloon)  as  is  shown in  the  embodiment of FIG. 13b. The tube valve 173 comprises a  hollow tube 173t having a lumen that is  obstructed at a  selected location 1731 with a material 173m such as maltose  that degrades upon exposure to fluid Such as the fluid in the   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   33  small intestine. The location 1731 of the obstructing material  173m in tube 173t is selected to provide sufficient time for  the delivery balloon 172 to inflate and deliver the tissue  penetrating members 40 into the intestinal wall IW before  the obstructing material dissolves to open valve 173. Typi  cally, this will be close to the end 173e of the tube 173t, but  not quite so as to allow time for liquid to have to wick into  the tube lumen before it reaches material 173m. According  to one or more embodiments, once the deflation valve 173  opens, it not only serves to deflate the delivery balloon 172  but also the aligner balloon 160 and deployment balloon 130  since in many embodiments, all three are fludicially con  nected (aligner balloon being fludically connected to deliv  ery balloon 172 and the deployment balloon  130 being  fludically connected to aligner balloon 160). Opening of the  deflation valve 173 can be facilitated by placing it on the end  172e of the delivery balloon 172 that is forced out of capsule  120 by inflation  of the aligner balloon  160 so that the  deflation valve has good exposure to liquids in the Small  intestine.  Similar tube deflation  valves  173 can also  be  positioned on one or both of aligner balloon 162 and the  deployment balloon  130.  In  these  later  two cases,  the  obstructing material in the tube valve can be configured to  degrade over a time period to allow  sufficient  time for  inflation of delivery balloon 172 and advancement of tissue  penetrating members 140 into the intestinal wall.   Additionally, as further backup for insured deflation, one  or more puncture elements 182 can be attached to the inside  Surface 124 of the capsule Such that when a balloon (e.g.,  balloon  130,  160,  172) fully  inflates  it  contacts  and is  punctured by the puncture element 182. Puncture elements  182 can comprise short protrusions from surface 124 having  a pointed tip.  In another alternative or additional embodi  ment of means for balloon deflation, one or more of the  tissue penetrating members 140 can be directly coupled to  the wall of 172w of balloon 172 and configured to tear away  from the balloon when they detach, tearing the balloon wall  in the process.   A discussion will now be presented of tissue penetrating  members 140. Tissue penetrating member 140 can be fab  ricated from various drugs and other therapeutic agents 101,  one or more pharmaceutical excipients (e.g., disintegrants,  stabilizers, etc.) and one or more biodegradable polymers.  The later materials chosen to confer desired structural and  material properties to the penetrating member (for example,  column strength for insertion into the intestinal  wall, or  porosity and hydrophilicity for control the release of drug).  Referring now to FIGS. 18a-18?. in many embodiments, the  penetrating member 140 can be formed to have a shaft 144  and a needle tip 145 or other pointed tip 145 so as to readily  penetrate  tissue  of the  intestinal  wall  as  shown in  the  embodiment of FIG. 18a. In preferred embodiments, tip 145  has a trocar shape as is shown in the embodiment of FIG.  18c. Tip 145 may comprise various degradable materials  (within the body of the tip or as a coating). Such as Sucrose  or  other  Sugar which  increase  the  hardness  and tissue  penetrating properties of the tip. Once placed in the intes  tinal wall, the penetrating member 140 is degraded by the  interstitial fluids within the wall tissue so that the drug or  other therapeutic agent 101 dissolves in those fluids and is  absorbed into the blood stream. One or more of the size,  shape and chemical composition of tissue penetrating mem  ber 140 can be selected to allow for dissolution and absorp  tion of drug 101 in a matter of seconds, minutes or even  hours. Rates of dissolution can be controlled through the use  of various disintegrants known in the pharmaceutical arts.  Examples of disintegrants include, but are not limited to,   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   34  various starches such as Sodium starch glycolate and various  cross linked polymers such as carboxymethyl cellulose. The  choice of disintegrants can be specifically adjusted for the  environment within the wall of the small intestine.   Tissue penetrating member 140 will also typically include  one or more tissue retaining features 143 Such as a barb or  hook to retain the penetrating member within the tissue of  the intestinal wall IW after advancement. Retaining features  143 can be arranged in various patterns 143p to enhance  tissue retention such as two or more barbs symmetrically or  otherwise distributed around and along member shaft 144 as  is shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 18a and 18b. Addi  tionally,  in  many embodiments, penetrating member will  also include a recess or other mating feature 146 for attach  ment to a coupling component on delivery mechanism 170.  Tissue penetrating member 140 is desirably configured to  be detachably coupled to platform 175 (or other component  of delivery mechanism 170), so that after advancement of  the tissue penetrating member 140 into the intestinal wall,  the penetrating member detaches from the balloon. Detach  ability can be implemented by a variety of means including:  i) the snugness or fit between the opening 174 in platform  175 and the member shaft 144); ii) the configuration and  placement of tissue retaining features 143 on penetrating  member 140; and iii) the depth of penetration of shaft 144  into the intestinal wall. Using one or more of these factors,  penetrating member 140 be configured to detach as a result  of balloon deflation (where the retaining features 143 hold  the penetrating member 140 in tissue as the balloon deflates  or otherwise pulls back away from the intestinal wall) and/or  the forces exerted on capsule 120 by a peristaltic contraction  of the small intestine.   In a specific embodiment, the detachability and retention  of tissue penetrating member 140 in the intestinal wall IW  can be enhanced by configuring the tissue penetrating mem  ber shaft 144 to have an inverse taper 144t as is shown in the  embodiment of FIG. 18c. The taper 144t on the shaft 144 is  configured such that the application of peristaltic contractile  forces from the intestinal wall on the shaft result in the shaft  being forced inward (e.g., Squeezed inward). This is due to  the conversion by shaft taper 144t of the laterally applied  peristaltic force PF to an orthogonal force OF acting to force  the shaft inward into the intestinal wall. In use, such inverse  tapered shaft configurations serve to retain tissue penetrating  member 140 within the intestinal wall so as to detach from  platform 175 (or other component of delivery mechanism  170) upon deflation of balloon 172. In additional embodi  ments, tissue penetrating members 140 having an inverse  tapered shaft may also include one or more retaining fea  tures  143  to  further enhance the retention  of the tissue  penetrating member within intestinal wall IW once inserted.  As described above, in various embodiments, tissue pen  etrating member 140 can be fabricated from a number of  drugs and other therapeutic agents 101. Also according to  one or more embodiments, the tissue penetrating member  may be fabricated entirely from drug 101 or may have other  constituent components as well, e.g., various pharmaceutical  excipients (e.g., binders, preservatives, disintegrants, etc.),  polymers conferring desired mechanical properties, etc. Fur  ther, in various embodiments one or more tissue penetrating  members 140 can carry the same or a different drug 101 (or  other therapeutic agent) from other tissue penetrating mem  bers. The former configuration allows for the delivery of  greater amounts of a particular drug 101, while the later,  allows two or more different drugs to be delivered into the  intestinal  wall at about the same time to  facilitate  drug  treatment regimens requiring Substantial concurrent delivery   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   35  of multiple drugs. In embodiments of device 110, having  multiple delivery assemblies 178 (e.g., two, one on each face  of balloon  172), a  first  assembly 178  can carry  tissue  penetrating members having a first drug 101 and a second  assembly 178\" can carry tissue penetrating members having  a second drug 101.   Typically, the drug or other therapeutic agent 101 carried  by the tissue penetrating member 140 will be mixed in with  a biodegradable material  105 to  form tissue penetrating  member 140. Material 105 may include one or more biode  gradable polymers such as  PGLA, cellulose,  as well as  Sugars  such  as  maltose or other biodegradable material  described herein or known in the art. In such embodiments,  the penetrating member 140 may comprise a substantially  heterogeneous mixture of drug 101 and biodegradable mate  rial 105. Alternatively, the tissue penetrating member 140  may include a portion 141 formed substantially from bio  degradable material 105 and a separate section 142 that is  formed from or contains drug 101 as shown in the embodi  ment of FIG. 18d. In one or more embodiments, section 142  may correspond to a pellet, slug, cylinder or other shaped  section  142s of drug 101.  Shaped section  142s may be  pre-formed as a separate section which is then inserted into  a cavity 142c in tissue penetrating member 140 as is shown  in the embodiments of FIGS. 18e and 18f. Alternatively  section 142s may be formed by adding of drug preparation  100 to cavity 142c. In embodiments, where drug preparation  100 is added to cavity 142c, preparation may be added in as  a powder, liquid, or gel which is poured or injected into  cavity 142c. Shaped section 142s may be formed of drug  101 by itself or a drug preparation containing drug 101 and  one or more binders, preservatives, disintegrates and other  excipients.  Suitable  binders  include  polyethylene glycol  (PEG) and other binders  known in  the  art.  In  various  embodiments, the PEG or other binder may comprise in the  range of about 10 to 90% weight percent of the section 142s,  with a preferred embodiment for insulin preparations of  about 25-90 weight percent. Other excipients which may be   5   15   25   35   36  but the data in the table is also applicable to other embodi  ments of section 142 described herein.   In various embodiments, the weight of tissue penetrating  member 140 can range between about 10 to 15 mg, with  larger and Smaller weights contemplated. For embodiments  of tissue penetrating member 140 fabricated from maltose,  the weight can range from about 11 to 14 mg. In various  embodiments, depending upon the drug 101 and the desired  delivered dose, the weight percent of drug in member 140  can  range from  about  0.1  to  about  15% In  exemplary  embodiments these weight per cents correspond to embodi  ments of members 140 fabricated from maltose or PGLA,  however they are also applicable to any of the biodegradable  materials 105 used in the fabrication of members 140. The  weight percent of drug or other therapeutic agent 101 in  member 140 can be adjusted depending upon the desired  dose as well as to provide for structural and stoichiometric  stability of the drug and also to achieve a desired concen  tration profile of the drug in the blood or other tissue of the  body. Various stability  tests and models (e.g.,  using the  Arrhenius equation) known in the art and/or known rates of  drug chemical degradation may be used to make specific  adjustments in the weight per cent range. Table 1  lists the  dose and weight per cent range for insulin and number of  other drugs which may be delivered by tissue penetrating  member 140. In some cases the tables lists ranges as well a  single value for the dose. It should be appreciated that these  values are exemplary and other values recited herein includ  ing the claims are also considered. Further, embodiments of  the invention also consider variations around these values  including for example, t1, it5,  t10,  t25, and even larger  variations.

Alterna  tively, drug 101 and/or drug preparation 100 may be in solid  or liquid form and then added to the biodegradable material  105 in liquid form with the mixture then formed into the  penetrating member 140 using molding or other forming  method known in the polymer arts.   Desirably, embodiments of the tissue penetrating member  140 comprising a drug or other therapeutic agent 101 and  degradable material 105 are formed at temperatures which  do not produce any Substantial thermal degradation of drug  including drugs such as various peptides and proteins. This  can be achieved through the use of room-temperature curing  polymers and room temperature molding and solvent evapo  ration techniques known in the art.  In particular embodi  ments, the amount of thermally  degraded drug or other  therapeutic agent within the tissue penetrating member is  desirably less than about 10% by weight and more prefer  ably, less than 5% and still  more preferably less than 1%.  The thermal degradation temperature(s) for a particular drug  are either known or can be determined using methods known  in the art and then this temperature can be used to select and  adjust  the  particular  polymer processing  methods (e.g.,  molding, curing. Solvent evaporation methods etc.) to mini  mize the temperatures and associated level of drug thermal  degradation.   A description will be provided of delivery mechanism  170. Typically, the mechanism will comprise a delivery  assembly 178 (containing tissue penetrating members 140)  that is attached to delivery balloon 172 as is shown in the  embodiment of FIGS. 16a and 16b. Inflation of the delivery  balloon provides a mechanical force for engaging delivery  assembly  172 outwards  from  the  capsule  and into  the  intestinal wall IW so as to insert tissue penetrating members  140 into the wall.  In  various embodiments, the delivery  balloon 172 can have an elongated shape with two relatively  flat faces 172f connected by an articulated accordion-like  body 172b. The flat faces 172f can be configured to press  against the  intestinal  wall  (IW)  upon expansion of the  balloon 172 so as to insert the tissue penetrating members  (TPMs) 140 into the intestinal wall. TPMS 140 (either by  themselves or as part of a delivery assembly 178 described  below) can be positioned on one or both faces  172f of  balloon 172 to allow insertion of drug containing TPMs 40  on opposite sides of the intestinal wall. The faces 172f of  balloon 172 may have sufficient surface area to allow for  placement of a number of drug containing TPMS 140 on  each face.   Referring now to  FIG. 19, a  description will  now be  provided of the assembly of delivery assembly 178. In a first  step 300, one or more tissue penetrating members 140 can  be detachably  coupled to  a biodegradable advancement  structure 175 which may correspond to a support platform  175 (also known as platform 175). In preferred embodi  ments, platform 175 includes one or more openings 174 for  insertion of members 140 as shown in step 300. Openings  174 are sized to allow for insertion and retention of members  140 in platform 175 prior to expansion of balloon 172 while  allowing for their detachment from the platform upon their  penetration into the intestinal wall. Support platform 175  can then be positioned within a carrying structure 176 as  shown in step 301. Carrying structure 176 may correspond  to a well structure 176 having side walls 176s and a bottom  wall 176b which define a cavity or opening 176c. Platform  175 is desirably attached to inside surface of bottom wall  176b using adhesive or other joining methods known in the  art. Well structure 176 can comprise various polymer mate   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   38  rials and may be formed using vacuum forming techniques  known in the polymer processing arts.  In many embodi  ments, opening 176O can be covered with a protective film  177 as shown in step 302. Protective film 177 has properties  selected to function as a barrier to protect tissue penetrating  members 140 from humidity and oxidation while still allow  ing tissue penetrating members 140 to penetrate the film as  is described below. Film 177 can comprise various water  and/or oxygen impermeable polymers which are desirably  configured to be biodegradable in the small intestine and/or  to pass inertly through the digestive tract. It may also have  a multi-ply construction with particular layers selected for  impermeability to a given Substance, e.g.,  oxygen, water  vapor etc. In use, embodiments employing protective film  177 serve to increase the shelf life of therapeutic agent 101  in tissue penetrating members 140, and in turn, the shelf life  of device 110. Collectively, support platform 175 attached  tissue penetrating members 140, well structure 176, and film  177 can comprise a delivery assembly 178. Delivery assem  blies 178 having one or more drugs or therapeutic agents 101  contained within tissue penetrating member 40 or other drug  delivery means can be pre-manufactured, stored and Subse  quently used for the manufacture of device 110 at a later  date. The shelf life of assembly 178 can be further enhanced  by filling cavity 176c of the sealed assembly 178 with an  inert gas such as nitrogen.   Referring back to FIGS. 16a and 16b, assemblies 178 can  be positioned on one or both faces 172f of balloon 172. In  preferred embodiments, assemblies 178 are positioned on  both faces 172f (as shown in FIG. 16a) so as to provide a  substantially equal distribution of force to opposite sides of  the intestinal wall IW upon expansion of balloon 172. The  assemblies 178 may be attached to faces 172fusing adhe  sives or other joining methods known in the polymer arts.  Upon expansion  of balloon  172,  TPMS 140 penetrate  through  film  177,  enter the  intestinal  wall  IW and are  retained there by retaining elements 143 and/or other retain  ing features of TPM 140 (e.g., an inverse tapered shaft 144t)  such that they detach from platform 175 upon deflation of  balloon 172.   In various embodiments, one or more of balloons 130,  160 and 172 can be packed inside capsule 120 in a folded,  furled  or other  desired  configuration  to  conserve  space  within the interior volume 124v of the capsule. Folding can  be done using preformed creases or other folding feature or  method known in the medical balloon arts.  In particular  embodiments, balloon 130, 160 and 172 can be folded in  selected orientations to achieve one or more of the follow  ing: i) conserve space, ii) produce a desired orientation of a  particular  inflated  balloon;  and  iii)  facilitate  a  desired  sequence of balloon inflations. The embodiments shown in  FIGS. 15a-15f illustrate an embodiment of a method of  folding  and  various  folding  arrangements.  However,  it  should be appreciated that this folding arrangement and the  resulting balloon orientations are exemplary and others may  also be used. In this and related embodiments, folding can be  done manually, by automated machine or a combination of  both. Also in many embodiments, folding can be facilitated  by using a single multi-balloon assembly 7 (herein assembly  7) comprising balloons 130, 160, 170; valve chamber 158  and assorted connecting tubings 162 as is  shown in the  embodiments of FIGS. 13a and 13b. FIG. 13a shows an  embodiment of assembly 7 having a single dome construc  tion for balloon 130, while FIG. 13b shows the embodiment  of assembly 7 having dual balloon/dome configuration for  balloon 130. Assembly 7 can be fabricated using a thin  polymer film which is vacuum-formed into the desired shape   \fUS 9,486,414 B2   39  using various vacuum forming and other related methods  known in the polymer processing arts.  Suitable polymer  films include polyethylene films having a thickness in the  range of about  0.003  to  about 0.010\",  with a  specific  embodiment of 0.005\".  In  preferred  embodiments,  the  assembly is fabricated to have a unitary construction so as to  eliminate the need for joining one or more components of  the assembly (e.g., balloons 130,160, etc.). However, it is  also contemplated for assembly 7 to  be fabricated from  multiple portions (e.g., halves), or components (e.g., bal  loons) which are then joined using various joining methods  known in the polymer/medical device arts.   Referring now to FIGS. 15a-15f. 16a-16b and 17a-17b, in  a first folding step 210, balloon 160 is folded over onto valve  fitting  158 with balloon  172 being flipped over to  the  opposite side of valve fitting 158 in the process (see FIG.  15a). Then in step 211, balloon 172 is folded at a right angle  to the folded combination of balloon 160 and valve 158 (see  FIG. 15b). Then, in step 212 for dual dome embodiments of  balloon 130, the two halves 130' and 130\" of balloon 130 are  folded onto each other, leaving valve 150 exposed (see FIG.  15c, for single dome embodiments of balloon 130, is folded  over onto itself see FIG. 15e). A final folding step 213 can  be done whereby folded balloon 130 is folded over 180\u00b0 to  the opposite side of valve fitting 158 and balloon 160 to  yield a final folded assembly 8 for dual dome configurations  shown in the FIG. 15e and a final folded assembly 8 for  single dome configurations shown in  FIGS. 15e and 15f.  One or more delivery assemblies 178 are then be attached to  assembly 8 in  step  214 (typically  two the faces  72f of  balloon 72)  to  yield a final  assembly 9 (shown in  the  embodiments of FIGS. 16a and 16b) which is then inserted  into  capsule  120. After an  insertion  step  215,  the  final  assembled version of device 110 with inserted assembly 9 is  shown FIGS. 17a and 17b.   Referring now to FIGS. 20a-20i, a description will be  provided of a method of using device 110 to deliver medi  cation 101 to a site in the GI tract such as the wall of the  small or large intestine.  It should be appreciated that the  steps and there order is exemplary and other steps and orders  also contemplated. After device 110 enters the small intes  tine SI, the cap coating 120c' is degraded by the basic pH in  the upper Small intestine causing degradation of cap 120p' as  shown in step 400 in FIG. 20b. Valve 150 is then exposed to  fluids  in  the  Small  intestine  causing the  valve to begin  degrade as is shown in step 401 in FIG. 20c. Then, in step  402, balloon 130 expands (due to generation of gas 169) as  shown in FIG. 20d. Then, in step 403, section 160' of balloon  160 begins to expand to start to push assembly 178 out of the  capsule body as shown in  FIG. 20e. Then, in step 404,  sections 160' and 160\" of balloon 160 become fully inflated  to completely push assembly 178 out of the capsule body  extending the capsule length 1201 So as to serve to align  capsule lateral axis 120AL with the lateral axis of the small  intestine LAI as shown in FIG. 20f. During this time, valve  155 is  beginning to  fail  from the increased pressure in  balloon 60 (due to the fact that the balloon has fully inflated  and there is no other place for gas 169 to go). Then, in step  405, valve 155 has completely opened, inflating balloon 172  which then pushes the now completely exposed assembly  178 (having been pushed completely out of body 120p\")  radially outward into the intestinal wall IW as shown in FIG.  20g. Then, in step 406, balloon 172 continues to expand to  now advance tissue penetrating members into the intestinal  wall IW as shown in FIG. 20h. Then, in step 407, balloon  172, (along with balloons 160 and 130) has deflated pulling  back and leaving tissue penetrating members retained in the   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   40  intestinal  wall IW. Also, the body portion  120p\" of the  capsule has completely degraded (due to degradation of  coating 120c\") along with other biodegradable portions of  device 110. Any portion not degraded is  carried distally  through the Small intestine by peristaltic contraction from  digestion and is ultimately excreted.

No.  12/870,616, filed Aug. 27, 2010 now abandoned), which is  a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/877,  758, filed Jun. 25, 2004 (now abandoned), which claims the  benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/482,677, filed  Jun. 26, 2003, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/575,  307, filed May 28, 2004, the specifications of which are  incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.   10   15   FIELD OF THE INVENTION   The present invention relates to the field of controlled  release and Sustained-release drug delivery systems, and  particularly to the field of injectable drug delivery implants.   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   There are many useful drugs on the market today for  which traditional means of administration are far from ideal.  Bolus injections and oral unit doses typically result in a high  initial systemic concentration of the active agent, in excess  of the therapeutic concentration, which falls off over time  and which will fall below the therapeutic concentration if  another bolus is not timely administered. The result is that  the ideal therapeutic concentration is not consistently main  tained,  there  is  a risk  of toxicity  associated  with high  systemic exposure to the drug, and the maintenance of a  minimally  effective  concentration  is  dependent  upon  repeated administration at prescribed intervals. Patient com  pliance with a dosing regimen is difficult to ensure, espe  cially where the course of therapy is long or of indeterminate  or lifetime duration. There is a need for methods to deliver  these drugs more effectively, so that therapeutic concentra  tions are maintained constantly in the tissues intended to be  treated  over an extended period  of time,  with  minimal  Vulnerability to the  vagaries of patient  compliance, and  ideally  with  minimal systemic exposure or exposure of  uninvolved tissues and organs.   Modern drug discovery methods have led to the devel  opment of many drugs which are far more potent, yet have  poorer solubility, than drugs developed through traditional  medicinal chemistry methods. The development of these  often-complex drugs has resulted in a need for methods to  deliver such drugs more effectively and efficiently as well.  Extended-release  and controlled-release  drug delivery  systems  have  been  developed  to  address  these  needs.  Implanted pumps and reservoirs, with various mechanisms  for regulating release of drugs, were among the first Solu  tions to be developed. A wide variety of polymeric matrices,  permeated with drug Substance, have also been developed  which serve as implantable drug reservoirs. These polymeric  implants gradually release drug over the course of days,  weeks, or months as the contained drug diffuses through and  out of the matrix and into the Surrounding tissue. Three  principal advantages provided by polymeric drug delivery  compositions are:   (1)  Localized  delivery  of drug.  The product  can  be  implanted directly at the site where drug action is needed  and hence systemic exposure of the drug can be reduced.   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   2  This becomes especially important for toxic drugs which are  related to various systemic side effects (such as the chemo  therapeutic drugs).   (2) Sustained delivery of drug. The drug is released over  extended periods, eliminating the need for multiple injec  tions  or  oral  doses.  This  improves patient  compliance,  especially for drugs for chronic indications requiring fre  quent  administration,  such  as  replacement  therapy  for  enzyme or hormone deficiencies, or for extended antibiotic  treatments for Such tenacious diseases as tuberculosis.   (3) Stabilization of the drug. The polymer matrix protects  the drug from the physiological environment, particularly  circulating enzymes, thereby improving stability in  vivo.  This makes the technology particularly attractive for the  delivery of labile proteins and peptides.   For the reasons above, the use of drug-infused polymer  implants as Sustained-release drug delivery devices is now  well established. One class of existing implants consists of  preformed devices, ranging in size from matchstick-sized  cylindrical rods such as the NorplantTM (levonorgestrel) and  ZoladexTM (goserelin  acetate)  implants,  to  microspheres  such as are sold under the trade name Lupron Depot TM  (leuprolide acetate).   A major disadvantage of the macroscopic devices is their  physical size. Implantation of ZoladexTM rods, for instance,  requires the use of 14- or 16-gauge needles, and implanta  tion of NorplantTM rods requires a surgical incision under  local  anesthesia,  with  similar  Subsequent procedures  to  replace and/or remove them. (The ZoladexTM rods are bio  erodable,  whereas  NorplantTM implants  are  based on a  non-bioerodable  silicone.)  Self-administration  of  such  implants is  not feasible, and the required intervention of  trained medical personnel greatly raises the cost and incon  venience of Such treatments.   Drug-containing polymer implants have been reduced in  size by the expedient of grinding or milling a mixture of a  drug Substance and a gel-forming polymer at low tempera  ture, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,738. The resulting  powder is then Suspended in a non-aqueous viscous solvent,  Such polyethylene glycol or a biocompatible oil, to obtain an  injectable composition.   The size  problem has  similarly  been overcome with  microsphere implants, which can be administered (and self  administered where appropriate) by injection of an aqueous  suspension  of the  microspheres.  Lupron  Depot TM,  for  example, can be comfortably injected with a 22- or 23-gauge  needle. Because microspheres are not retrievable from the  body, they are necessarily based on bioerodable polymers.  However, if an aqueous Suspension of microspheres is stored  for any length  of time,  the drug will  diffuse  from the  particles into the aqueous phase, furthermore the bioerod  able  matrix itself is  prone to  hydrolysis  in  an aqueous  environment. For these reasons, the injectable aqueous Sus  pension must be prepared at the time of injection. A second  disadvantage is the need for intramuscular injection. Finally,  preparation of the microspheres is a complex process that is  not easily carried out reproducibly and reliably, and regu  latory  validation  of the manufacturing process  can be a  significant obstacle to commercialization of Such products.  Another class of implants differing from pre-formed solid  devices is injectable liquids. Upon injection, these are trans  formed in situ into Solid implants. This class of implants is  typified by compositions that transform from a drug-con  taining  liquid  phase to  a  drug-infused  gel  phase  upon  exposure to a physiological environment. Such in situ gell  ing  compositions have several advantages:  they can be  readily and reliably manufactured by standard methods, they   \fUS 9,566,336 B2   3  can be stored in the form of easily-injected liquids, they can  be placed locally to achieve local delivery, and they can flow  prior to gelling so as to fill Voids and create a less-visible  Subcutaneous implant. In addition, a gelling, implant can  serve  as  a  scaffold  for  cellular  colonization  and tissue  growth.   There are various changes in conditions that can trigger  the gelling of an in situ gelling composition. Among these  are changes in pH, osmolality, temperature, water concen  tration, and alterations in specific ion concentrations.   Temperature-sensitive in situ gelling compositions gen  erally change from a Sol to a gel when the temperature  exceeds a critical Solution temperature, which in the case of  drug delivery systems must be reasonably close to body  temperature. An example is the polyethylene oxide-polypro  pylene oxide block copolymer, sold under the trade name  PluronicTM  F  127.  A 25-40% aqueous  solution  of this  material will gel at about body temperature, and drug release  from Such a gel occurs over a period of up to one week. Such  compositions have the disadvantage that they must be care  fully protected from premature gelling, through refrigerated  storage, and no bioerodable polymer has yet been developed  that undergoes a sol-gel transition at about body tempera  ture.   A hydrogel whose drug release profile is both tempera  ture- and pH-modulated has also been reported (T. G. Park,  in Biomaterials 20:517-521 (1999)).   Another class of compositions form gels upon contact  with water. For example, glycerol monooleate (GMO) con  taining a drug can be injected as a liquid lamellar phase,  which upon injection and exposure to water forms a highly  viscous cubic-phase hydrate. The drug is released from the  cubic phase over the course of several days. An example of  an injectable  drug depot product based on GMO is  the  metronidazole dental gel formulation marketed under the  trade name ElyZolTM. Due to the high water content of the  cubic phase, GMO formulations are prone to  rapid drug  release and are limited in duration of effect to no more than  about five days.   There are very few biocompatible liquid crystal compo  sitions that meet the requirement for phase transition to a  Sufficiently viscous state at physiological conditions. Poly  mers that precipitate upon contact with water, on the other  hand, are numerous, and present a more versatile approach  to the formulation of compositions that gel upon contact  with water. Approaches based on in situ gelling composi  tions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,938,763, 5,077,049,  5,278,202, 5,324,519 and 5,780,044, all of which are incor  porated herein by reference.   For example, the AtrigelTM drug delivery system consists  of a bioerodable poly(DL-lactide-glycolide) (PLGA) copo  lymer (75:25 molar ratio) dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrroli  done (NMP). Pharmaceuticals  may be blended into  this  PLGA solution at the point of manufacture, or they may be  added by the physician at the time of use. The liquid product  is  injected  Subcutaneously  or  intramuscularly  through  a  small gauge needle, whereupon displacement of the NMP  carrier with water in the tissue fluids causes the PLGA to  precipitate, forming a solid film or implant. The drug incor  porated within the implant is then released in a controlled  manner as the polymer matrix erodes with time in the body.  PLGA-based implants of this type can release drug over a  period of several months. An example of a product employ  ing this technology is  the leuprolide acetate formulation  marketed under the trade name EligardTM.   The AtrigelTM system uses N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP)  as a solvent for the PLGA copolymer. NMP is  a water   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   4  miscible, low-molecular-weight and low-viscosity solvent  that rapidly diffuses from the implant. Rapid solvent escape  from the injected composition can lead to rapid and uneven  precipitation of the polymer, shrinking of the implant, and  local irritation or even necrosis due to exposure of tissues to  a high local concentration of Solvent.  The use of liquid polymers as solvents for in situ gel  forming compositions has been described in U.S. Pat. No.  5,607,686 and in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/169,012 (US  2003/0082234), corresponding to international patent appli  cation PCT/KR00/01508 (WO 01/45742). However, accord  ing to these patents, polyethylene glycol is not suitable as a  Solvent for PLGA.   In situ polymer-precipitation systems solve many of the  problems associated with implants, but some difficulties  remain. There is  a need for in situ gelling drug delivery  systems  with improved properties,  a simple preparation  procedure and low toxicity of excipient.   PEGs have the advantage of solubilizing different drugs  than NMP; in particular pegylated proteins can be expected  to be more soluble and/or miscible in PEGs than in NMP. An  additional advantage is that PEGs are available in different  molecular weights and have different viscosities. In many  instances it important to be able to control the viscosity of  the injected gelling agent, which is not possible with NMP.   BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION   The morphology of the polymer gel produced during the  precipitation process is dependent upon the nature of the  organic solvent, which can vary from a dense sponge-like  structure to an open meshwork with numerous voids and  channels (P. D. Graham et al., J. Controlled Release 58:233  245 (1999)). This morphology in turn affects both the initial  burst and the sustained release kinetics of the gel. Solvents  used to date for this purpose have largely been selected from  the chemists traditional  menu of low-molecular weight  species, such as NMP, DMA, alcohols, and the like,  as  described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,044.   Applicants have found that polyethylene glycol can serve  as the solvent for PLGA, and have found that the gel phase  produced upon exchange of the PEG with water exhibits  desirable  sustained-release  kinetics  for  small-molecule  drugs.   Accordingly, the present invention provides an in situ  gelling drug delivery formulation comprising a drug Sub  stance and a PLGA polymer, dissolved dispersed or Sus  pended in  PEG as  the  liquid  phase solvent.  In  certain  embodiments, the liquid phase solvent may include, or even  consist  essentially  of  a prodrug of the  drug Substance  combined with PEG. The compositions of the invention, on  contact with water or bodily fluids, undergo exchange of the  PEG for water, resulting in precipitation of the both the  polymer and the drug and Subsequent formation of a gel  phase within which the drug Substance is incorporated. The  drug Substance Subsequently diffuses from the gel over an  extended period of time.   The present invention also provides methods for making  in situ gelling drug delivery formulations comprising a drug  substance and a  PLGA polymer, dissolved dispersed or  suspended in PEG as the liquid phase solvent. The invention  also provides methods for preparing Sustained-release drug  depots in situ by the use of Such formulations.

FIG. 4 shows the release profile for morphine from a  morphine-diclofenac co-drug/PLGA (70:30)/benzyl benzo  ate formulation (20% w/v PLGA in benzyl benzoate).   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE  INVENTION   The present invention provides injectable in situ gelling  pharmaceutical compositions, comprising: (a) a drug Sub  stance; (b) a liquid, semi-solid, or wax polyethylene glycol  (PEG); and (c) a biocompatible and bioerodable polymer  that is dissolved, dispersed, or suspended in the PEG.   A\u201cliquid' PEG is a polyethylene glycol that is a liquid at  20-30\u00b0  C.  and  ambient  pressure.  In  certain  preferred  embodiments, the average MW of the liquid PEG is between  about 200 and about 400. The polyethylene glycol may be  linear or it  may be a bioabsorbable branched PEG, for  example as disclosed in U.S. Patent application No. 2002/  0032298. In certain alternative embodiments the PEG may  be a semi-solid or wax, in which case the M will be larger,  for example 3,000 to  6,000.  It  will  be understood that  compositions comprising semi-solid and waxy PEGS may  not be amenable to  injection,  and will  accordingly  be  implanted by alternative means.   In certain embodiments, the drug Substance is dissolved in  the polyethylene glycol, while in other embodiments the  drug substance is dispersed or suspended in the PEG in the  form of solid particles. In yet other embodiments, the drug  Substance may be encapsulated or otherwise incorporated  into  particles,  such as  microspheres,  nanospheres,  lipo  Somes, lipospheres, micelles, and the like,  or it  may be  conjugated to a polymeric carrier. Any such particles are  preferably less than about 500 microns in diameter, more  preferably less than about 150 microns.   The present invention also provides for macroscopic drug  delivery devices, for example in the form of hollow par  ticles,  capsules or open tubes,  which contain an in situ  gelling composition of the invention. The devices may be  permeable to the drug Substance, or they may be imperme  able with one or more openings through which the drug  substance may exit the device. Such devices, which are  well-known in the art, provide additional control over the  release rate of the drug substance, by controlling the diffu  sion rate and/or Surface area through which the drug Sub  stance is released.   The drug Substance in certain embodiments is a peptide or  protein, which optionally may be pegylated, while in other  embodiments the drug Substance is a prodrug or a co-drug.  The drug Substance may be in the form of a salt, which may  be a low-solubility salt. In certain embodiments exemplified  herein, the drug Substance is the diclofenate ester of mor  phine.   The compositions of the invention may optionally contain  additives, such as pore-forming agents (e.g., Sugars, salts,  and water-soluble polymers) and release rate modifiers (e.g.,  sterols, fatty acids, glycerol esters, and the like).   In another aspect, the invention provides a method for  administering a drug Substance to a Subject, which com  prises injecting into the Subject a composition comprising  (a) a drug Substance; (b) a liquid PEG, and (c) a biocom  patible and bioerodable PLGA polymer that is dissolved in   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   6  the PEG. As used herein, \u201csubject\u201d refers to both human and  animal patients to whom the drug is to be administered.   In yet another aspect, the invention provides a method for  forming a polymeric Sustained-release drug delivery gel in a  Subject, which comprises injecting into the Subject a com  position comprising (a) a drug Substance; (b) a liquid PEG,  and (c) a biocompatible and bioerodable PLGA polymer that  is dissolved in the polyethylene glycol.   The present invention also provides for the co-adminis  tration of a PEG/polymer/drug fluid with an aqueous fluid,  which may be for example normal saline or a hydrogel. In  this embodiment, the two fluids are either administered at  the same time via a double lumen needle, or mixed imme  diately before administration. The two fluids  may be in  contained in attached Syringes. Co-administration reduces  the local irritation that may be caused by direct application  of highly concentrated PEGs.   The polymer may be any biocompatible PLGA polymer  that is soluble in or miscible with PEG, and is less soluble  in water. It is preferably water-insoluble, and is preferably a  bioerodable polymer. The carboxyl termini of the lactide  and  glycolide-containing  polymer  may  optionally  be  capped, e.g., by esterification, and the hydroxyl termini may  optionally be capped, e.g., by etherification or esterification.  Preferably the polymer is PLGA having a lactide:glycolide  molar ratio of between 20:80 and 90:10, more preferably  between 50:50 and 85:15.   Bioerodable  polymers  are  polymers  which  gradually  degrade to Smaller chemical fragments when placed in the  subject\u2019s  body.  Two types  of degradable polymers  are  included  under  this  definition:  biodegradable  polymers  (whose biodegradation is enzymatically mediated) and bio  absorbable polymers (which degrade to Smaller fragments in  the presence of water and/or other chemical species in the  body). Some bioerodable polymers, e.g., certain block co  polymers, may be subject to both modes of degradation.   Biocompatible polymers are those polymers which, when  injected or implanted in the Subject\u2019s body, do not cause  inflammation or irritation, do not induce an immune reac  tion, and do not exhibit toxicity.   The in situ gelling compositions of the present invention  are suitable for delivering Small organic molecules as well as  peptides, proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids. The  drug Substance may be a pharmaceutically active Substance,  a pro-drug that is converted in vivo into a pharmaceutically  active Substance, or a co-drug that is converted in vivo into  two or more pharmaceutically active Substances. By co-drug  is meant a combination of two or more drugs whose mol  ecules are physically linked, for example by covalent or  ionic bonds. Examples of Suitable co-drugs are described in  U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/134,033 (publication US  2003/0039689) and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/349,  202, which are incorporated herein by reference. The drug  substance may be soluble or insoluble in PEG.

The polyethylene glycol solvent may be a PEG that is  liquid at room temperature and ambient pressure, having an  average MW of between about 100 and about 600, prefer  ably between about 200 and about 400. Alternatively it may  be a semi-solid or wax PEG, having an average molecular  weight up to about 6,000. The ratio of polyethylene glycol  to polymer will typically range from about 25:1 to about  1:20 by weight.   The compositions of the invention can be used to maintain  therapeutically effective systemic levels of suitably potent  drugs that have an appropriate elimination rate. The inven  tion can also be used to maintain therapeutically effective  localized levels of Suitably potent drugs having appropriate  clearance rates.   The compositions of the invention may be prepared by  stirring PEG, the drug Substance, and polymer together until  solution  is  obtained.  Dissolution  may be accelerated by  heating and agitation.  Where the drug Substance is  not  soluble in the PEG, the drug substance is preferably pro  vided in the form of a microparticulate or nanoparticulate  powder that will form a suspension in the polymer-PEG  Solution.   In certain embodiments, the drug Substance may be cova  lently linked to a polyoxyethylene ether (e.g., PEG), wherein  the covalent bonds are cleavable in vivo so as to release the  drug Substance. In certain embodiments, the drug Substance  is  released  in  a Sustained  manner.  Methods  shown  for  forming and applying conjugate prodrugs (e.g., PEG-drug  conjugates) are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,681.964 and in U.S.  Provisional Application No. 60/539.306, the specifications  of which are incorporated by reference in  their entirety  herein.   In certain embodiments, the drug Substance is a pegylated   prodrug of another drug Substance.   In  certain  embodiments  the  drug  Substance  may be   included in compounds having structure 1  below:   wherein A is a residue of a pharmaceutically active agent A,  L represents a covalent bond or a linker moiety, and S is a  polyoxyethylene  ether  group  having  the  formula  \u2014(OCH2CH2)OR, where p is 2-12 and R is a C-C alkyl  group. The biocompatible fluid may comprise a mixture of  compounds having a range of values of p; but in preferred  embodiments p has a single  value and the composition  comprises only one compound of structure 1. The bond or  linker L is cleavable in vivo So as to release the active agent  A'. The agent A will typically feature one or more functional  groups to which linkers L can be readily attached. Examples   \fUS 9,566,336 B2   10  cleaved,  with  or  without enzymatic  catalysis,  so  as  to  generate in situ the active drug Substance.   Examples of suitable linkers include, but are not limited   of Such functional groups include but are not limited to  \u2014COH, -CONH,  CHO, =O,  OH, -NH, and  \u2014SH groups.   Examples of bonds and linkages which are cleavable in  vivo, either by hydrolysis or by enzyme catalysis, include  but are not limited to esters, amities, carbamates, carbonates,  orthoesters,  cyclic  ketals,  thioesters, thioamides, thiocar  bamates, thiocarbonates, Xanthates,  disulfides,  and phos  phate esters.

No. 6,127,355, Ulbrich et al.,  Makromol. Chem. 1986; 187:1131-1144, Conover et al., and  Anti-Cancer Drug Design 1999; 14:499-506, and in many of  the references cited therein, and the use of such linkers is  specifically contemplated. Ester linkages may also be used  (see R. Bronaugh et al., Percutaneous Absorption 3rd Ed., p.  58-63,  R. L.  Bronaugh and H. I.  Maibach, eds.,  Marcel  Dekker, New York, 1999).   The values of m and n will typically range front 1 to 4,  although larger values are within the scope of the invention.  Typically, the linker is divalent and m and n will have the  same value, but multiple links to a single moiety S, as for  example in a ketal or orthoester linkage, may be employed.  Alternatively, multiple moieties S may be appended via a  single linker L, for example by esterification of the agent A  with a moiety such as  C(=O)CHI(OCH2CH)OR), or  -  P(=O)(OCHCH.)OR). Where m>1 and/or n>1, each  incidence of L and S may be the same or different.

Topical and Ocular Drug Delivery, 1992, K. B. Sloan (Ed.),  Drugs and the Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol 53 (Marcel  Dekker). It will be appreciated that the rate of cleavage will  vary depending on the precise structures of the active agent  and the polyoxyethylene ether, and on the nature of the  linker or bond L and the point(s) of attachment. The effi  ciency  of prodrug  cleavage  of linkers  for any  specific  embodiment can be readily determined by those of skill in  the art; for a review of methods see A. Stichcomb, 2003,  Pharm Res. 20:1113-1118.   The linker or bond L. may be attached to any suitable  heteroatom present in the topically active agent that carries  an exchangeable hydrogen, such as \u2014OH, SH, NH, and  COOH groups. By way of example, the free hydroxyl group  of triamcinolone acetonide may be acylated with the moiety  \u2014C(=O)(OCHCH)OR.  In one embodiment, the active drug Substance comprises  a carboxylic acid group, and the carboxylic acid group is  esterified  with  a  polyoxyethylene  ether  of  formula  HO(CHCHO).R. Examples include but are not limited to  structures I,  II, and III shown below:   I   II   O   (OCH2CH2)OCH3   (OCH2CH)OCH,   O   F   55       III   C   MeO   (OCH2CH2)OCH3   \fUS 9,566,336 B2   11  In an alternative embodiment, the active drug Substance  comprises a hydroxyl group, and the hydroxyl group is  acylated with a polyoxyethylene ether carbonyl moiety of  formula  CO(OCH2CH2)OR. Examples include but are  not limited to structures IV and V shown below:   12  group on a polyoxyethylene ether residue, which itself is  formed by removal of a hydrogen atom from a hydroxyl  group from the polyoxyethylene ether. In this sense, the term  \u201cresidue' as used herein is analogous to the sense of the  word as it is used in peptide and protein chemistry to refer  to a residue of an amino acid in a peptide.   The terms \u201clinker  and \u201clinkage,\u201d which are used inter  changeably herein, refer to a direct bond or to a multivalent  group of atoms incorporating and connecting the functional  groups of the active drug Substance and a polyoxyethylene  ether, which is metabolized under physiological conditions  to release the active agent A'. In certain embodiments, the  linker is a Substantially linear moiety having no more than  25 atoms, more preferably less  than  10 atoms. Preferred  linkers are ones which, upon release of the topically active  agent, and when further metabolized, generate byproducts  that are non-toxic and inert at the effective dosing concen  tration. Direct bonds between the residue A and the poly  oxyethylene moiety S are particularly preferred.   5   10   15   EXAMPLES   Example 1   Evaluation of Solubility of PLGA in Organic  Solvents   A sample of PLGA polymer was added to the indicated  Solvent and overnight at room temperature, and the resulting  mixture was examined for undissolved material.

The rate of gelation depended on the identity of  the solvent, the ratio of solvent to polymer, and the lactide/  glycolate ratio of the polymer.   Example 2   Release Profiles for Morphine-Diclofenac Co-Drug  from PLGA (70:30)/PEG Formulations   Three formulations were evaluated to compare release  profiles for morphine-diclofenac co-drug from different con  centrations of PLGA (70:30): Formulation A was formulated  at about 10 mg/ml morphine-diclofenac co-drug in PLGA  (70:30)/PEG 400 solution  (-5% (w/v) PLGA in  PEG).  Formulation B was formulated at about 10 mg/ml morphine   IV   O X-ocietyoch,   O   II IO           O   O   O   chochscho-K   N   NH  (  is  Sulu  4.  N   V   25   In certain embodiments, the biocompatible fluid includes  a prodrug comprising a pharmaceutical compound linked to  a  polyoxyethylene  ether  moiety  of  the  formula:  \u2014(OCH2CH2)OR, wherein p=2-12 and R is a C-C alkyl  group. In certain embodiments, n is an integer from 2 to 6  inclusive. The identities of the group R may be methyl,  ethyl, or any other organic moiety.   In certain embodiments, the use of prodrug linkages in  connection with a drug Substance may improve the solubility  of an agent in water or in polymer. For example, the use of  a pegylated prodrug may improve the solubility of an agent  in the biocompatible fluid, and thereby improve the inject  ability of the invention. The use of prodrug linkages may  also lower the melting point of a Solid drug Substance, or  increase the solubility of a drug Substance in physiological  fluids, thereby improving the injectability of the drug sub  Stance.   The drug Substance may be dissolved, dispersed or Sus  pended in the biocompatible core, whereupon it may leach  out of the core and into Surrounding fluid. In certain embodi  ments, the drug Substance may rapidly  escape from an  injection mixture after injection into a physiological system.  The term \u201cresidue' when applied to an agent means a part  of an agent that is Substantially identical to the agent from  which it is derived, with minor differences arising by virtue  of having one or more atoms removed to provide points of  attachment for the linker(s) L. Typically, at least one func  tional group of the residue will be altered (relative to the  parent pharmaceutically active agent) to accommodate the  covalent linker. This will typically involve removal of an  exchangeable hydrogen and/or a single heteroatom, leaving  a free Valence for attachment of the linkage L. For instance,  where the drug Substance includes a carboxylate functional  group, the residue of the agent formed by removal of a  hydroxyl group may form an ester bond with a hydroxyl   40   45   50   55   60   65   \fUS 9,566,336 B2   13  diclofenac  co-drug in  PLGA (70:30)/PEG  400 solution  (-10% (w/v) PLGA in PEG). Formulation C was formulated  at about 10 mg/ml morphine-diclofenac co-drug in PLGA  (70:30)/PEG 400 solution (-20% (w/v) PLGA in PEG).   Each formulation was loaded into a 1-ml syringe, and 100  ul aliquot was injected into a tube containing 10 ml of 10%  plasma in HA (hyaluronic acid) phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.  The samples were placed in a water bath at 37\u00b0C. for release  study. At each time point, the entire release medium was  removed and replaced with 10 ml fresh buffer. The removed  Solution  was analyzed for morphine, diclofenac and the  co-drug contents by HPLC.   The results are shown graphically in FIG. 1. Morphine  released much faster from the formulation A with 5% (w/v)  PLGA. At day 18 about 80% morphine released. The release  profiles of formulations B and C were very similar. At day  24 about 80% of the  morphine was released from both  formulations. However, the higher concentration of PLGA at  20% (w/v) reduced initial burst significantly.   No morphine-diclofenac co-drug was detected since the  co-drug was hydrolyzed in the release medium. Diclofenac  data (not shown) was not reliable, due to the high protein  binding of diclofenac in the serum medium.   Example 3   Release Rate Profile for Morphine-Diclofenac  Co-Drug from PLGA (50:50)/PEG Formulation   The formulation was prepared with 12 mg/ml morphine  diclofenac  co-drug in  PLGA (50:50)/PEG  400 solution  (-5% (w/v) PLGA in PEG) and loaded into a 1-ml syringe,  and 100 ul aliquot was injected into a test tube containing 10  ml of 10% plasma in HA (hyaluronic acid) phosphate buffer,  pH 7.4. The samples were placed in a 37\u00b0C. water bath. At  each time point, the entire release medium was removed and  replaced with  10 ml fresh buffer. The removed solutions  were analyzed for morphine, diclofenac and the co-drug  contents by HPLC.   The results are shown graphically in FIG. 2. As compared  to the results from Example 2, morphine release was much  slower in this PLGA (50:50) formulation, even where the  PLGA concentration was low as ~5% (w/v). About 80% of  the morphine was released over 40 days. It is most likely that  the higher molecular weight of PLGA (50:50) reduces the  release rate of morphine.   Example 4   Release Profiles for Morphine-Diclofenac Co-Drug  from PLGA (70:30) with Non-Polymeric Solvents   Two formulations were evaluated for this study: Formu  lation A was formulated at about 8 mg/ml morphine-di  clofenac  co-drug in  PLGA (70:30)/DMA solution  (40%  (w/v) PLGA in DMA). Formulation B was formulated at  about  10 mg/ml morphine-diclofenac co-drug  in  PLGA  (70:30)/benzyl benzoate solution (20% (w/v) PLGA in ben  Zyl benzoate).   Each formulation was loaded into a 1-ml syringe, and 100  ul aliquot was injected into a tube containing 10 ml of 10%  plasma in HA (hyaluronic acid) phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.   14  The samples were placed in a water bath at 37\u00b0C. for release  study. At each time point, the entire release medium for the  DMA formulation was removed and replaced with 10 ml  fresh buffer, while only 5 ml release medium for the benzyl  benzoate formulation was removed and replaced with 5 ml  fresh  buffer.  The removed solutions  were analyzed for  morphine, diclofenac and the co-drug contents by HPLC.  The results are shown in FIGS. 3 (DMA) and 4 (benzyl  benzoate). The morphine release profile from the DMA  formulation is very similar to that from the formulation with  5% (w/v) PLGA in Example 2, although the concentration of  PLGA in the DMA formulation was 40% (w/v). However,  morphine release was slower in the benzyl benzoate formu  lation. At day 35 about 46% morphine was released. DMA  is more hydrophilic than benzyl benzoate, which is an oily  solvent. By adding these organic solvent(s) to PLGA for  mulations, drug release rate can be adjusted.

( 57 )  ABSTRACT  Embodiments of the invention provide swallowable devices ,  preparations  and methods for delivering drugs and other  therapeutic agents within the GI tract . Many embodiments  provide a  swallowable device for delivering the  agents .  Particular embodiments provide a  swallowable device such  as a  capsule for delivering drugs into the intestinal wall or  other GI lumen .  Embodiments also  provide various drug  preparations that are  configured to be contained within the  capsule , advanced  from  the capsule into the intestinal wall  and degrade to  release  the drug  into  the bloodstream  to  produce a  therapeutic effect . The preparation  can be oper  ably coupled to delivery means having a  first configuration  where the preparation  is  contained  in  the capsule and  a  second configuration where the preparation is advanced out  of the capsule into  the intestinal wall . Embodiments of the  invention  are particularly  useful for the delivery of drugs  which are poorly absorbed , tolerated and / or degraded within  the GI tract .   22 Claims , 46 Drawing Sheets   \f( 56 )   References Cited  U .

ABSTRACT  ( 57 )  Embodiments of the invention provide swallowable devices ,  preparations and methods for  delivering  drugs and other  therapeutic agents within  the GI tract . Many embodiments  provide  a  swallowable  device  for delivering the agents .  Particular embodiments provide a  swallowable device such  as a  capsule for delivering drugs into the intestinal wall or  other GI lumen .  Embodiments also  provide  various  drug  preparations that are  configured to  be contained within  the  capsule ,  advanced from  the capsule  into  the intestinal wall  and  degrade to  release  the drug into  the bloodstream  to  produce a  therapeutic  effect .  The preparation  can be oper  ably  coupled to  delivery means having a  first configuration  where the preparation  is  contained  in  the  capsule  and  a  second configuration where the preparation is  advanced out  of the capsule into the intestinal wall . Embodiments of the  invention  are particularly  useful for the delivery  of drugs  which are poorly absorbed , tolerated and / or degraded within  the GI tract .   20 Claims , 46 Drawing Sheets   \f( 56 )   / 2004  Prausnitz  et al .

It will be appreciated that the rate of cleavage will  vary depending on the precise structures of the active agent  and the polyoxyethylene  ether ,  and on  the nature of the  10  linker or bond L  and the point ( s ) of attachment .  The effi  ciency  of  prodrug  cleavage of linkers  for  any  specific  embodiment can be readily  determined by those of skill in  the art ;  for  a  review  of methods see  A .

In  certain  embodiments , the use of prodrug linkages in  connection with  an  agent may improve the solubility of an  40  agent in  water or in  polymer . For example , the use of a  pegylated prodrug may improve the solubility of an  agent in  the biocompatible fluid , and thereby improve the injectabil  ity of the invention . The use of prodrug linkages may also  lower the melting point of a  solid  agent , or increase  the  45  solubility  of an  agent  in  physiological  fluids ,  thereby  The agent may be dissolved , dispersed or suspended in  the  biocompatible core , whereupon it may leach out of the core  and  into  surrounding  fluid .

In  certain embodiments the inner core is a viscous paste  containing at least 10 %  agent , or preferably over 50 %  agent  or , more preferably , over 75 %  agent .  In certain embodiments , the polymer system  is injected or  inserted  into  a  physiological system  ( e . g . , a patient ) . Upon  60  injection or insertion , the delivery system  will contact water  or  other immediately  surrounding physiological fluid  that  will enter the polymer system  and contact the inner core . In  certain  embodiments , the core materials may be selected so  as to create a matrix that reduces ( and thereby allows control  65  of ) the rate of release of the agent from  the delivery system .

The preparation can be oper  ably  coupled to  delivery means having a  first configuration  where the preparation  is  contained  in  the  capsule and a  second configuration where the preparation  is  advanced out  of the  capsule into  the intestinal wall . Embodiments of the  invention  are particularly  useful for the delivery  of drugs  which are poorly absorbed , tolerated and / or degraded within  the GI tract .   27  Claims , 46 Drawing Sheets   ( 54 )  THERAPEUTIC AGENT PREPARATIONS  FOR DELIVERY INTO  A  LUMEN OF THE  INTESTINAL TRACT USING  A  SWALLOWABLE DRUG DELIVERY DEVICE   ( 71 )  Applicant : Rani Therapeutics , LLC , San  Jose ,   CA ( US )   ( 72 )  Inventor :  Mir Imran , Los Altos Hills , CA ( US )  ( 73 )  Assignee :  Rani Therapeutics , LLC , San Jose ,   ( * )  Notice :   CA ( US )  Subject to any disclaimer , the term  of this  patent is  extended or adjusted under 35  U .

The device  includes a control and display unit, a two-part dispensing  mechanism, a drug reservoir, an administration element, and  a solvent removal element. The dispensing mechanism may  be a peristaltic pump having an active portion with a motor,  a roller, a mounting plate and a detachable passive portion  with tubing and a housing. The motor and roller are mounted  in the reusable portion of the delivery device with the control  unit and a power source. The speed of the micromotor is  controlled by the control unit, so that the turning speed of the  roller is controlled which, in turn, controls the flow rate to  the administration. The passive portion and drug reservoir  are detachable along with the administration element for  attaching a new dosing reservoir.   48 Claims, 20 Drawing Sheets   7--   90   ISPLAY   KEYBOAR   93   f   40           ADMINISTRATION RESERWOR  MEMBRANE       M5, 152,   %   O   \fUS RE46,217 E  Page 2   (56)   References Cited   U.S. PATENT DOCUMENTS   2/1995  Alliger  2f1995  Castro  4/1995  D\u2019Angelo et al.  5/1995  Henley  9, 1995  Cormier et al.   3/1990  Govil et al.  4, 1990  Heiber et al.  4, 1990  Lee et al.  3, 1991  Amkraut et al.  5, 1991  Sibalis  9, 1991  Amkraut   4,708,716 A  11, 1987  Sibalis  4.885,154.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED  APPLICATIONS   10   15   This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional  Application No. 60/594.981 filed May 24, 2005 and U.S.  Provisional Application No. 60/720,076 filed Sep. 24, 2005,  both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their  entirety.   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION   40   30   25   1. Field of the Invention  The present invention relates to a device for controllable  dispensing of active Substance, such as a chemical Sub  stance, a medication, a drug, or the like, to a person or other  mammal, and more particularly, the invention is related to a  portable device usable for transdermal and subcutaneous  drug delivery or compound delivery in a programmable,  automated, and/or controllable manner including control of  the dose and timing of delivery to the patient. The invention  further relates  to  the controllable stopping of compound  delivery to the body. The invention further relates to the field  35  of chronobiology  in  that  the  invention  systems  can be  designed to modulate active agent delivery in accordance  with biological rhythms pursuant to automated and/or pre  programmed dosage profiles. Bioactive substances are deliv  ered transdermally into a body in a manner that is synchro  nized with biological processes and/or biological rhythms,  and/or narcotic or other addiction cycles or other intra body  or externally desired cycles So as to improve performance of  the substance in the body or otherwise achieve a desired  result  by  controlling  blood plasma concentrations  of a 45  compound. The invention also relates to overcoming active  agent tolerance, which may be experienced from continuous  administration,  overcoming active  agent  skin  irritation,  which may be experienced from continuous administration  by allowing skin rest periods, improve patient compliance,  50  and in some cases reducing the amount of drug needed per  dose  due to  advantages  of biosynchronization  or  pro  grammed dosing. A programmable heating element may also  be utilized to automatically heat the skin at precise times or  intervals to assist in permeation and/or aid in the stopping of 55  dosing.   2. Relevant Background  Medications provide effective treatments for a variety of  illnesses. It is often preferred that medication is applied at a  certain time or with a certain time pattern and in a manner 60  that keeps the concentration of medication at a certain value  to achieve a desired therapeutic result most efficiently. There  are some medications that are only able to release effective  pharmaceutical Substances over a long period of time. Fur  ther, there are effective substances that are partially or totally  65  inactivated following oral  ingestion by the highly acidic  environment of the stomach or by the filter impact of the   2  liver. In order to overcome such problems, drugs are admin  istered by either by transdermal delivery through the skin  (e.g.,  with a patch)  or Subcutaneously with a needle or  continuously by drip, with these later two methods being  common parenteral methods for drug delivery. For a long  term treatment, the parenteral methods may be uncomfort  able for the patient because of the repeated injury by needle  injections and the limited liberty of action due to intravenous  drip apparatus.   Patches are a form of transdermal drug delivery that is  applied on the Surface of the skin. These patches are cap  turing more and more attention in recent years because they  are portable, comfortable, and suitable for patients with drug  delivery in continuous dosages over a relatively long period  of time without requiring active participation of the patient.  In the last decade, portable dispensing systems have been  developed to provide a more flexible, precise and complex  administration of drugs. Generally, the dispensing systems  comprise a reservoir for a drug, a dispensing unit, and a  patch  (or a membrane that  is  permeable  to  the  active  substance, drug, or the like but relatively impermeable to a  solvent  in  which  the  active  substance  is  mixed in  the  reservoir).  The reservoir through  the  dispensing unit  is  interconnected to the patch. The dispensing unit controls the  releasing of the drug in the reservoir to  the patch. The  efficiency  for  patch  transdermal  drug  delivery  depends  mainly on the diffusion  rate  of the effective substances  through the skin. Maintenance of the concentration of the  effective substances on the patch is essential to achieve the  desirable diffusion rate. However, it has proven problematic  to effectively control the concentration of substances on the  patch in an effective manner. Further, it has proven difficult  to provide an inexpensive portable device that allows a user  or patient to  easily  refill  the  reservoir and to  otherwise  maintain the device.   In the field of drug delivery, it is recognized that Supply  ing the drug in a correct temporal pattern is an important  attribute  of any drug  delivery  methodology.  Controlled  release drug delivery systems are intended to improve the  response to a drug and/or lessen side effects of a drug. The  recurring interest in chronopharmacology demonstrates the  fact that  biological  rhythms are an important aspect  of  clinical pharmacology and should be taken into account  when evaluating drug delivery systems (Hrushesky, W., J.  Cont. Rel. 19:363 (1992), Lemmer, B., Adv. Drug Del. Rev.  6:19 (1991), Youn, C. B. J. Cont. Rel. 98 (3) 337 (2004) and  Youn, C. B. J. Ed., \u201cChronopharmaceutics,\u201d John Wiley &  Sons, New York.   The onset and symptoms of diseases such as asthma  attacks,  coronary  infarction,  angina pectoris,  stroke and  Ventricular tachycardia are circadian phase dependent. In  addition, certain addictions (such as cigarette Smoking) have  times of day based on a persons circadian rhythms when  symptoms peak. In humans, variations during the 24 h day  in pharmacokinetics (chrono-pharmacokinetics) have been  shown for cardiovascular active drugs (propranolol, nife  dipine, Verapamil, enalapril, isosorbide 5-mononitrate and  digoxin),  anti-asthmatics  (theophylline  and terbutaline),  anti-cancer drugs, psychotropics, analgesics, local anesthet  ics and antibiotics, to mention but a few. Even more drugs  have been shown to display significant variations in their  effects throughout the day (chronopharmacodynamics and  chronotoxicology) even after chronic application or constant  infusion (Ohdo, S. Drug Safety 26 (14) 999-1010 (2003)).  Moreover, there is clear evidence that dosef concentration  response relationships can be significantly modified based  on the time of day. Thus, circadian time has to be taken into   \fUS RE46,217 E   3  account as an important variable influencing a drug's phar  macokinetics and its effects or side-effects (Bruguerolle, B.,  Clin. Pharmacokinet. August 35 (2) 83-94 (1998)).   Studies indicate that the onset of certain diseases show  strong circadian temporal dependency. This has led to the  need for timed patterning of drug delivery as opposed to  constant drug release (Lemmer B., Ciba Found Symp. 183:  235-47; discussion 247-53 (1995). The term \u201ccontrolled  release' refers generally to delivery mechanisms that make  an active ingredient available to the biological system of a  host in a manner that Supplies the drug according to a desired  temporal pattern. Controlled release drug delivery systems  may be implemented using: a) instantaneous release sys  tems; b) delayed release systems, and c) sustained release  systems.  In  most cases,  controlled  release  systems  are  designed to maintain a Sustained plasma level of an active  ingredient in a drug within a human or animal host over a  period of time.   Instantaneous release refers  to  systems that  make the  active ingredient available immediately after administration  to the biosystem of the host. Instantaneous release systems  include continuous or pulsed intravenous infusion or injec  tions. Such systems provide a great deal of control because  administration  can  be both  instantaneously  started  and  stopped and the delivery rate can be controlled with great  precision. However, the administration is undesirably inva  sive as they involve administration via a puncture needle or  catheter.   Delayed release refers to systems in which the active  ingredient made available to the host at Some time after  administration. Such systems include oral as well as inject  able  drugs  in  which the active  ingredient  is  coated or  en-capsulated with a Substance that dissolves at a known rate  so as to release the active ingredient after the delay. Unfor  tunately, it is often difficult to control the degradation of the  coating or encapsulant after administration and the actual  performance will vary from patient to patient.   Sustained Release generally refers to  release of active  ingredient such that the level of active ingredient available  to the host is maintained at some level over a period of time.  Like delayed release systems, Sustained release systems are  difficult to control and exhibit variability from patient to  patient. Due to the adsorption through the gastrointestinal  tract, drug concentrations rise quickly in the body when  taking a pill, but the decrease is dependent on excretion and  metabolism, which cannot be controlled. In addition, the  adsorption through the gastrointestinal tract in many cases  leads to considerable side effects (such as ulcers), and can  severely damage the liver.   Transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) have been devel  oped primarily for Sustained release of drugs in situations  where oral Sustained release systems are inadequate. In some  cases,  drugs  cannot  be  effectively  administered  orally  because the active ingredients are destroyed or altered by the  gastrointestinal  system.  In  other cases the drug may be  physically or chemically  incompatible with the coatings  and/or chelating agents used to implement Sustained release.  In other cases a transdermal delivery system may provide  Sustained release over a period of days or weeks whereas  orally administered drugs may offer Sustained performance  over only a few hours. A wide variety of active substances  can be delivered through transdermal systems so long as the  active Substance can be provided in a form that can cross the  skin barrier, see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,638,528, which  is incorporated herein by reference.   In most cases transdermal delivery systems are passive,  taking the form of a patch that is attached to the skin by an   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   4  adhesive. The TTS includes a quantity of the active sub  stance, along with a Suitable carrier if need be, in a reservoir,  matrix or in the adhesive itself.  Once applied, the active  ingredient diffuses through the skin at a rate determined by  the concentration of the active substance and the diffusivity  of the active substance. However, a variety of physical and  chemical processes at the skin/patch boundary affect the  delivery  rate  and  may eventually  inhibit  drug  delivery  altogether.   The original performance target for controlled drug deliv  ery is to achieve a Zero-order release rate of the drug, so that  a constant efficacious drug concentration is  maintained in  the blood plasma.  However, more than two decades of  research in chronobiology and chronopharmacology have  demonstrated the importance of biological rhythms to the  dosing of medications as well as determine the influence of  a patient's circadian or other biological rhythms on drug  efficacy and efficiency. This research reveals that certain  disease symptoms follow a daily pattern, with peak Symp  toms at certain times of the day. It has been widely acknowl  edged that hormones, neurotransmitters and other intra-body  compounds are released in different amounts at different  times of the day pursuant to daily patterns.   The new approach stems from a growing body of research  that demonstrates that certain diseases tend to get worse at  certain times of the day. Also, certain disease symptoms  have peak periods when cravings are at their highest. By  synchronizing  medications  with a patient\u2019s  body clock,  and/or addiction cycles, many physicians believe that the  drugs will work more effectively and with fewer side effects.  In some cases, the improvements have been so pronounced  that doctors have been able to reduce dosages. Circadian  physiologic processes have been found to alter drug absorp  tion, distribution,  metabolism, and excretion. As a result,  drug doses need to be adjusted to meet the differing needs of  target organs or tissues at various times of the day (see, L.  Lamberg, American Pharmacy, N831 (11): 20\u201323 (1991)).  The continued interest in chronopharmacology shows the  ever-increasing need to develop technologies to control the  temporal profile in drug delivery. Research findings Suggest  that the onset and severity of many diseases are cyclic in  nature, or follow circadian patterns. Addiction symptoms  also show cyclical nature. For example, cigarette Smokers  experience peak nicotine cravings upon waking, but nicotine  is  a stimulant, so there is  a clear advantage to have an  automated drug delivery system that can be programmed to  not release nicotine during the sleep cycle, but to release  nicotine prior to  waking, because this  would effectively  combat peak morning nicotine cravings while removing the  adverse side effect of sleep cycle nicotine disturbances. Drug  tolerance adds to the need for modulation of drug dosing  profiles. Additionally, skin irritation and sensitization caused  by medications may require intervals during which no drug  is administered. For example, fentanyl when administered  continuously without rest periods can cause severe skin  irritation, so there is a clear advantage of allowing the skin  a \u201crest period  when no fentanyl is delivered in order to  decrease adverse skin irritation and give the skin a chance to  recover. Therefore, this improved form of drug delivery will  be very  important to  people who need medicine easily,  painlessly and automatically delivered to their bodies in  timed increments (see Smolensk, M. H. & Lamberg, L.  Body Clock Guide to  Better  Health.  How to  Use Your  Body\u2019s Natural Clock to Fight Illness and Achieve Maxi  mum Health, Henry Holt & Company, New York (2001) and  Grimes, J. et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther 285 (2): 457-463  (1998)).   \fUS RE46,217 E   5  Active transdermal delivery systems have been developed  to help regulate the delivery rate by providing mechanisms  to improve drug delivery over time by \u201cpumping  the active  ingredient.  One such system, (U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,370.635),  describes a system for delivering a medicament and dis  pensing it to an organism for a relatively long period of time,  for example at least a few days. The device can be adapted  for positioning on the Surface of the skin of a human or  possibly an animal body in order to apply a medicament  thereto from the outer side thereof. Conventional transder  mal systems circumvent the disadvantages of the adsorption  through the gastrointestinal tract, but they do not optimize or  tailor  the  dosing regiment to  offset  peak symptoms.  In  addition the constant transdermal delivery of a drug can lead  to severe side effects, including debilitating sleep disorders  (if the drug is a stimulant) and ever increasing tolerance  (such as pain medications).   A simple type of transdermal chronotherapy is a biphasic  profile, in which the drug concentration changes from a high  to a low level (or vice versa) over time. Although the system  can be physically applied or removed to alter the drug level.  patient compliance with this procedure may be difficult,  particularly during inconvenient hours. To generate a bipha  sic  profile,  the delivery  system may utilize  an external  regulator,  as  described  in  Fallon  et  al.  (U.S.  Pat.  No.  5,352,456) which illustrates a device for drug administration  through intact skin that provides an initial pulse in the flux  of the drug through the skin followed by a substantially  lower flux of drug through the skin. Additionally, Fallon et  al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,820,875) later describe a device for the  administration of a drug through an area of intact skin over  a period of time in which the flux of the drug through the  skin varies temporally in a controlled manner; The device is  such that the skin flux of the drug varies in a controlled  manner over the period of administration, typically from a  high flux in the initial stage of administration to a lower flux  in the later stage of administration.   Transdermal temporally controlled drug delivery systems,  proposed by Giannos  et  al.  (U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,068,853)  coupled pH oscillators with membrane diffusion in order to  generate a periodic release of a drug or active ingredient  transdermally, without external power sources and/or elec  tronic controllers. The intent was to address chronotherapy  with a pulsatile transdermal system. The strategy was based  on the observation that a drug may be rendered charged or  uncharged  relative  to  its  pK  value.  Since  only  the  uncharged form of a drug can permeate across lipophilic  membranes, including the skin, a periodic delivery profile  may be obtained by oscillating the pH of the drug solution  (see Giannos,  S.  A.,  \u201cPulsatile  Delivery of Drugs and  Topical Actives.\u201d in \u201cNovel Topical Actives and Delivery  Systems: Cosmetics, Dermatologicals and Transdermals'.  Edited by John. J. Wille, Jr.: Blackwell Publishing, Oxford  UK (In press)).   Recently, an orally administered drug for arthritis treat  ment has suggested a chronotherapeutic approach using a  delay release system. The delay is scheduled to release the  active ingredient at the beginning of an interleukin 6 cascade  that is believed to cause early morning stiffness in rheuma  toid arthritis patients. By attempting to synchronize the drug  delivery with a biological cycle it is believed that low doses  may be used to achieve desired results. However, this system  does not overcome the limitations of delayed release sys  tems described above.   Although it  may possible to meet the requirements of  chronopharmacology with pills, this requires an enormous  amount of discipline by the patient  to  comply with the   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   6  treatment regiment, see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,214.  379, which is  incorporated herein by reference. As illus  trated earlier, to achieve optimal results, many patients may  need to wake up during the night to take their medication.  Hence, what is needed is a non-invasive, reliable means of  delivering drugs compounds in precisely timed and mea  Sured doses-without the inconvenience and hazard of injec  tion, yet with improved performance as compared to orally  delivered drugs.   Addressing patient compliance (taking the proper dosages  at the prescribed times) is another critical problem facing  caregivers and pharmaceutical firms alike. Studies show that  only about half of patients take medications at the times and  in the dosages directed by their physician. It is reported that  each year, 125,000 deaths and up to 20% of all hospital and  nursing home admissions result from patient noncompli  ance. It  is estimated that non-compliance results in addi  tional healthcare costs in excess of S100 billion per year in  United States. These figures are even more pronounced for  the elderly.   An individual\u2019s failure to comply with a dosing regimen,  e.g. failure to take one or more doses of a drug or taking too  many doses, will have an adverse impact upon the Success  of the regimen. Individuals may fail to comply with their  drug dosing regimen for a number of reasons. For example,  drug dosing regimens, such as every 4 hours, e.g., 8, 12, 4,  8, 12, and 4 and the like, involve a rigid dosing schedule that  may be incompatible with an individuals personal schedule.  Such a rigid dosing schedule when combined with normal  human traits such as forgetfulness or denial of a medical  condition,  as  well  as  a busy life,  represent  Substantial  obstacles  to  compliance  with  a  drug  dosing  regimen.  Accordingly, Such rigid dosing regimens often result in the  failure by an individual to take one or more doses at the  prescribed time. This has an adverse impact on the levels of  the therapeutic Substance at the active site and consequently  on the overall efficacy of the therapeutic substance.   Hence,  a  need  exists  for  systems  and  methods  that  increase patient compliance for administration of a variety  of drugs.  Also,  there  remains  a  need for an improved  patch-based (or membrane-based) delivery system for an  active substance that is able to administrate the delivery of  a chemical Substance to a Subject over a period of time in a  controllable way. It  is a preferable for such a system or  device to administrate the delivery of a chemical substance  in a pulsatile and Scheduled manner, pursuant to  a pre  programmed  dosage  delivery  regimen,  meaning dosage  sizes and times can be automatically varied according to  Such pre-programming.   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   Embodiments of the present invention provide a patch/  drug reservoir-based transdermal delivery device to admin  istrate the delivery of an effective substance to a patch or  other drug reservoir adjacent to the membrane or in close  proximity to the skin for transdermal absorption that absorbs  or is filled with the substance (the administration reservoir)  over a period of time or from time to time in a controllable  and/or automated and programmable way.  Significantly,  these transdermal delivery devices include a reusable, active  portion that includes a control and display unit and an active  dispensing mechanism, e.g., a micropump that is in some  embodiments a specially  configured peristaltic  pump, a  pressurized reservoir, or other actuator. Further, the trans  dermal delivery devices include a detachable and disposable  passive portion that includes a drug reservoir that is sepa   \fUS RE46,217 E   7  rated from the administration reservoir and holds the drug  until the micropump or other actuator places the drug into  the administration reservoir for transdermal absorption and  a coupling mechanism/assembly for mating with the active  dispensing  mechanism, e.g.,  when the active dispensing  mechanism is a peristaltic pump the coupling mechanism  may include one or more elongate feed chambers (e.g.,  flexible tubes) that are connected to the drug reservoir and,  in many cases, to the administration reservoir adjacent the  membrane or skin or other material in contact with the skin.  The coupling mechanism may be defined in part by the outer  Surfaces of a housing for the passive portion, and these  Surfaces may include grooves or guides for receiving and  Supporting the active dispensing mechanism. In some cases,  the outer Surfaces of the housing define an arcuate surface  upon which the feed chamber or tube is disposed such that  the shoes or other portions of the peristaltic  pump can  compress the tube to  move liquid  from the dispensing  reservoir  to  the  administration  reservoir  near the  semi  permeable membrane or patch.   In  addition,  in  the  context  of automated transdermal  pulsatile drug delivery, starting dosing or bringing the active  compound into contact with the skin may be only one part  of the necessary methodology. The other part of the meth  odology may be to stop dosing or to stop permeation of the  active compound through the skin. Stopping dosing auto  matically is extremely useful in certain situations to start and  stop dosing so as to achieve programmed pulsatile drug  delivery. The present invention not only has initial dosing or  delivering methodologies, but also methodologies to stop  dosing or permeation so as to deliver and stop delivering  compounds to the body in a controlled and/or automated  and/or programmable manner.   More specifically,  in  certain  embodiments  where the  stop-page of permeation or dosing is desired, the active drug  formulation or solvent is removed from the administration  reservoir to stop dosing and/or decrease or end drug perme  ation through the skin. In this embodiment, a drug and/or  Solvent removal means is introduced (solvent/drug removal  means). In this situation, either the above mentioned micro  pump or actuator (which may move gas or air) or a second  micropump or actuator (which may move gas or air) will act  to  remove, and/or flush  the active  drug formulation  or  residual drug formulation/and or solvent from the adminis  tration reservoir into either into a waste reservoir or other  area for evaporation or other removal. The first or second  micropump or actuator, as applicable, may flush the admin  istration reservoir with air, gas, inactive solution and/or a  combination of these.   It is important to note that such an administration reser  voir acts as the administration depot for the transdermal  absorption and has a side (or a series of holes or openings or  otherwise) that allows the drug formulation to come into  contact with the skin for transdermal absorption, either by  passing through a membrane in contact with the skin or  otherwise to reach the skin for transdermal absorption. Such  administration reservoir may take many forms, such as a  Substrate including a plurality of micro-passageways for the  drug formulation; a Substrate made up of micro-structured  and/or micro-fabricated reservoirs; a substrate with a series  of miniaturized or micro-structured reservoirs, a substrate  including a plurality of ducts, culverts, and/or canals that  may take any size, shape, or configuration and which may be  micro-fabricated through any number of techniques includ  ing etching. This administration reservoir in whatever form  it may take may be filled using a micro-pump or other type  of actuator to allow for the transdermal absorption. The   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   8  reservoir may then be flushed or emptied, so as to stop or  slow drug delivery by removing the active drug from a  position where it can access the skin for transdermal absorp  tion. Aheating element may also be present whether directly  formed in the substrate forming the administration reservoir  or as a separate component of the drug reservoir either at the  top, bottom, or side of the drug reservoir.  This heating  element serves  to  increase  the  temperature  of the  skin  Surface which increases the permeation of the active com  pound through the skin. This heating element aids in the  movement of liquids through the passageways, if applicable,  including the administration reservoir. The heating element  may also aid in the evaporation of the drug formulation  where evaporation is a desired method to dry the adminis  tration area to  stop dosing by causing evaporation. This  heating element may be programmed to automatically heat  the skin at precise preprogrammed times for precise timing  of permeation enhancement and/or precise timing of stop  ping of dosing by inducing evaporation. The heating element  may be configured with a plurality of flow paths for vapor  or evaporated portions of the liquid (Such as solvent vapor)  that facilitates relatively uniform or at least well distributed  flow away from the reservoir.   A further embodiment that requires the stopping of dosing  induces evaporation of the drug formulation or more spe  cifically, the solvent, from the administration reservoir so as  to dry the administration reservoir which will result in the  stopping  of dosing.  A dry  skin/administration  reservoir  interface is not conducive to transdermal permeation. In this  embodiment, the administration reservoir has vents or other  accesses either to the environment for evaporation or imme  diate access by being in close proximity to a chamber(s)  containing  a desiccant.  This  desiccant  chamber acts  to  induce evaporation and captures the solvent vapors to dry  the  interface  and stop  dosing.  In  this  embodiment, the  heating element, which may be programmed to heat at a  certain time, heats the administration reservoir and/or skin  and/or the whole device which increases significantly evapo  ration and speeds up the process which in turn stops dosing  quickly. As an alternative to heat, a gas or air cartridge can  be present to  automatically, pursuant to  a programmed  schedule, blow air or gas onto the administration area to  rapidly dry the administration reservoir and stop dosing.   The inventive system or device allows for pulsatile trans  dermal drug delivery, and the administration of differing  sized dosages at different times of the day automatically,  pursuant to a pre-programmed dosage profile (e.g., a pro  gram Stored in memory accessed by the control unit). This  system or device can be most advantageous when the pre-set  or programmed drug delivery profile corresponds to desired  peaks and troughs in disease symptoms based on chronobi  ology and a person's circadian rhythms. This system or  device can also be highly advantageous in addiction man  agement when programmed to coincide with a person's peak  addiction cravings. This system or device can also be highly  advantageous when patient compliance with a particular  delivery regimen is a desired effect so that a person, whether  forgetful,  elderly,  children,  mentally impaired desires to  ensure correct drug delivery compliance. This device can  also be highly advantageous when a person or physician a  doctor wants to have a drug administered in differing dos  ages while asleep automatically without the need to wake  up, of if the drug being used is a stimulant and the person  does not want any drug released at night thereby causing  sleep disturbances, but does want the device to administer   \fUS RE46,217 E   9  drug shortly before waking so that therapeutically effective  blood plasma concentrations of the drug are present upon  Waking.   According to some embodiments of the present invention,  the device comprises a control and display unit, a dispensing  mechanism, e.g.,  a pump, pressurized reservoir or other  actuator, a drug reservoir, an administration element, and/or  a solvent/drug removal means (e.g., flushing the adminis  tration reservoir or using a desiccant or evaporative means  Such as heat or air/gas blowing to dry the administration  reservoir), and/or a vapor removal element, when appli  cable,  to  the  embodiment a  waste  reservoir,  and/or an  additional  micropump or  actuator.  Embodiments  of the  invention may include one or more of the following features.  The pump may be a peristaltic pump that includes a micro  motor, a roller, a mounting plate, a tubing, and a housing. As  discussed above, the peristaltic pump is separated into two  parts; the first part comprises the motor on the mounting  plate and the roller (e.g., provided in the reusable portion of  the device) and the second part includes the tubing and the  housing (e.g.,  provided in the detachable and disposable  passive portion of the device). The micromotor and the roller  are mounted in the device with the control unit. The speed  of the micromotor is controlled by the control unit, so that  the turning speed of the roller is controlled which, in turn,  controls the flow rate from the dispensing reservoir to the  administration reservoir. The tubing and the housing are  detachable from the device.   Embodiments of the invention may include one or more  of the following features. The tubing and the housing of the  peristaltic pump and the dispensing or drug reservoir are  combined together, resulting in one, interconnected dispos  able and replaceable dosing element. In other words, this  disposable dosing element (or detachable and disposable  passive portion) is a replaceable dosing capsule which can  be used for one or multiple dosings. This disposable dosing  capsule can  be 'Snapped  into  place prior to  Substance  administration by the patient or other health worker, and,  after the drug reservoir is exhausted, the disposable dosing  element is \u201cpopped  out to be disposed, and a fresh dispos  able dosing element is then \u201csnapped  back into the device.  The tubing is provided inside the body of the capsule in  Some embodiments. One end of the tubing is connected to  the drug or dispensing reservoir while the other end of the  tube is a fluidic adapter or distributor near the administration  reservoir or area near the patch or membrane. In certain  embodiments, the waste reservoir, desiccant chamber cap  turing vapors evaporated from the drug/solvent, tubing and  analogous components of the second micro pump or actuator  as the first pump mentioned above, a gas/air cartridge and  the administration reservoir may also be part of this Snapped  on or Snapped off portion or may be disposable pursuant to  another means. Further, embodiments of the invention may  include one or more of the following features. The dispos  able dose capsule, the administration element, and a drug/  Solvent removal element are connected and packed together  as a disposable package, whenever the dosage is needed to  applied to skin, the whole disposable package is  changed  and replaced into the device.   More particularly, an apparatus is provided for selectively  delivering a liquid,  powder, or temporarily  free-flowing  Solution (e.g., a drug formulation or the like). The apparatus  includes an active assembly with a controller and a power  Source (e.g., a battery). The apparatus further includes a  passive assembly configured for mechanically coupling and  decoupling with the active assembly. The passive assembly  includes a drug reservoir containing the drug formulation to   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   10  be delivered. The apparatus further includes a micropump or  other actuator that acts as the dispensing mechanism with an  active portion in the active assembly that provides a motive  force to draw or otherwise move the drug formulation from  the drug reservoir onto or into the administration reservoir.  The micropump or other actuator (or dispensing mechanism)  includes a passive portion provided in the detachable passive  assembly so as to be proximate to the active portion of the  micropumpfactuator. The passive portion defines a feed or  delivery chamber through which the drug formulation flows  from the drug reservoir when the motive force is applied to  the passive portion. In some embodiments, the micropump  or other actuator includes a peristaltic pump with the active  portion being made up of  a motor powered by the power  source and operated by the controller to control the motor  speed and its  time of operation;  a  roller  with  rotatably  mounted shoes; a shaft contacting the roller and driven by  the motor; and a mounting plate Supporting the motor. The  passive portion, in turn, includes a housing with a guide slot  or recessed surface for receiving the mounting plate and  roller so as to position one or more of the shoes in contact  with an outer surface of the feed chamber, which in some  embodiments is a length of compressible tubing. The guide  slot in these cases may include a curved surface and the  tubing is positioned between the roller/shoes and the curved  Surface Such that the motive force includes using the shoes  to sequentially compress the tubing.   The passive assembly may further include an administra  tion assembly including an administration reservoir con  nected to the tubing to receive the drug formulation and a  membrane adjacent the administration reservoir that is per  meable to  an active or effective  substance in  the  drug  formulation but not or less permeable to a solvent portion of  the liquid. In certain embodiments, an absorbent sheet (e.g.,  blotting paper or the like) may be provided in the adminis  tration reservoir so as to distribute the received liquid in a  relatively uniform manner over the surface of the membrane.  In other embodiments, instead of an absorbent sheet, the  administration reservoir may be or include a rigid or flexible,  permanent or disposable Substrate with a plurality of ducts,  conduits or culverts that contain internal passageways for  movement of the drug formulation and have either a series  of openings or a single opening mounted on the membrane  or skin or otherwise adjacent to the membrane or skin to  allow the drug formulation to  be absorbed or otherwise  transferred  or to  move from  the  substrate  ducts  to  the  membrane or skin for transdermal absorption. In this man  ner, the ducts, conduits, or culverts or in this Substrate can  be filled  by the micropump or other actuator with  drug  formulation originating in the drug reservoir. Then, these  ducts, conduit, or culverts can be flushed either by the first  micropump actuator or a second micropump or other actua  tor into a waste reservoir or flushed into an area for evapo  ration to begin and stop dosing in an accurate fashion. Yet  further, a heat element may be provided in the administration  assembly  near the  administration  reservoir  to  raise  the  temperature 3 to 10 degrees Celsius over a dermal tempera  ture to enhance transdermal permeation and/or diffusion  and/or movement of the drug formulation through the Sub  strate and in some cases to increase evaporation when it is  desired to dry the reservoir (or absorbent sheet). In the latter  instance, the heating element may be configured with a  plurality of flow paths for vapor or evaporated portions of  the liquid (such as solvent vapor) that facilitates relatively  uniform or at least well distributed flow away from the  reservoir.   \fUS RE46,217 E   11  Additional advantages and novel features of this invention  shall be set forth in part in the description that follows, and  in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon  examination of the following specification or may be learned  by the practice of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE  PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS   In the drawings, like reference numerals indicate like  features, and a reference numeral appearing in more than  one figure refers to the same element. The drawings and the  following detailed descriptions show specific embodiments  of the invention with numerous specific details including  materials, dimensions, and products being provided to facili  tate explanation and understanding of the invention. How  ever, it  will be obvious to one skilled in the art that the  present invention may be practiced without these specific  details and these broader embodiments of the invention are  considered within the breadth of the following claims.   The present invention is generally directed to a portable  drug delivery device that can controllably deliver a particu  lar dose accurately and in a timed manner. The devices of the  invention are typically configured with a reusable portion  and a disposable portion. The reusable portion typically  includes the display  and control  components such as  a  microprocessor, memory, interfaces, and power source and  also includes the active portion of a dispensing mechanism  (e.g., active portion of a micropump). The disposable por  tion can be selectively coupled or attached to the reusable  portion and includes the passive portion of the dispensing  mechanism (e.g., a micropump housing and feed or delivery  chamber/tubing) as well as the drug or dispensing reservoir  and also the administration assembly that may include an  administration reservoir, a diffusion membrane, and a sol  vent removal element. In this manner, the present invention  addresses problems with a membrane having a decreasing  diffusivity that may be caused by saturation with solvent, the  contact Surface becoming dirty or clogged, or other factors.  The device also facilitates  the  reuse of more expensive  components such as the microprocessor, memory compo  nents, a liquid crystal display (LCD) or other display, and  active pump portions. These and other unique features of the  invention will become apparent in the following description.  FIG. 1 illustrates  one embodiment of a portable drug  delivery device or assembly 1 of the present invention. The  device 1 is shown to generally take the form of a wrist watch  for easy attachment to a patients arm or wrist to place an  administration element and more specifically a diffusion  membrane for transdermal delivery (or,  in Some cases, a  needle for Subcutaneous delivery), e.g., an administration  assembly that can be removed from the reusable portion of  the device 1 shown in FIG. 1 is provided on the underside  or reverse side of the device 1.  The device 1 includes a  display 90 to allow a patient or user of the device 1 to obtain  a status of a dosing regimen, e.g., to know whether the   \fUS RE46,217 E   13  device 1 actively dosing, when a next dose may be admin  istered, how many doses remain for the device based on the  particular disposable dosing element, or the like. An input  area or keyboard/keypad 93 is provided to allow the user to  alter the display 90 and otherwise interact with the device 1.  FIG. 2 illustrates in block form the components of the  device 1 in one embodiment of the invention. The portable  device  1  as  shown is  configured  for transdermal  drug  delivery and includes a control and display unit 7, a dis  pensing mechanism 2, a drug reservoir 3, an administration  element 5, a solvent removal element 4, and a battery 6. A  liquid  is  typically  provided in  the  drug reservoir 3  for  dispensing via feed chamber or delivery tube 13. The liquid  includes a Sufficient or predetermined amount of one or more  active substances dissolved or dispersed at an appropriate  concentration in a formulation which contains a solvent (or  more volatile liquid) or a mixture of solvent along with the  active Substances. For example, the Solvent may include one  or more agents such as alcohols, oils,  water,  methylene  chloride, ethanol or the like. If appropriate, other excipients  may be provided in the reservoir 3 such as tissue permeation  promoter (enhancers),  thickening  Substances,  solubizers,  buffers,  chemical  stabilizers,  preservatives,  moisturizers,  humectants, emulsifiers, thinners, Surface-active agents, fra  grances, or the like. Examples of active Substances include,  but are not limited, to nicotine, Steroid hormones, analgesics,  antioxidants,  vitamins, CNS drugs, cardiovascular drugs,  anti-asthmatics, antibiotics, anti-cancer drugs, and the like  and the invention is intended to cover any drug or other  substance for which it is desirable to provide to a patient or  other body (animal or human) in a time and dose controlled   a.  The control and display unit 7 can be implemented, for  example, by a microprocessor 91 with a LCD or other  display 90 and a drive circuit  and/or interface 92. The  microprocessor 91 is programmed (with Software. Such as a  dosing regimen routine or the like, in memory for example)  as a programmable timer to send a control signal to the  dispensing mechanism 2 through the drive circuit 92 at  multiple timing points.  Battery 6 provides power to  the  device 1. In a specific embodiment, the dispensing mecha  nism 2 is a two-part peristaltic micropump (e.g., a peristaltic  pump with an active portion that is provided with reusable  portion of device 1 and a passive portion that is provided  with detachable and disposable portion 40) that delivers a  drug formulation from the drug reservoir 3 to the adminis  tration element 5 at a certain flow rate and a certain duration  that are defined by the microprocessor 91 of the control and  display unit 7.   In some embodiments, the drug reservoir 3 is in form of  a collapsible  balloon  that  contains  drug formulation. A  flexible and collapsible reservoir 3 is preferable in the device  1 to avoid back pressures that may resist flow from the  reservoir 3 if a more rigid-walled reservoir were utilized.  The walls  of the  reservoir 3 are also  preferably  resist  permeation, i.e., are non-permeable or relatively imperme  able, of the solvent/drug mixture or formulation and in this  regard, the walls may be formed of TeflonTM, a high molecu  lar membrane, or other similar material.   The administration element 5 is typically provided in the  disposable, detachable portion or unit 40 to allow it to be  periodically replaced with a new element 5. This is useful for  providing a new membrane to achieve a known diffusion  rate and to provide a new administration reservoir (and any  wicking material or the like provided in Such an adminis  tration reservoir as discussed below). As shown, the admin  istration element 5 includes an administration reservoir 34   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   14  and a diffusion membrane 35 (e.g., a membrane that allows  a particular diffusion  rate  for the drug in  the  liquid  or  mixture in the drug reservoir 3 but is impermeable or much  less permeable to the solvent).   As will be discussed in detail, one aspect of the invention  is the inclusion of material. Such as blotting paper or sheet,  in the reservoir 34 to uniformly distribute the formulation to  the diffusion membrane both in Volume (e.g., the liquid is  relatively equally provided over the upper surface of the  membrane rather than much more at the outlet of the feed or  delivery chamber/tube 13) and at a relatively uniform rate.  For example, in one embodiment, the administration ele  ment 5 includes an absorption sheet (e.g., blotting paper or  the like to \u201cwick\u2019 the liquid from chamber or tube 13 over  the administration reservoir 34) and a membrane which are  laminated tightly together at their interface and typically to  the edges of the frame of the element 5. The particular  membrane used for membrane 35 is not limiting and may  include, but is not limited to a membrane of microporous  polyethylene, polyethylene co-vinyl acetate (EVA copoly  mer, polyurethane, and the like.  A device-skin interface  coupling  media and/or control  membrane or layer  may  further be provided of ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellu  lose, poly(ethylene co-vinyl acetate), polyvinyl pyrrolidone,  poly(ethylene oxide), poly(ethylene vinyl alcohol) and the  like.   Tubing or a feed chamber 13 is provided in the detachable  and disposable unit 40 to connect the drug reservoir 3 to the  administration element 5 through passive portion of the  dispensing mechanism 2. When the device 1 is positioned  for use, the membrane 35 is preferably in tight contact with  the skin using an adhesive and/or wristband. The device 1  then operates to provide even diffusion of the drug over the  drug absorption surface area of the membrane 35. A solvent  removal element 4 is typically provided in the device 1 (e.g.,  in the reusable portion as shown or in the disposable portion  in Some cases) to control dosing by removing the solvent or  fluid mixture. The element 4 may include desiccant, absor  bent material, or other material to absorb evaporating Sol  vent, with the element 4 being connected to the administra  tion element Such as by one or more tubes (not shown). A  connection is shown between the interface or drive circuit 92  of control  unit  7,  and this  may be used to  sense the  concentration of a drug in the administration reservoir 34  and to control operation of the solvent removal element  (e.g.,  in embodiments where active components are pro  vided to  further solvent removal as discussed below). In  Some embodiments, these connections may also be used to  allow the control 7 to receive temperature signals from a  sensor contacting or near the reservoir 34 and/or membrane  35.   In some preferred embodiments, the dispensing mecha  nism 2 is a micropump, e.g., positive displacement micro  pump. For example, the pump 2 may be a two part piezo  electric micropump in which the drive or active portion is  provided in the reusable portion of the device 1 and the  chamber 13 is provided in the disposable portion 40. In one  preferred embodiment, the micropump is  configured as a  two-part peristaltic pump that can be provided as an active  part and a passive part to allow the active part to be provided  in the reusable portion of device 1 and the passive parts  including the tube or feed chamber 13 and portions of the  pump housing (including the compression Surface) provided  in the detachable and disposable portion 40.   According to  one representative embodiment, FIG.  3  shows a disassembled peristaltic pump for use as dispensing  mechanism 2. The pump 2 has two parts or elements: an   \fUS RE46,217 E   15  active part and a passive part. The active part is an assembly  of a motor 17, a mounting plate 11, a roller 12 attached to  a shaft of motor 17, and shoes 15, which are rotatably  mounted to roller 12 and are shown as four ball bearings (but  two or more shoes 15 may be used and other configurations  other than ball bearings may be used to practice the inven  tion). The active part is preferably housed with the other  components of reusable portion of device 1  such as the  battery 6 and control and display unit 7, such as with the  plate 11 and drive components 12 and 15 being exposed with  the motor 17 being completely or partially inserted into the  housing wall (not shown).   The passive part of the dispensing mechanism 2 is, in  contrast, provided in the disposable portion 40 as shown in  FIG. 1 and is designed or configured for coupling with the  plate 11 and drive components 12, 15 of the active portion  of the mechanism 2. The passive part is an assembly of a  pump housing 14 and a tubing or feed chamber 13. A  receiving slot or guide 16 is provided with an opening and  internal Surfaces (including an arched or arcuate compres  sion surface 16A shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 on which the tube  13  is  positioned  for compression by the  shoes  15) for  receiving the active portion, e.g., receiving and Supporting  plate 11, rollers 12, and shoes 15 while allowing motor 17  casing to slide through the outer wall of housing 14.   The motor 17 can be a stepping motor or a DC motor that  is speed-controlled by a control unit (such as control 91 via  interface 92). The motor 17 is  mounted on the mounting  plate 11 that is fixed in a device, which is the device 1 in the  embodiments of this invention and the plate 11 and part of  the motor 17 may extend out from a housing (not shown)  that houses the non-disposable components (i.e., the com  ponents that are not part of unit 40 in FIG. 1). The roller 12  is mounted on the axis or drive shaft of the motor 17. On the  roller 12, there are four ball bearings 15. In the housing 14.  there is  a slot  16 that accommodates the motor 17, the  mounting plate  11,  and the roller  12. The tubing  13 is  inserted through the housing 14 on which there are provided  two holes. Tubing 13 passes through the holes.   FIG. 3 shows a cross sectional view of the peristaltic  pump dispensing mechanism 2 in which the passive part is  slid up so that it is positioned to where the bearings 15 on  the roller 12 press against the tubing 13 properly and when  rotated periodically compress the tube 13 against the arched  or curved surface 16A. The tubing 13 is flexible so that the  bearings 15 on the roller 12 press the tubing 13 against an  arc 16A and move the fluid along through the tube 13. In this  embodiment, the four bearings 15 on the roller 12 act as  shoes to press on the tubing 13. Three to five or more shoes  15 can be used. When assembled in a portable drug delivery  device, the tubing 13 connects the drug reservoir 3 to the  administration element 5 in the application of the device 1  shown in FIG. 1.   The use of a peristaltic pump as the dispensing mecha  nism 2 provides significant advantages for a drug delivery  device according to the invention. These advantages include  low risk of drug formulation contamination as the drug only  contacts the tubing and not the drive components of the  pump 2 and this tube 13 is disposed of with the disposable  unit. The use of a peristaltic pump 2 also provides simple  and cost-effective operation, accuracy of dosing, low main  tenance, self-priming, and gentle pumping action, as well as  the ability to pump liquid, mixed-phase and Viscous fluids,  and the elimination of the need to clean or flush the pump or  tubing of substance residue, to ensure sterility of the device  over period of time. One of the chief advantages of the  peristaltic pump 2 for the drug delivery device 1 is that the   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   16  drug formulation from the drug reservoir 3 to the adminis  tration element 5 does not contact any internal parts. Seals  and valves are not needed as in other pumps.   FIGS. 5A-5C show one preferred embodiment of a dose  capsule 20 with a drug reservoir 26 and a peristaltic pump  housing 16 (e.g.,  the passive portion  of the dispensing  mechanism 2).  Inside  the  drug reservoir  26 there  is  a  collapsible balloon 29 with an inlet 25 and an outlet. The  inlet 25 is connected to a fluidic fitting for drug formulation  pre-loading (e.g., filling of the balloon or flexible, collaps  ible reservoir 29). The outlet is or connected to internal  tubing  24,  which  is  pulled  through  the  housing 16 to  compose a peristaltic pump 2 with tubing 13 (e.g., internal  tubing connected to reservoir, tubing in contact with shoes  15 and surface 16A, and external tubing that extends out  from housing  14 to  connect with  an administration  or  delivery assembly or element (such as element 30 of FIG. 6).  By combining the peristaltic pump housing 16 with the  drug reservoir 26 (both of which are typically formed of a  rigid plastic  or the like),  the dose capsule 20 can be a  disposable element separately or with the delivery element,  as discussed below. When the drug formulation is replaced,  the tubing 13, 24 of the pump 2 is also simultaneously  replaced. The design of the present invention minimizes or  eliminates the need for cleaning the peristaltic pump of the  device. Another main practical advantage of this design is to  avoid shelf-time problems of the device. If the peristaltic  pump is assembled with the housing and the tubing, the  shoes on the roller will press against the tubing for a long  period of the shelf time, which may result in tubing defor  mation problems and affect the accuracy of the flow rate of  the peristaltic pump. If the drug reservoir and the peristaltic  pump are not assembled together as shown and described, it  may be inconvenient for a patient  to  change the  drug  formulation because the disconnection and connection of the  tubing with the drug reservoir, and priming the pump are not  user friendly and easy tasks. Our embodiment separates the  peristaltic pump into two parts, the active and passive parts,  in order to retain the expensive active part of the peristaltic  pump in the device and combine the passive part with the  drug reservoir. This approach of the two components mini  mizes or eliminates the problems detailed above.   FIG. 5C shows an embodiment of this invention with the  passive portion of the dispensing mechanism 2 disassembled  from the active part. The active part of the peristaltic pump,  i.e., the motor 17, the mounting plate 11, and the roller 12,  is retained in the device (e.g., device 1 of FIG. 1) and is not  typically disposable (e.g., is reusable). The passive part, i.e.,  the peristaltic pump portions including the housing 14, the  receiving slot or guide 16, and the tubing 13 and 24, is  combined with the drug reservoir 26 with fill connection 25  to form the disposable dose capsule 20 which is replaceable  as shown with line 19. The end of external tubing 13 is  connected to an administration element (Such as shown in  FIG. 6) for drug delivery from the reservoir 26.   FIG. 6 shows a cross sectional  view of one preferred  embodiment of a delivery element 30 for connection to  tubing or feed chamber 13 to receive the drug mixture 29A  from a flexible drug reservoir liner 29. Such connection of  the element 30 and the dose capsule may be done by the  user/patient or more typically, are done for the patient (Such  as by a dose Supplier or manufacturer) Such that the user/  patient can simply \u201csnap' offa used/depleted disposable unit  or portion of a device and 'Snap' or connect a new unit  including both a dosing capsule and the delivery element 30   \fUS RE46,217 E   17  (with this connection acting to couple the passive and active  portions of the dispensing mechanism such as two parts of  a pump).   As shown, the delivery element or assembly 30 includes  a housing 37, a tubing or fill line 31 with an optional conic  or funnel-shaped end 36.  In  this  embodiment, a solvent  removal element 32 (such  as  element 4 of FIG.  1)  is  provided in the element 30 so as to support solvent removal  to control or end dosing. For example, a desiccant filling 32  may be provided in chambers of housing 37 as shown. A  frame 33 defines an administration reservoir at one end of  the housing (e.g., distal to the connection line 31) that can  be filled with fluid 29A. To facilitate more uniform distri  bution of the liquid 29A, an absorption sheet 34 such as  blotting paper or other material that functions to absorb and  wick or transport the liquid 29A from conical outlet 36 about  the area of the reservoir, is provided in the reservoir (or to  define the administration reservoir by filling the reservoir  chamber defined by frame 33).   The blotting paper or absorption sheet 34 acts to hold the  liquid 29A to provide a more controllable diffusion rate for  element 30 and typically  the sheet 34 is  \u201csaturated  by  selecting  a  volume of liquid  29A to  wet the  entire  or  substantially the entire sheet 34. The element 30 further  includes a diffusion membrane 35 that typically abuts and  may even be laminated to absorption sheet 34. The housing  37 with the frame 33 forms a chamber that is  a solvent  removing element 4 of FIG. 1, where the absorbent material  32 Such as a desiccant filling is placed. The absorption sheet  34 and the diffusion membrane 35 are laminated together in  some embodiments. The absorptions sheet 34 can be blotting  paper, Sponge, porous plastics, porous rubber, cellulose, or  other materials (e.g., material with similar liquid absorbency  and/or wicking properties), with a thickness in the range or  0.3 to 3 mm or more.   Drug formulation 29A is  delivered by the dispensing  mechanism 2 that is connected to the tubing or fill line 31.  The conic end 36 of the tubing 31 may be contacted to the  absorption film 34 or be spaced apart. The drug formulation  29A dispensed through the tubing 31 is soaked up by the  absorption film or sheet 34. The diffusion membrane 35 is  preferably,  but not necessarily, in  tight contact with the  absorption film 34 on one side and with a patient\u2019s skin on  another side (when in use), and provides an even diffusion  of the drug over its surface area. The conic end 36 provides  a larger absorption area, which facilitates distribution of the  liquid  29A and also  inhibits  accumulation  of the  drug  formulation at the end of the tubing and capillary action that  draws the drug formulation back into the tubing 31 when the  dispensing mechanism stops.   The solvent of the drug formulation evaporates continu  ously from the absorption film 34. Vapor is trapped by the  desiccant 32 in  the  solvent  removing element.  Solvent  removal serves the purpose of withdrawing depleted solvent  from the absorption film 34 and the membrane 35, so that,  after repeated dispensing no freely moving liquid is formed.  The amount of drug delivered increases by increasing the  volume of dispensed formula. Furthermore, by withdrawal  of solvent in-between dispensing events, drug concentration  steadily increases and reaches Saturation or possibly Super  saturation in the absorption film 34 and the membrane 35,  thereby maximizing delivery rate. When dispensing of the  drug formulation  is  stopped the residual  solvent in  the  absorption film 34 and the membrane 35 is  removed by  element 32. The absorption film 34 and the membrane 35 are  dried which stops drug delivery.   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   18  FIG. 7 shows a  combination  (e.g.,  a disposable and  detachable portion) 40 of the delivery element 30 with the  dose capsule 20 shown in FIG. 6 and FIG. 4, respectively.  The disposable portion 40 may be an integral body of the  dose capsule 20 and the delivery element 30 or may be two  housings that are mechanically connected or fastened. Tub  ing 13 connects the internal tubing 24 in the dose capsule 20  for the peristaltic pump with tubing or fill  line 31 in the  delivery element 30. The combination 40 can be molded and  assembled to be a package for one dose of a treatment or  multiple doses of a dosing regimen. Drug formulation can be  pre-loaded into the drug reservoir 26. The 13, 24 can also be  embedded in the body of the combination of the delivery  element 30 and the dose capsule 20. Whenever the drug  formulation is  replaced, the tubing, the desiccant, and the  absorption  and membrane are  all  replaced,  so  that  the  problems for the customer related to tubing disconnection  and connection, desiccant replacement, and the absorption  and membrane change are minimized or eliminated. Plug  ging the dose assembly or disposable portion 40 into the  device 1 by connection of housing 14 with receiving groove  16 with the active portions of a dispensing mechanism or  pump 2 as  discussed  above allows  customers  such  as  patients and medical technicians to easily operate a portable  drug deliver device of the present invention.   In a further embodiment of a solvent removal element 4,  FIG. 8 shows a cross sectional view of an embodiment 50  that blows air or other gas onto an administration sheet 44  (or through an empty administration reservoir) to aid in the  evaporation  of solvent.  The preferred  embodiment  50  includes a housing 47, and a tubing adapter or fill line 41  with a conic end 46. In the reusable portion, a gas source or  blower is  provided (but not shown) that  may include a  pump/blower, a pressurized canister with a volume of pres  Surized gas, or the like as well as controls and Valving as  necessary to provide selective flow of the gas. In the element  50, it is desirable to control the flow of the gas. To this end,  a cellular element 53 (e.g., a porous channel element, a  honeycomb member, or the like) is positioned in the housing  47 to cause the air or other gas to flow relatively evenly  across the absorption sheet 44 rather than simply in certain  areas.  As shown,  the  air  distribution  manifold  further  includes an air inlet 51 and outlets 52 (with or without  one-way check valves). The element 50 further includes an  administration sheet 44, a diffusion  membrane 45, and a  conduit 43 between the cellular element 53 and the admin  istration sheet 44. The housing 47 with the cellular element  53 forms a chamber 48 that creates a path for airflow away  from the  sheet 44 through the element 53, through the  chamber 48, and out of the element 47 via the outlets 52.  The airflow comes in from the inlet 51 at a volume, flow  rate, and duration selected typically to dry (to a desired level  or  substantially  completely)  the  sheet  44.  The airflow  spreads  in  the conduit 43 and on the back side of the  administration  sheet 44,  then  flows through the cellular  element 53 and the outlet 52 to the outside of the element 50.  The solvent delivered onto the administration sheet 44 with  the drug formulation is carried away with the airflow. Once  the residual solvent in the administration film 44 and the  membrane 45 is removed, the administration sheet 44 and  the membrane 45 are dried which stops drug delivery. In this  manner, a pulse pattern  for drug delivery is  realized by  programming the drug delivery time and duration, and the  airflow time and duration. In other words, the delivery of a  drug or active substance can better be controlled not only by  the accurate providing of a drug formulation to the element  50 but also the rapid and controlled removal of the formu   \fUS RE46,217 E   19  lation by drying of the sheet or reservoir 44. The flow rate  and duration of the gas such as air may vary to practice the  invention and may be selected depending upon the particular  solvent utilized.   FIG. 9 shows a cross sectional view of an embodiment of  5   an administration element 60 that can apply heat onto an  administration sheet 64 to enhance drug permeation of the  skin and to also enhance evaporation (as discussed above  with reference to air/gas flow, which may be combined with  heater  element  in  some  embodiments).  The  preferred  embodiment 60 includes a housing 67, a tubing adapter with  a conic end 66, a heat element 61, vents 62, an administra  tion sheet 64, a diffusion membrane 65, a temperature sensor  69, and a conduit 63 between the heat element 61 and the  administration sheet 64 (or reservoir). The housing 67 above  the heat element 61 forms or defines a chamber 68 that  creates a path for solvent evaporation. The heat element 61  can be turned on and off by programming and controlled by  a microprocessor Such as that provided in a typical control  and display unit.   In some embodiments, a particular temperature is main  tained at the administration area, Such as 2 to 10 degrees  Celsius and preferably at  least about 4 degrees Celsius  higher than typically body temperature when the device 1 is  being operated for drug delivery as Such a temperature range  will  significantly  increase  drug permeation  or diffusion  through  the  membrane 65 and into  the  skin.  In  some  embodiments, the drug formulation is applied on the admin  istration sheet 64 and the heat element 61 is turned on and  left  on or cycled during drug delivery operations or as  needed to maintain a desired temperature or temperature  range. The temperature sensor 69 is provided (e.g., embed  ded) in the conduit 63 and operates to sense the temperature  on the administration sheet 64 and send a signal to micro  processor 91 through the interface 92.  By this  feedback  control, the temperature on the administration sheet 64 can  be kept at 4 degrees Celsius (or a range about this or another  drug delivery set point) above the body temperature Such as  proximate to  40 degrees Celsius.  After drug delivery  is  completed, the heater element 61 may be operated to provide  additional heat, such as by raising the temperature to 5 to 10  degrees Celsius or more above skin temperature, to hasten  evaporation of the solvent from reservoir or absorbent sheet  64. Once the residual solvent in the administration film 44  and the membrane 45 evaporate, e.g., in about 30 minutes  from experimental results, and the administration sheet 44  and the membrane 45 are dried, the heat element 61 is turned  off (with this control being determined by a moisture sensor  (not shown) or by experiential knowledge for a particular  reservoir/sheet, solvent, heater, and temperature combina  tion  (e.g.,  a known operating time for drying based on  results).   FIG. 10 shows an embodiment of the control and display  unit 7 useful for realizing the functions of the one or all  embodiments of this invention. The control and display unit  7 is one or several electric circuit boards with the micro  processor system 91, the display 90, the keyboard 93, and  the interface 92. The unit 7 may further include one or  memory devices 85 for storing dosing regimens or routines  for running by processor 91 to control the operation (dura  tion and speed to control flow rate) of the dispensing unit 2.  the heater 61, and/or an air/gas source (not shown) to control  diffusion rates for a device incorporating unit 7. The inter  face 92 includes an interface circuit 94, a drive circuit 95 for  the dispensing unit 2 in the all embodiments; a drive circuit  96 for the heat element 61 and/or air/gas  supply, and a  temperature amplification  circuit 97 for the temperature   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   20  sensor(s)  69.  The control  signals  and the  measurement  signals are output from or input to the microprocessor 91  through the interface circuit 94.   The dosing regimen 86 may be used to provide the flow  rate for the pump/driving mechanism 2 and also the timing  of its  operation.  A typical  reservoir  may provide  drug  volumes that can be applied for multiple days (such as for 3  or more days), and controlled transdermal release of an  active material Such as a drug can be timed and dosages  selected  to  better  match a body's  rhythms  to  enhance  chronopharmacological efficacy. Specifically, the co-pend  ing and published U.S. patent application Ser. No. 1 1/162,  525, entitled \u201cBiosynchronous Transdermal Drug Delivery'  filed  Sep.  13,  2005, which is  incorporated herein  in  its  entirety by reference, describes the use of specific dosing  regimens to select dosing (e.g., flow rates to the adminis  tration element) and also the timing of Such dosages to  enhance the effectiveness of the particular drug (e.g., treat  heart attack and stroke in early morning hours, treat arthritis  prior to a patient awakening, and the like). This references  teaching is incorporated for use in configuring the dosing  regiment 86 and otherwise for controlling operation of the  processor 91 and other processors for operating the dispens  ing  mechanism 2  (its  flow  rate  and timing/duration  of  operation) and solvent removal components.   Another embodiment of this  invention of a device for  transdermal drug delivery is shown in FIG. 11 as a device  100 for multiple drug formulations. The device 100 includes  a control and display unit with a microprocessor system 101,  an interface 102, a display 104, and a keyboard 103. Also,  the device 100 includes a battery 106; a dispensing mecha  nism 109 (such as pumps 2 described above with an active  and passive portion); drug reservoirs 111, 112, and 113; a  3-way fluidic switch 110; a solvent removal element 105;  and an administration element 107 (such as a reservoir with  a wicking filler or absorbent sheet) with a diffusion mem  brane 108.   The control and display unit may be similar as the unit 7  in device 1 of FIG. 1, except there is a control signal for the  3-way fluidic  switch 110 to select one of the three drug  formulations in the reservoir 111, 112, and 113 respectively.  The fluidic switch is like a 3-way fluidic valve for 3-to-1  fluidic selection. Under the microprocessor 101 control, one  of the three drug formulations can be selected to apply to the  administration element 107 through the dispensing mecha  nism 109. In this embodiment, three drug formulations are  presented but the number of the drug formulation can be 2  or 4 or more and is not limiting of the invention. The device  100 can be used to apply drugs or active Substances sequen  tially with drying completed between dosing of each drug in  reservoirs 111, 112, 113. Alternatively, two or more of the  drugs may be applied to the membrane 108 via the admin  istration  element 107 and feed tube 115 by providing a  volume of each liquid to the element 107 sequentially but  with little or no gap between operation of mechanism 109  (e.g., apply drug in reservoir 111 and then immediately or  after only a short delay the drug from reservoirs 112 and/or  113).   The dispensing mechanism 109 can be a peristaltic micro  pump (as discussed above) but can also be a diaphragm or  other positive displacement micropump such as a piezoelec  tric micropump. The solvent removal element 105 can be a  desiccant pack, a blowing-air element, or a heat element (or  a combination thereof), as described in the other embodi  ments. The administration element 107 and the diffusion  membrane 108 can be an absorption sheet laminated with a  diffusion  membrane. This embodiment shows dispensing   \fUS RE46,217 E   21  multiple drug formulations separately and selectively by the  control of the microprocessor 101, which is programmed  according to a doctor's prescription.   Another preferred embodiment of this  invention  of a  device for transdermal drug delivery is shown in FIG. 12 as  a  device  200  for  concurrent  delivery  of multiple  drug  formulations (e.g., 2 or more). The device 200 includes a  control and display unit with a microprocessor System 201,  an interface 202, a display 204, and a keyboard 203. The  device 200 further includes a battery 206; a dispensing  mechanism or pump 209; drug reservoirs 211 and 212; a  solvent removal element 205; and administration elements  207 and 208 with a diffusion  membrane 210, which are  separated into two areas by wall or separator 216. The device  200 is similar with the device 100 except that the device 200  can dispense multiple drug formulations simultaneously.   The dispensing mechanism 209 is  a multiple channel  liquid delivery device. Such as a multiple channel peristaltic  micropump. In this embodiment, two drug reservoirs 211  and 212 are connected to the dispensing mechanism 209,  then under the control of the dispensing mechanism 209,  applied to the administration elements 207 and 208 via feed  tubes or channels 213 and 214. Even though the two drug  formulations  are  demonstrated  in  this  embodiment,  the  number of the drug formulations can vary and is not limited  to two as shown in FIG. 12.   FIG.  13  shows an embodiment of the administration  element 215 with the two administration areas 207 and 208  and a divider 216. The drug formulations are delivered to the  conic ends of feed tubes or channels 213 and 214 by the  dispensing mechanism 209. The diffusion membrane 210 is  proximate to and in some cases in tight contact with the  administration element 215 to provide an even diffusion of  the drugs over its Surface area. In this manner, two or more  diffusion areas 207,208 can be divided on the administration  element 215 to provide multiple drug formulations delivery  simultaneously.   While only transdermal drug delivery embodiments are  shown, many of the features of the invention are equally  applicable to Subcutaneous drug delivery. For example, the  inventors envision the use of the micropumps, such as the  two part pumps and dosing capsules, to Subcutaneous drug  delivery in hospitals and other similar settings. In one Such  embodiment, the device 1 of FIGS. 2 to 10 and devices 100  and 200 of FIGS. 11 to 13 may be modified by replacing the  administration  element and membrane with a needle or  coupling from the dispensing mechanism to an intravenous  connection. In these embodiments, the pump may be the  peristaltic pump which would allow the dosing capsule to  readily be attached, detached, and replaced as described  above to  facilitate  dosing  with  differing  drugs  without  requiring disposable of the active portion of the pump and  the display unit.   As discussed above, the dispensing mechanism of the  invention may be a two-part (e.g., active and passive por  tions) peristaltic pump. Such a pump may take a number of  forms to practice the invention, but the following discussion  with reference to FIGS. 14-18 provides one useful embodi  ment of Such a peristaltic micropump.   Various types of micropumps have been developed for  delivering or dispensing a controlled flow of a liquid in a  Small, measurable (or known) quantity. In the field of drug  delivery, it is recognized that Supplying a drug in a correct  temporal pattern  is  an  important attribute  of any drug  delivery methodology. Controlled release drug delivery sys  tems,  such  as  those  described  herein,  are  intended  to  improve the response to a drug and/or lessen side effects of   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   22  that drug. This is also important in the field of chronophar  macology, where biological rhythms are an important aspect  of clinical  pharmacology and are preferably  taken  into  account when controlling a drug delivery system (or select  ing a dosing regimen).   There has been an extensive amount of research into the  design of various micropumps. Currently, most micropumps  are driven by a piezoelectric element bonded to a flexible  membrane covering the  pump chamber.  Many research  groups have developed various micropumps such as pumps  with pumping pressures over 7 m of water and micropumps  using nozzles and/or diffuser components, which even at  miniature length  scales  results  in  accurate flow  Volume  control and high reliability. Some of these micropumps are  relatively low cost, high performance silicon micropumps  for disposable drug delivery systems (such as the micro  pump described in Maillefer, D., et al., \u201cA High Performance  Silicon Micropump for an Implantable Drug Delivery Sys  tem.\u201d Technical Digest MEMS '99,  pp. 541-546,  1999,  which is  incorporated herein by reference). Similarly, the  piezoelectric diaphragm micropumps available from Star  Micronics may be used in the dispensing mechanism of the  invention, and generally include a diaphragm bonded to a  piezo-ceramic element that mechanically vibrates to induce  change of chamber Volume and, thus, conveys fluid or gas  through the pump chamber (which, in  the embodiments  described above, would be in  the passive portion of the  dispensing mechanism).   However, it  should be noted that there may be some  drawbacks to  using piezoelectric  materials to achieve a  micropump (although they have been well developed where  a pump element is oscillated by the application of electrical  impulses  on piezoelectric  elements to  create  a pressure  differential  in  a liquid).  First,  piezoelectric  elements are  formed from brittle crystal materials that are difficult and  expensive to machine, particularly on Small scales. Second,  piezoelectric materials generally are not suitable for con  tacting liquids. Micropumps that exploit piezoelectric move  ment typically must be designed to insulate the piezoelectric  material from contact with liquid. Third, even though the  power consumption of the piezoelectric micropump is typi  cally low, electrical circuitry with a high Voltage Supply is  necessary  to  drive  and control  piezoelectric  movement,  which requires a certain Voltage and current power Supply to  work.  For portable  devices  and devices  powered by  a  battery, this presents a challenge for using a piezoelectric  pump in the dispensing mechanism.   In contrast, peristaltic pumps are desirable for use in the  dispensing mechanism as they use a flexible tube that is  compressed by a series of shoes on a roller to induce liquid  flow.  Such pumps provide a positive  displacement and  require little  or no maintenance. A continuous tube that  contains  the  fluid  to  be moved (such  as  in  a  cooling  embodiment) or delivered sits between the shoes and a rigid  wall (e.g., the curved Surface provided the housing of the  passive portion of the dispensing mechanism). The shoes  pinch the tube against the wall as the roller is turned by an  electric  motor, which creates  a positive pressure on the  output side of the tube and a negative pressure on the input  side. Peristaltic pumps are self-priming, and the only mate  rial in contact with the solution or liquid is the tube. Thus,  a wide variety of fluid-compatible tube material can be  selected to  meet the life  expectancy (e.g.,  the expected  number of cycles and the like). There is a demand for a  battery-driven or a low-voltage-driven micropump that is   \fUS RE46,217 E   23  able to induce an amount of liquid flow. For life sciences, it  is often preferable that the micropump be relatively inex  pensive and disposable.   In general, the peristaltic micropumps of the invention  include a motor, a housing, a housing cover, a roller with  shoes, and a tube. The tube contains fluids and sits between  the shoes on the roller and a rigid wall of the housing. The  shoes pinch the tube against the wall as the roller is turned  by an electric motor. Embodiments of the peristaltic micro  pump may include one or more of the following features.  The roller or roller assembly may include a bracket upon  which the shoes are mounted, e.g., with axes posts for the  shoe mounting. The shoes on the roller may be an assembly  of bearing or bushings that are mounted on the bracket of the  roller. The minimum number of shoes are tow but typically  three, four, or more are provided. The tube may be a module  made from elastomer or rubber with a fluidic channel and  fittings on the channel ends. The channels may be built Such  that the module can be pinched. The shape of the channel  may be rectangular so that the channel can be easily pinched.  Furthermore, the shape of the channel can be a specially  designed shape that reduces the friction between the wall of  the channel and the shoes on the  roller  and makes the  channel  fully  closed by the  compression of the  shoes.  Further, the housing cover may include a chamber that is  built to accommodate a tube or tube module. On both the  housing and the housing cover, alignment slots, bushings,  and spring loaded tips may be provided to keep the tube  module in the position where the shoes on the roller can  pinch the channel in the module properly to cause liquid  flow.   FIGS. 14 and 15 illustrate a peristaltic micropump 300  according to one embodiment of the invention. This micro  pump 300 may be used for the dispensing mechanisms  shown in the prior figures with the passive portion being the  housing cover 350 and in some cases, the housing 316. As  shown, the micropump 300 includes a motor 310 (e.g., an  electric stepping motor that can be driven by a battery and  controlled by the control and display units described above).  The motor is attached to a housing 316 that mates with a  housing cover 350. The housing 316 has sidewalls with  holes 318 for receiving spring-loaded ball  tips  or other  mechanisms for coupling with a housing cover 350. To  achieve alignment, a slot 320 is provided in the housing  sidewalls for receiving and allowing movement of alignment  rods 322 of the housing cover 350.   Driven by the motor 310 is a roller 330 that mates with a  drive shaft 334 of the motor 310. On the roller 330, a number  of shoes 336 are mounted, e.g., 2 to 4 or more shoes about  the periphery of the roller bracket, in a manner that allows  each of the shoes 330 to spin about its central axis. During  operation, the roller 330 spins about the central axis of the  shaft 334, which is driven by motor 310 and the shoes 336  contact an outer tube surface  and spin  while applying  compressive forces on the tube surface.   The micropump 300 is configured such that the active or  driving portions (e.g., the roller and shoes) do not contact a  liquid that is  pumped. To this  end, the  micropump 300  includes a housing cover 350 with recessed surfaces for  receiving a tube module 354. The tube module 354 functions  to position a tube or feed/delivery chamber relative to the  rotating or rotatable roller 330 and shoes 336 of the active  portions of the pump. To this end, the module 354 includes  tube fittings 356 that provide a coupling mechanism (such as  a male tube fitting) formating with a tube (not shown). The  module 354 could be configured with a tube attached to the   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   24  fittings 356 that places a tube in an arcuate or curved contact  surface 352 in the housing cover (similar as the embodi  ments shown in FIGS. 2-13).   As shown, though, the module 354 is formed substantially  as a single molded piece that has openings at the tube fittings  356 for receiving liquid such as from a tube attached to a  drug reservoir (or a cooling reservoir or coolant source) at an  inlet, for passing liquid through the internal cavity or cham  ber 353 (in FIGS. 17 and 18) of the module, and for passing  liquid out the other fitting 356 to an outlet tube attached to  the  fitting  (e.g.,  a tube  connected to  an administration  element (or to a coolant loop or system). The outer Surfaces  of the  module 354 are configured to  abut the recessed  surfaces 357 of the housing cover 350 and to also present a  curved wall surface 352 for contacting the shoes 336 of the  roller 330 when the roller 330 is rotated by the motor 310 via  drive shaft 334. In this manner, the tube module 354 defines  the  feed or delivery  chamber 353  for  the  solvent/drug  mixture, coolant, or other liquid while also providing contact  and positioning Surfaces of the passive portion of a two-part  peristaltic  pump 300 rather than requiring a tube and a  special configuration in the housing cover 350 to achieve  tube alignment and to retain  Such a tube in a particular  position or channel for contacting the shoes 336.   The motor 310 used to rotate the roller 330 can be either  a DC motor or a stepping motor. On the housing 316 and the  housing cover 350 there are alignment slots 320, 361 and  rods 322 that keep both parts in position while the housing  cover 350 is open or closed, such as when the tube of the  tube module is changed or the tube module 354 is replaced.  The housing cover 350 can be tilted up to 180 degrees for  tube changing. On the housing 316 and the housing cover  350 there are also spring loaded ball keys 319 and key slots  358 and key holes 359 that keep the position for the tube  module 354, such that the tube or module is pinched by the  shoes 336 when the cover 350 is closed onto the housing 316  when the motor 310 is operated.   In the embodiment shown in FIG. 17, the module 354 may  include the internal channel 353 and a curved wall 352 for  receiving the shoes 336 on roller 330. This arrangement is  further shown in FIG. 18, which shows tubing module 354  with a tube fitting 356 and a channel 353 for directing a  known volume or flow of liquid through the module 354.  During operation, the roller 330 with the shoes 336 to  pinch or apply compressive forces on the flexible tube is a  key component as  it  is  useful  for  obtaining a positive  displacement and maintain an accurate flow in  the tube  module 354. The roller or roller assembly 330 is shown in  more detail in FIG. 16, and, as shown, it includes a bracket  370 and the shoes 336, with a minimum number of shoes  336 being two with four being a useful number for many  applications. On the bracket 370, there are provided bearing  axis posts 376 upon which bearings 378 with shoes 336 are  mounted. At the center of the bracket 370, a shaft sleeve is  provided for receiving shaft 334, such as with a press fit or  other mounting technique Such that the sleeve and bracket  rotate with the shaft 334. The shoes can be bearings or  bushings, and in this embodiment 300, four bearings 378 for  shoes 336 are mounted on the axis posts 376 on the bracket  370.   The pump tube is typically a consumable part and may be  frequently changed to avoid any possible contamination.  Given the Small size of the micropump (e.g., several milli  meters in its physical dimension and several micrometers to  hundreds of micrometers on the tube dimension), changing  such tubes may be difficult. Hence, the desirability either to  provide a detachable, disposable passive portion as  dis   \fUS RE46,217 E   25  cussed with  reference  to  FIGS. 1-13  or to  providing a  detachable and replaceable tube module 354 as shown in  FIGS. 14-18. As shown, the \u201ctube' or feed chamber is  provided by the disposable module 354 with its channel 352  and its  two tube fittings  356 for providing easy \u201ctube'  change outs while providing a desired, known flow  rate  accuracy. The tube module 354 is made in some cases from  an elastomeric material that can be squeezed or compressed  by the roller assembly 330 and its shoes 336.   The channel 353 may be a rectangular cross  section  channel built in or provided inside the tube module 354. The  wall between the channel 353 and the contact surface 352  that is contacted by the shoes 336 is preferably thin enough  so that the channel 353 can be squeezed or compressed to  reduce its  volume to create the desired pressures. The flat  and rectangular-like shape of the channel 353 makes it easier  to be squeezed. The dimensions of the channel 353 can be  designed or selected to support a specific flow rates. On both  ends of the tube module 354 there are provided two fittings  356 for quick fluidic connections with tubes (not shown)  with the channel 353 (e.g., to connect the channel to a drug  reservoir and with an administration element). In the hous  ing cover 350, there is  provided a chamber or recessed  surface to accommodate or receive the tube module 354. The  tube module 354 with the fittings 356 is plugged into the  recessed surfaces 357 in the housing cover 350 as shown in  the figures.   The peristaltic  micropump 300 provides a number of  advantages. The tube module of the micropump can be  easily changed while the accuracy is retained. The bearings  or the bushings (e.g., shoes) on the roller significantly reduce  the friction between the shoes and the tube or tube module  so that the heat generated from friction is decreased and the  lifetime of the tube is  extended. The channel in the tube  module is, in some cases, rectangular in cross sections and  this  shape makes the channel more readily compressible  (e.g., less compressive force is required). Therefore, the flow  pressure  is  increased  and  the  power  consumption  is  decreased. The motor used to rotate the roller can be either  a DC motor or a stepping  motor.  By simply applying  variable DC voltage to the motor or sophisticatedly design  ing  a stepping  motor driver and a microcontroller,  the  micropump can be automatically controlled for its operation  time and its flow rate (e.g., the micropump can readily be  used to selectively deliver a specific  volume of a drug/  Solvent mixture by controlling the timing of motor operation  and its  speed to deliver a specific flow rate through the  micropump).   FIG. 19 shows a cutaway, simplified block embodiment of  an automated and programmable transdermal drug delivery  device 400 that  can stop  dosing utilizing  a flushing  or  removal means or assembly. As shown, the device 400  includes a housing 410, a display 412, a drug reservoir 414  for storing a liquid Such as a drug formulation with a solvent  and active Substance, a micropump or other dispensing  mechanism 416, control electronics 460, an administration  reservoir 440, and a permeable membrane 450.  Further  included are a waste reservoir 420 for storing waste (e.g.,  liquid or drug formulation) removed by actuator or pump  422 that is in fluid communication with the reservoir 440.  In this embodiment, the administration reservoir 440 can  be or include a Substrate (not shown) including a plurality of  micro-passageways for the drug formulation; a substrate  formed of micro-structured and/or micro-fabricated reser  voirs;  a substrate  including  a series  of miniaturized  or  microstructured reservoirs, a Substrate including a plurality  of ducts, culverts and/or canals that may be any size, shape,   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   26  or  configuration,  and  which  may  be  micro-fabricated  through any number of techniques including etching. More  specifically, in certain embodiments where the stoppage of  permeation or dosing is desired, the active drug formulation  or solvent initially is moved from the drug reservoir 414 to  the administration reservoir 440 such as by controlled opera  tion  of the  micropump 416 by electronics  460 (e.g.,  a  controller operating to a dosing Subroutine or the like). Then  after the desired amount of time elapses to allow transdermal  absorption (which may be programmed using the display  412), the mechanism to  stop dosing, namely the second  micropump or actuator 422 is activated by the electronic  controller 460 to remove or flush the liquid or drug formu  lation and remaining Volumes of the active drug from the  administration reservoir 440 to the waste reservoir 420 to  end permeation through the membrane 450 and adjacent  skin.   In another embodiment not shown, the first micropump or  actuator 416 accomplishes both the dosing into the admin  istration reservoir 440 and the removal out of the adminis  tration  reservoir  440 into  the  waste reservoir 420 after  activation by the controller electronics 460 that responds to  dosing instructions programmed into the display 412 by the  user.  In the embodiment appearing in  FIG. 19, a second  micro pump or actuator 422 accomplishes the removal or  flushing of drug formulation out of the administration res  ervoir 440 into the waste reservoir 420 after activation by the  controller electronics 460 that responds to dosing instruc  tions programmed into the display 412 by the user in some  embodiments or is based on a stored dosing regimen or  profile in other cases.   The micropump or actuator 422 may be connected to an  additional reservoir (not shown) containing water or an  inactive  solution,  and this  reservoir  may be labeled  or  thought of as an inactive solvent reservoir (or flushing fluid  source or reservoir). The second micropump 422 (or the first  micropump 416 in  Some embodiments) then  moves the  inactive drug formulation (e.g., \u201cflushing fluid  that may be  selected  for its  inactive  characteristics,  to  inactivate  the  active substance in the delivered drug formulation, or to  otherwise better control/stop dosing) from the inactive sol  vent reservoir to the drug administration reservoir 440 to  force out or flush  the active drug formulation from the  administration reservoir 440 into the waste reservoir 420 or  into an area for evaporation (not shown).   In another embodiment, an air or gas cartridge can be  utilized to force the active drug compound from the admin  istration reservoir 440 into the waste reservoir 420 or into an  area for evaporation pursuant to activation by the controller  electronics 460 that responds to  dosing instructions pro  grammed into the display 412 by the user. It is important to  note that when the administration reservoir 440, which acts  as the administration depot for the transdermal absorption, is  not an absorbent sheet or wick material but a micro-duct or  culver or liquid passageway, it has at least one side, or a  series of holes or openings (or otherwise) that allows the  drug formulation to come into  contact with the skin for  transdermal absorption, either by passing through a mem  brane  on  skin  450  or  otherwise  to  reach  the  skin  for  transdermal absorption.  Such an administration reservoir  440 may take many forms to practice the invention Such as  a Substrate comprising one or a plurality of micro-passage  ways for the drug formulation; a substrate of micro-struc  tured and/or micro-fabricated reservoirs; a substrate includ  ing a series of miniaturized or micro-structured reservoirs, a  substrate formed with a plurality of ducts, culverts, and/or  canals that may be take any size, shape or configuration, and   \fUS RE46,217 E   27  which may be  micro-fabricated  through any  number of  techniques including etching. This administration reservoir  440 in whatever form it may take may be filled using the  micro-pump or actuator 416 to allow for the transdermal  absorption, then flushed or emptied, as described above, so  as to stop or slow drug delivery by removing the active drug  from a position where it can access the skin for transdermal  absorption.   As discussed above, a heating  element may also  be  present (e.g., as shown in FIG.9) whether directly formed in  the substrate of the administration reservoir 440, provided as  a separate component of the administration reservoir 440  either at the top, bottom, or side of the reservoir. This heating  element serves  to  increase  the  temperature  of the  skin  Surface which increases the permeation of the active com  pound through the skin. This heating element aids in the  movement of liquids through the passageways that may be  provided in the administration reservoir 440. The heating  element may also aid in the evaporation of the drug formu  lation where evaporation is  a desired method to dry the  administration area 440 to stop dosing by causing evapora  tion. This heating element may be programmed to automati  cally  heat the skin at precise preprogrammed times  for  precise timing of permeation enhancement and/or precise  timing of stopping of dosing by inducing evaporation. The  heating element may be configured with a plurality of flow  paths for vapor or evaporated portions of the liquid (such as  solvent vapor) that facilitates relatively uniform or at least  well distributed flow away from the reservoir.   A further embodiment that  facilitates  the stopping of  dosing does not use the first, or introduce a second, micro  pump or actuator to flush or empty the drug formulation  from the administration reservoir 440. Instead, evaporation  of the drug formulation or more specifically, the solvent, is  induced so as to dry the administration reservoir 440 which  will result in the stopping of dosing. It is well known that a  dry skin/administration reservoir interface is not conducive  to transdermal permeation. In this embodiment, the admin  istration reservoir has vents or other access either to  the  environment for evaporation, or immediate access by being  in close proximity to chamber containing a desiccant. This  desiccant chamber acts to induce evaporation and captures  the solvent vapors to dry the interface and stop dosing. In  this embodiment, the heating element, which may be pro  grammed via the display 412 or with stored software (e.g.,  a dosing profile) to heat at a certain time heats the admin  istration reservoir 440 and/or skin and/or the whole device  400 which increases significantly evaporation and speeds up  the process  which in  turn  stops  dosing quickly.  As an  alternative to heat, a gas or air cartridge can be present to  automatically,  pursuant to  a programmed Schedule pro  grammed into the display 412, blow air or gas onto the  administration area to rapidly dry the administration reser  voir 440 and stop dosing.   Although the invention has been described and illustrated  with a certain degree of particularity, it is understood that the  present disclosure has been made only by way of example,  and that numerous changes in the combination and arrange  ment of parts can be resorted to by those skilled in the art  without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention,  as hereinafter claimed. For example, the devices may also  include components other than heating elements to enhance  drug diffusion Such as components to implement iontopho  resis, Sonophoresis, and/or mechanical or chemical perme  ation enhancers.   5   10   15   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60   65   28   We claim:  1.

No. 61/204,714, filed Jan. 9.  2009. The entire contents of each above-mentioned appli  cation are herein incorporated by reference in their entire  ties.   TECHNICAL FIELD  0002  The present invention relates to organic chemistry,  formulation chemistry, and protein  chemistry applied to  pharmaceutical research and development. Aspects of the  present invention provide highly concentrated drug particle  formulations, Suspension formulations comprising Such par  ticle formulations, devices comprising Such suspension for  mulations, and uses thereof for the treatment of diseases or  conditions.   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  0003  Drugs, including proteins, peptides, and polypep  tides tend to degrade over time in aqueous Solution, that is,  they are typically unstable in aqueous Solution. Because of  this  chemical instability,  drugs in  solution are often  not  Suitable for long-term storage or use in drug delivery devices  that provide prolonged delivery of a drug.  Furthermore,  drugs with short in vivo half-lives are particularly difficult to  formulate for storage and delivery. Drug formulations con  tinue to suffer from important drawbacks that limit their use,  especially with respect to their method of delivery (e.g.,  Subcutaneous or intravenous injection) and in the ability to  be administered in Sufficient therapeutic dosages. Improve  ments  are  needed in  drug formulation  and delivery  to  improve patient compliance and expand drug availability.  0004  Carriers in which drugs do not dissolve but rather  are suspended have been shown to improve chemical sta  bility (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,972,370 and 5,904,935). Fur  thermore, it can be beneficial to Suspend the beneficial agent  in a carrier when the agent exhibits low solubility in the  desired vehicle. However, Suspensions can have poor physi  cal stability due to settling, chemical instability, and aggre  gation of the Suspended beneficial agent. A further problem  is the ability to achieve the necessary concentration of drug  in the vehicle to, for example, provide prolonged delivery.  The problems with non-aqueous carriers tend to be exacer  bated as the concentration of drug is increased.  0005.  Several approaches have been taken  to  achieve  prolonged delivery  of a drug at  a controlled  rate.  For  example, Brodbeck, et al., have described depot gel com  positions that can be injected into a desired location and  provide sustained release of a drug (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,673,  767; 6,468,961; 6,331,311; and 6,130,200).  0006  Implantable  infusion  pumps  have  also  been  described for delivering drugs by intravenous, intraarterial,  intrathecal,  intraperitoneal,  and epidural  pathways.  Such   pumps are typically Surgically inserted Subcutaneously into  a pocket of tissue in the lower abdomen provide for con  trolled delivery of a drug. A number of systems for insulin  delivery,  pain  management,  and  chemotherapy  delivery  have  been  described  (e.g.,  Health  Services/Technology  Assessment Text (HSTAT). External and Implantable Infu  sion Pumps, by Ann A. Graham, C.R.N.A., M.P.H., Thomas  V.  Holohan,  M.D.,  Health  Technology  Review,  No.  7,  Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Office of  Health Technology Assessment, January 1994).  0007  Another approach for prolonged delivery of a drug  uses  osmotic  delivery  devices.  Such  a  device  can  be  implanted into a subject to release a drug in a controlled  manner for a predetermined administration period. In gen  eral,  these  devices  operate  by imbibing  fluid  from the  outside environment and releasing amounts of the drug  corresponding to the imbibed fluid. An example of one Such  osmotic delivery device is the VIADURR (ALZA Corpo  ration.  Mountain View,  Calif.)  device.  The VIADUR(R)  device is  a titanium  implant drug-delivery system using  DUROS(R) (ALZA Corporation,  Mountain View,  Calif.)  technology  to  manage  the  symptoms  associated  with  advanced (stage 4) prostate cancer by delivering leuprolide  acetate. Treatment using the VIADUR(R) device reduces the  amount of testosterone produced and circulated in a Sub  ject's  body  and provides  a  continuous  therapy  for  12  months.  0008  For prolonged delivery of a drug, dosing durations  of up to a year are desirable. Such long-term storage of drugs  at physiological temperatures presents  many challenges.  One such challenge is that settling of the drug in a liquid  formulation can occur, which can result in heterogeneity of  the drug in the drug suspension. Another challenge is the  ability  to  obtain  a  suspension  formulation  that  can be  reliably pumped from a delivery device for prolonged deliv  ery. A third challenge is the ability to deliver high doses of  drug over time when constrained by the typically small  volumes available in implantable delivery devices for stor  age of drug. For example, implant reservoirs are generally  on the order of 25-250 ul.  0009.  The above-described  devices  and  formulations  have been useful for delivering drugs to Subjects. Although  these devices have found application for human and veteri  nary  purposes,  there  remains  a  need  for  formulations,  devices, and methods of administration that are capable of  delivering drug at  desired therapeutic concentrations  for  prolonged duration and that provide drug stability  over  extended periods of time. The highly concentrated drug  particle formulations of the present invention provide solu  tions  to  many of the challenges  and problems outlined  above. The present invention provides  needed improve  ments in,  for example, drug formulation and delivery to  improve longer duration, patient compliance, types of drugs  available for use, and drug stability.   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  0010.  The present invention generally relates to highly  concentrated drug particle formulations and Suspension for  mulations comprising a highly concentrated drug particle  formulation and a suspension vehicle, as well as devices  comprising Such formulations,  methods of making Such  formulations and devices, and methods of use thereof.  0011.

In another embodi  ment, the drug comprises about 40 wt % to about 75 wt %  and the one or more additional component comprises about  60 wt % to about 25 wt %.  0012  A particle formulation of the present invention can  include components in  addition to  the  drug component.  Examples of the one or more additional component include,  but are not limited to, antioxidant, carbohydrate, and buffer.  In one embodiment, the ratio of drug:antioxidant:carbohy  drate:buffer is between about 2-20:1-5:1-5: 1-10. Examples  of antioxidant include,  but are  not limited to  cysteine,  methionine, tryptophan, and mixtures thereof.

The term \u201cviscosity  as used herein typically refers  to a value determined from the ratio of shear stress to shear  rate  (see,  e.g.,  Considine,  D.  M. & Considine, G.  D.,  Encyclopedia of Chemistry, 4th  Edition,  Van  Nostrand,  Reinhold, N.Y., 1984) essentially as follows:   (Equation 1)   where F/A-shear stress (force per unit area),  p a proportionality constant (viscosity), and   0.052  0053  0.054  V/L=the velocity per layer thickness (shear rate).  0055  From this relationship, the ratio of shear stress to  shear rate defines viscosity. Measurements of shear stress  and shear rate are typically determined using parallel plate  rheometry performed under selected conditions (e.g., a tem  perature of about 37\u00b0 C.). Other methods for the determi  nation of viscosity  include,  measurement of a kinematic  Viscosity using a viscometer, for example, a Cannon-Fenske  viscometer, an Ubbelohde viscometer for the Cannon-Fen  ske opaque Solution, or a Ostwald Viscometer.

The term \u201cosmotic delivery device\u201d as used herein  typically refers to a device used for delivery of one or more  beneficial agent (e.g.,  an incretin  mimetic) to  a subject,  wherein the  device comprises, for example, a reservoir  (made, e.g.,  from a titanium alloy) having a lumen that  contains  a Suspension  formulation  (e.g.,  comprising an  incretin  mimetic) and an  osmotic agent  formulation. A  piston assembly positioned in the lumen isolates the Sus  pension formulation from the osmotic agent formulation. A  semipermeable membrane positioned at a first distal end of  the reservoir adjacent the osmotic agent formulation, as well  as a flow modulator (which defines a delivery orifice through  which the suspension formulation exits the device) that is  positioned at a second distal end of the reservoir adjacent the  Suspension  formulation.  Typically,  the  osmotic  delivery  device is implanted within the Subject, for example, Subcu  taneously (e.g., in the inside, outside, or back of the upper  arm;  or in the abdominal area).  An exemplary osmotic  delivery  device  is  the  DUROS(R)  (ALZA Corporation,  Mountain View, Calif.) delivery device.  0059.  The term  \u201ccontinuous delivery\u201d  as  used herein  typically refers to a Substantially continuous release of drug  from  an  osmotic  delivery  device.  For  example,  the  DUROSR delivery device releases drug at a predetermined  rate based on the principle of osmosis. Extracellular fluid  enters  the  DUROSR) device through  the semipermeable  membrane directly into the osmotic engine that expands to  drive the piston at a slow and consistent rate of travel.  Movement of the piston forces the drug formulation to be  released through the orifice of the diffusion moderator. Thus  release of the drug from the osmotic delivery device is  continuous at a slow, controlled, consistent rate.  0060.  The term  \u201csubstantial  steady-state  delivery\u201d  as  used herein typically refers to delivery of a drug at or near  a target level over a defined period of time, wherein the  amount of the drug being delivered from an osmotic device  is substantially zero-order delivery.   2.O.O GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE  INVENTION   0061  Before describing the present invention in detail, it  is  to be understood that this  invention  is  not limited to  particular types of drug delivery, particular types of drug  delivery  devices,  particular  sources  of drugs,  particular  Solvents, particular polymers, and the like, as use of Such  particulars may be selected in view of the teachings of the  present specification.

Beneficial  agents and their dosage unit amounts are known to the prior  art in Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of  Therapeutics, 11th Ed., (2005), McGraw Hill; Remington's  Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., (1995), Mack Publishing   \fUS 2017/01 19854 A1   May 4, 2017   Co.; and Martin\u2019s Physical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical  Sciences,  1.00  edition  (2005),  Lippincott  Williams  &  Wilkins.  Typically,  for an osmotic delivery  system,  the  Volume of the chamber comprising the drug formulation is  between about 100 ul to about 1000 ul,  more preferably  between about 140 ul and about 200 ul. In one embodiment,  the Volume of the chamber comprising the drug formulation  is about 150 ul.  0102  Highly concentrated drug particle formulations of  the invention are preferably chemically and physically stable  for at  least  about  1  month, at  least  about  1.5  months,  preferably at least about 3 months, preferably at least about  6 months, more preferably at least about 9 months, more  preferably at least about 12 months at delivery temperature.  The delivery temperature is typically normal human body  temperature, for example, about 37\u00b0 C., or slightly higher,  for example, about 40\u00b0 C. Further, highly concentrated drug  particle formulations of the present invention are preferably  chemically and physically stable for at least about 3 months,  preferably at least about 6 months, more preferably at least  about  12  months,  at  storage  temperature.  Examples of  storage temperatures include refrigeration temperature, for  example, about 5\u00b0 C., or room temperature, for example,  about 25\u00b0 C.  0103)  A highly concentrated drug particle formulation  may be considered chemically stable if less than about 25%,  preferably less than about 20%, more preferably less than  about 15%, more preferably less than about 10%, and more  preferably less than about 5% breakdown products of the  drug particles are formed after about 3 months, preferably  after about 6 months, preferably after about 12 months at  delivery temperature and after about 6 months, after about  12 months, and preferably after about 24 months at storage  temperature.  0104.  A highly concentrated drug particle formulation  may be considered physically stable if less than about 10%,  preferably less than about 5%, more preferably less than  about 3%, more preferably less than 1% aggregates of the  drug are formed after about 3 months, preferably after about  6 months, at delivery temperature and about 6 months,  preferably about 12 months, at storage temperature.  0105  Example 3A presents exemplary data related to the  stability of the highly concentrated drug particle formula  tions of the present invention.  0106  When the drug in  the highly concentrated drug  particle formulation is a protein, the protein solution is kept  in a frozen condition and lyophilized or spray dried to a solid  state. Tg (glass transition temperature) may be one factor to  consider in achieving stable compositions of protein. While  not intending to be bound by any particular theory, the  theory of formation of a high Tg amorphous solid to stabilize  peptides,  polypeptides,  or proteins  has been utilized  in  pharmaceutical industry. Generally, if an amorphous Solid  has a higher Tg, such as 100\u00b0 C., proteins will not have  mobility when stored at room temp or even at 40\u00b0C. because  the storage temperature is below the Tg. Calculations using  molecular information have shown that if a glass transition  temperature is above a storage temperature of 50\u00b0 C. that  there  is  Zero  mobility  for  molecules.  Zero  mobility  of  molecules correlates with better stability. Tg is also depen  dent on the  moisture  level  in  the  product formulation.  Generally,  the  more moisture,  the  lower the Tg of the  composition.   0107  Accordingly, in some aspects of the present inven  tion,  excipients  with higher Tg may be included in the  protein  formulation  to  improve  stability,  for  example,  sucrose (Tg-75\u00b0 C.) and trehalose (Tg  110\u00b0 C.). Preferably,  particle formulations are formable into particles using pro  cesses  Such as  spray  drying,  lyophilization,  desiccation,  freeze-drying, milling, granulation, ultrasonic drop creation,  crystallization, precipitation, or other techniques available in  the art for forming particles from a mixture of components.  The particles are preferably substantially uniform in shape  and size.  0108.  A typical  spray  dry  process  may include,  for  example, loading a spray Solution containing a small mol  ecule or protein, for example, an incretin  mimetic (e.g.,  exenatide;  Example 1),  and stabilizing excipients into  a  sample chamber. The sample chamber is typically  main  tained at a desired temperature, for example, refrigeration to  room temperature. Refrigeration generally promotes stabil  ity  of the  drug.  A solution,  emulsion,  or Suspension is  introduced to the spray dryer where the fluid is atomized into  droplets. Droplets can be formed by use of a rotary atomizer,  pressure nozzle, pneumatic nozzle, or Sonic nozzle. The mist  of droplets is immediately brought into contact with a drying  gas in a drying chamber. The drying gas removes solvent  from the droplets and carries the particles into a collection  chamber.  In  spray  drying,  factors  that  can  affect  yield  include, but are not limited to, localized charges on particles  (which may promote adhesion of the particles to the spray  dryer) and aerodynamics of the particles (which may make  it difficult to collect the particles). In general, yield of the  spray dry process depends in part on the particle formula  tion.  0109.  In one embodiment of the present invention, the  particles are sized such that they can be delivered via an  implantable osmotic drug delivery device. Uniform shape  and size of the particles typically helps to provide a consis  tent and uniform rate of release from such a delivery device,  however, a particle preparation having a non-normal particle  size distribution profile may also be used. For example, in a  typical implantable osmotic delivery device having a deliv  ery orifice, the size of the particles is less than about 30%,  more preferably is less than about 20%, more preferably is  less than about than 10%, of the diameter of the delivery  orifice. In an embodiment of the particle formulation for use  with an osmotic  delivery  system,  wherein  the  delivery  orifice diameter of the implant is  about 0.5 mm, particle  sizes may be, for example, less than about 150 microns to  about 50 microns. In an embodiment of the particle formu  lation for use with an osmotic delivery system, wherein the  delivery orifice diameter of the implant is about 0.1  mm,  particle  sizes  may be,  for example, less  than about 30  microns to about 10 microns. In one embodiment, the orifice  is about 0.25 mm (250 microns) and the particle size is about  2 microns to about 5 microns.  0110  Typically, the particles of the particle formulations  of the present invention when incorporated in a Suspension  vehicle do not settle in less than about 3 months, preferably  do not settle in less than about 6 months, more preferably do  not settle in less than about 12 months, more preferably do  not settle in less than about 24 months at delivery tempera  ture, and most preferably do not settle in less than about 36  months at delivery temperature. The Suspension vehicles  typically have a viscosity of between about 5,000 to about  30,000 poise,  preferably  between about 8,000 to  about   \fUS 2017/01 19854 A1   May 4, 2017   25,000 poise,  more preferably between about  10,000 to  about 20,000 poise.  In one embodiment, the suspension  vehicle has a viscosity of about 15,000 poise, plus or minus  about 3,000 poise.  Generally speaking, smaller particles  tend to have a lower settling rate in  Viscous Suspension  vehicles than larger particles. Accordingly, micron- to nano  sized particles are typically desirable. Based on simulation  modeling studies, in  Viscous Suspension formulation par  ticles of about 2 microns to about 10 microns of the present  invention are not expected to settle for at least 20 years at  room temperature. In an embodiment of the particle formu  lation of the present invention, for use in an implantable  osmotic delivery device, comprises particles of sizes less  than about 50 microns, more preferably less than about 10  microns, more preferably in a range from about 2 to about  7 microns.  0111.  In one embodiment, a highly concentrated drug  particle formulation of the present invention comprises one  or more drug, as described above, and one or more addi  tional component (e.g., one or more stabilizers). Stabilizers  may be, for example, carbohydrate, antioxidant, amino acid,  buffer, inorganic compound, or Surfactant. The amounts of  stabilizers  and buffer in  the particle formulation can be  determined experimentally based on the activities of the  stabilizers and buffers and the desired characteristics of the  formulation. Typically, the amount of carbohydrate in the  formulation is determined by aggregation concerns. In gen  eral, the carbohydrate level should not be too high so as to  avoid promoting crystal growth in the presence of water due  to  excess carbohydrate unbound to  drug. Typically,  the  amount of antioxidant in the formulation is determined by  oxidation concerns, while the amount of amino acid in the  formulation is  determined by oxidation  concerns and/or  formability of particles during spray drying. Typically, the  amount of buffer in the formulation is determined by pre  processing concerns, stability concerns, and formability of  particles during spray drying. Buffer may be required to  stabilize the drug during processing, e.g., Solution prepara  tion and spray drying, when all excipients are solubilized.  0112  Examples of carbohydrates that may be included in  the particle  formulation include, but are  not limited to,  monosaccharides (e.g.,  fructose,  maltose, galactose, glu  cose, D-mannose, and Sorbose), disaccharides (e.g., lactose,  Sucrose, trehalose, and cellobiose), polysaccharides (e.g.,  raffinose, melezitose, maltodextrins, dextrans, and starches),  and alditols (acyclic polyols; e.g., mannitol, Xylitol, maltitol,  lactitol. Xylitol Sorbitol, pyranosyl Sorbitol, and myoinsitol).  Preferred carbohydrates include disaccharides and/or non  reducing Sugars, such as Sucrose, trehalose, and raffinose.  0113.  Examples of antioxidants that may be included in  the particle  formulation include, but are  not limited to,  methionine,  ascorbic  acid,  sodium thiosulfate,  catalase,  platinum,    acid  (EDTA), citric  acid, cysteins, thioglycerol, thioglycolic acid, thiosorbitol,  butylated hydroxanisol, butylated hydroxyltoluene, and pro  pyl gallate. Further, amino acids that readily oxidize can be  used as antioxidants, for example, cysteine, methionine, and  tryptophan. A preferred antioxidant is methionine.  0114  Examples of amino acids that may be included in  the particle  formulation include, but are  not limited to,  arginine, methionine, glycine, histidine, alanine, L-leucine,  glutamic  acid,  iso-leucine,  L-threonine,  2-phenylamine,  valine, norvaline, praline, phenylalanine, trytophan, serine,  asparagines, cysteine, tyrosine, lysine, and norleucine. Pre   ferred amino acids include those that readily oxidize, e.g.,  cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan.  0115  Examples of buffers that may be included in the  particle formulation include, but are not limited to, citrate,  histidine, Succinate, phosphate, maleate, tris, acetate, carbo  hydrate, and gly-gly. Preferred buffers include citrate, his  tidine, Succinate, and tris.  0116  Examples of inorganic compounds that  may be  included in  the particle formulation include, but are not  limited to, NaCl, NaSO4, NaHCO, KC1, KHPO4, CaCl,  and MgCl2.  0117.  In addition, the particle formulation may include  other excipients, such as Surfactants and salts. Examples of  surfactants include, but are not limited to, Polysorbate 20,  Polysorbate 80, PLURONICR) (BASF Corporation, Mount  Olive,  N.J.)  F68,  and  sodium  dodecyl  sulfate  (SDS).  Examples of salts include, but are not limited to, sodium  chloride, calcium chloride, and magnesium chloride.  0118  All components included in the particle formula  tion  are  typically  acceptable  for pharmaceutical  use  in  mammals, in particular, in humans.  0119  Table 1  below presents examples of particle for  mulation  composition ranges for particles  comprising a  protein (range values are approximate, e.g., in the \u201cRange'  column, protein is present at about 25 wt % to about 80 wt  %). Although preferred embodiments include protein, car  bohydrate, antioxidant and/or amino acid, and buffer, some  embodiments may, for example, include only protein and  carbohydrate; protein and antioxidant; protein and buffer;  protein, carbohydrate and antioxidant; protein, carbohydrate  and buffer;  protein, antioxidant, and buffer;  wherein the  protein wt % range is as given in Table 1 and the remaining  wt % is made up by the selected additional component(s).  Accordingly, in some embodiments the particle formulation  may comprise selected components and in other embodi  ments consist essentially of selected components. Further, as  discussed above, the particle formulations of the present  invention may comprise further excipients and/or stabilizers.  Preferred  embodiments of the present  invention  consist  essentially of protein(s), in the approximate wt % ranges  presented in Table 1, plus selected Stabilizers (e.g., carbo  hydrate and/or antioxidant and/or amino acid and/or buffer,  as well as combinations thereof) to bring the total wt % to  essentially 100%. Small molecules may also be formulated  as described herein. Typically the wt % of a selected small  molecule(s) is in the same ranges as presented in Table 1 for  protein.   TABLE 1.

Several exem  plary embodiments of the highly concentrated drug particle  formulations  of the  present  invention  are  set  forth  in  Example 1, wherein the drug is a protein.  0121  Table 2 below presents examples of particle for  mulation composition ranges for particles  comprising an  incretin mimetic, such as, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP  1), a derivative of GLP-1 (e.g., GLP-1 (7-36)amide), or an  analogue of GLP-1, exenatide, a derivative of exenatide, or  an analogue of exenatide.  The description  of particular  embodiments described  for Table  1  also  applies  to  the  formulations described in Table 2.   TABLE 2   Preferred  Range  (% by weight)  (% by weight)  (% by weight)   Range   More  Preferred  Range   O.1 to 99.9   1 to 60   S to SO   1 to 99  O.1 to 99   S to 95  S to 70   20 to 80  S to SO   O.1 to 99   S to 70   S to SO   Particle loading in  Suspension  formulations  In Particles   Protein  Carbohydrate and/or  Antioxidant andfor  amino acid  Buffer   0122)  Within these weight percent ranges for components  of the particle formulation, some preferred component ratios  are as follows: drug to one or more additional component  (e.g., stabilizer(s)) at ratios of 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 2.5:1,  5:1, 10:1, 16:1, and 20:1, preferably between about 1:4 to  10:1 (i.e., about 1-10:4-1), or preferably between about 1:3  to 5:1 (i.e.,  1-5:3-1). The present invention also includes  ranges corresponding to  all  of these  drug to  additional  components (e.g., stabilizer(s)) ratios, for example, between  about 1:1 to 2:1 (i.e.,  1-2: 1) between about 1:4 and about  20:1 (i.e., about 1-20:4-1), between about 1:4 to about 16:1  (i.e., about 1-16:4-1), between about 1:3 to about 10:1 (i.e.,  about 1-10:3-1), between about 1:2 to about 20:1 (i.e., about  1-20:2-1), and so on.  0123.  Accordingly, in one aspect the present invention  includes a particle formulation comprising about 25 wt % to  about 80 wt %, preferably about 40 wt % to about 75 wt %,  of drug; and about 75% wt % to about 20% wt %, preferably  about 60% wt % to  about 25% wt % of one or more  additional component, for example, stabilizers selected from  the group consisting of antioxidant, carbohydrate, and buf  fer, wherein the ratio of drug:antioxidant:carbohydrate:buf  fer is between about 2-20:1-5:1-5:1-10, preferably between  about 5-10: 1-2.5:1-2.5:1-5. Typically the particle formula  tions of the present invention comprise less than about 10 wt  %, preferably less than about 5 wt %, residual moisture.  0.124.  An example of a particle formulation of the present  invention includes, but is not limited to, the protein a drug,  methionine an antioxidant,  Sucrose a carbohydrate,  and  citrate a buffer,  wherein the protein constitutes  between  about 40 wt % to about 70 wt % of the particle formulation  and the ratio of protein to additional components is between   about 1:2 and 3:1  (i.e.,  about 1-3:2-1). Specific proteins  exemplified below include an interferon and an incretin  mimetic (Example 1).  0.125.  In summary, a selected drug or combination of  drugs is formulated into a dried powder in Solid state, which  preserves maximum chemical and biological stability of the  drug.  The particle  formulation  offers  long-term  storage  stability at high temperature and thus allows delivery to a  subject of stable and biologically effective drug for extended  periods of time. In one embodiment, peptides, polypeptides,  or proteins in highly concentrated drug particle formulations  of the present invention are stabile for transportation and/or  storage without the requirement of refrigeration or freezing.  In the absence of the stabilization provided by the highly  concentrated drug particle formulations of the present inven  tion, peptides, polypeptides, or proteins may be unstable for  transporting and/or storing or may otherwise require cold or  frozen conditions for transporting and storing. For example,  a highly concentrated drug particle formulation placed into  a sterile vial or ampoule. At the time of use, the particle  formulations of the present invention can be quickly recon  stituted with, for example, water-for-injection to create a  highly concentrated aqueous solution just prior to adminis  tering a bolus injection to a subject.  0.126  Particle size distribution of the dry particle powder  can be well  controlled (0.1  micron  to  20 micron), for  example, by using the methods of spray drying or lyophiliza  tion to prepare the particle formulations. The process param  eters for formation of the dry powder are optimal to produce  particles with desired particle size distribution, density, and  Surface area.  I0127.  The selected excipients and buffer in the highly  concentrated drug particle formulation may provide,  for  example, the following functions: density modification of  the dry powder; preservation of the drug chemical stability;  maintenance of the drugs physical stability (e.g., high glass  transition temperature, and avoiding phase to phase transi  tion),  producing homogenous dispersions  in  Suspension;  modification  of hydrophobicity  and/or hydrophilicity  to  manipulate dry powder Solubility in selected Solvents; and  manipulation of pH during processing and maintenance of  pH in the product (for solubility and stability).   3.2.0 Vehicle Formulations and Suspension  Formulations  I0128.  In one aspect of the present invention, the suspen  sion vehicle provides a stable environment in  which the  highly concentrated drug particle formulation is dispersed.  The highly  concentrated  drug particle  formulations  are  chemically and physically stable (as described above) in the  Suspension vehicle. The Suspension vehicle typically com  prises one or more polymer and one or more solvent that  form a solution of Sufficient viscosity to uniformly Suspend  the particles comprising the drug. The Suspension vehicle  may comprise further components, including, but not limited  to,  Surfactants,  antioxidants,  and/or  other  compounds  soluble in the vehicle.  I0129.  The viscosity of the suspension vehicle is typically  Sufficient to prevent the highly concentrated drug particle  formulation from settling during storage and use in a method  of delivery, for example, in an implantable drug delivery  device. The suspension vehicle is biodegradable in that the  Suspension  vehicle  disintegrates  or breaks down over a  period of time in response to a biological environment, while   \fUS 2017/01 19854 A1   May 4, 2017   the highly concentrated drug particle is  dissolved in the  biological environment and the active pharmaceutical ingre  dient in the particle is absorbed.  0130.  The solvent in which the polymer is dissolved may  affect characteristics of the Suspension formulation, Such as  the behavior of the highly concentrated drug particle for  mulation  during  storage.  A solvent  may be selected  in  combination with a polymer so that the resulting Suspension  vehicle exhibits phase separation  upon contact with the  aqueous environment. In some embodiments of the inven  tion, the solvent may be selected in combination with the  polymer so that the resulting Suspension vehicle exhibits  phase separation upon contact with the aqueous environment  having less than approximately about 10% water.  0131  The solvent may be an acceptable solvent that is  not miscible with water. The solvent may also be selected so  that the polymer is soluble in the solvent at high concen  trations, such as at a polymer concentration of greater than  about 30%. Examples of solvents useful in the practice of  the present invention include, but are not limited to, lauryl  alcohol,  benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, lauryl  lactate,  decanol (also called decyl alcohol), ethylhexyl lactate, and  long chain (Cs to C) aliphatic alcohols, esters, or mixtures  thereof. The solvent used in the suspension vehicle may be  \u201cdry,\u201d  in  that  it  has a low  moisture content.  Preferred  solvents for use in formulation of the suspension vehicle  include lauryl lactate, lauryl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, and  mixtures thereof.  0132  Examples of polymers for formulation of the sus  pension vehicles of the present invention include, but are not  limited to,  a polyester (e.g.,  polylactic  acid or polylac  ticpolyglycolic acid);  a polymer comprising pyrrolidones  (e.g.,  polyvinylpyrrolidone  (PVP)  having  a  molecular  weight ranging from approximately 2,000 to approximately  1,000,000); ester or ether of an unsaturated alcohol (e.g.,  vinyl  acetate);  polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block  copolymer, or mixtures thereof.  In one embodiment, the  polymer is  PVP having a molecular weight of 2,000 to  1,000,000. In a preferred embodiment the polymer is poly  vinylpyrrolidone  K-17 (typically  having an approximate  average molecular weight range of 7,900-10,800). Polyvi  nylpyrrolidone can be characterized by its  K-value (e.g.,  K-17), which is a viscosity index. The polymer used in the  Suspension vehicle may include one or more different poly  mers or may include different grades of a single polymer.  The polymer used in the Suspension vehicle may also be dry  or have a low moisture content.  Generally speaking, a suspension vehicle accord  0.133  ing to the present invention may vary in composition based  on the desired performance characteristics. In one embodi  ment, the Suspension vehicle may comprise about 40 wt %  to about 80 wt % polymer(s) and about 20 wt % to about 60  wt % solvent(s).  Preferred embodiments of a suspension  vehicle include vehicles formed of polymer(s) and solvent(s)  combined at the following ratios: about 25 wt % solvent and  about 75 wt % polymer; about 50 wt % solvent and about 50  wt % polymer; and about 75 wt % solvent and about 25 wt  % polymer. Accordingly, in Some embodiments the Suspen  sion vehicle may comprise selected components and in other  embodiments consist essentially of selected components.  0134.  The suspension vehicle  may exhibit Newtonian  behavior. The suspension vehicle is typically formulated to  provide a viscosity that maintains a uniform dispersion of  the particle formulation for a predetermined period of time.   This helps facilitate making a suspension formulation tai  lored to provide controlled delivery of the drug contained in  the highly concentrated drug particle formulation. The vis  cosity of the Suspension vehicle may vary depending on the  desired application, the size and type of the particle formu  lation, and the loading of the particle formulation in the  Suspension vehicle. The Viscosity of the Suspension vehicle  may be varied by altering the type or relative amount of the  Solvent or polymer used.  0.135  The suspension vehicle may have a viscosity rang  ing from about 100 poise to about 1,000,000 poise, prefer  ably from about  1,000 poise to about 100,000 poise.  In  preferred embodiments, the Suspension vehicles typically  have a viscosity, at 33\u00b0C., of between about 5,000 to about  30,000 poise,  preferably  between about 8,000 to  about  25,000 poise,  more preferably between about  10,000 to  about 20,000 poise.  In one embodiment, the suspension  vehicle has a viscosity of about 15,000 poise, plus or minus  about 3,000 poise, at 33\u00b0C. The viscosity may be measured  at 33\u00b0C., at a shear rate of 10/sec, using a parallel plate  rheometer.  0.136  The suspension vehicle may exhibit phase separa  tion when contacted with the aqueous environment; how  ever, typically the suspension vehicle exhibits substantially  no phase  separation  as  a function  of temperature.  For  example, at a temperature ranging from approximately 0\u00b0C.  to approximately 70\u00b0 C. and upon temperature cycling. Such  as cycling from 4\u00b0C. to 370\u00b0 C. to 4\u00b0C., the suspension  vehicle typically exhibits no phase separation.  0.137  The suspension vehicle may be prepared by com  bining the polymer and the solvent under dry conditions,  Such as in a dry box. The polymer and solvent may be  combined at an elevated temperature, such as from approxi  mately 40\u00b0 C. to approximately 70\u00b0 C., and allowed to  liquefy and form the single phase. The ingredients may be  blended under vacuum to remove air bubbles produced from  the dry ingredients. The ingredients may be combined using  a conventional mixer, such as a dual helix blade or similar  mixer, set at a speed of approximately 40 rpm. However,  higher speeds may also be used to mix the ingredients. Once  a liquid Solution of the ingredients is achieved, the Suspen  sion vehicle may be cooled to room temperature. Differential  scanning calorimetry (DSC) may be used to verify that the  Suspension vehicle is a single phase. Further, the compo  nents of the vehicle (e.g., the solvent and/or the polymer)  may be treated  to  substantially  reduce  or  substantially  remove peroxides (e.g., by treatment with methionine; see,  e.g.,  U.S.,  Patent  Application  Publication  No.  2007  0027105).  0.138.  The highly concentrated drug particle formulation  is  added to the Suspension vehicle to form a Suspension  formulation. In some embodiments the Suspension formu  lation  may comprise a highly concentrated drug particle  formulation and a suspension vehicle and in other embodi  ments consist  essentially  of a highly  concentrated drug  particle formulation and a suspension vehicle.  0.139.  The suspension formulation may be prepared by  dispersing the particle formulation in the Suspension vehicle.  The suspension  vehicle  may be heated and the particle  formulation  added to  the  suspension  vehicle  under dry  conditions. The ingredients may be mixed under vacuum at  an elevated temperature, such as from about 40\u00b0C. to about  70\u00b0 C. The ingredients may be mixed at a sufficient speed,  such as from about 40 rpm to about 120 rpm, and for a   \fUS 2017/01 19854 A1   May 4, 2017   Sufficient amount of time, such as about 15 minutes, to  achieve a uniform dispersion of the particle formulation in  the suspension vehicle. The mixer may be a dual helix blade  or other suitable  mixer.  The resulting  mixture  may be  removed from the mixer, sealed in a dry container to prevent  water from contaminating the Suspension formulation, and  allowed to cool to room temperature before further use, for  example, loading into an implantable drug delivery device,  unit dose container, or multiple-dose container.  0140.  The suspension formulation typically has an over  all moisture content of less than about 10 wt %, preferably  less than about 5 wt %, and more preferably less than about  4 wt %.  0141.  The suspension formulations of the present inven  tion  are exemplified herein below with  reference  to  an  incretin mimetic and an interferon (Example 2). Further, the  stability of drug particle formulations suspended in a vehicle  that  is  biocompatible,  single-phase,  and non-aqueous is  described in Example 3B. These examples are not intended  to be limiting.  0142.  In  Summary, the components of the Suspension  vehicle provide biocompatibility. Components of the sus  pension vehicle offer Suitable chemico-physical properties  to  form stable  Suspensions  of highly  concentrated drug  particle formulations. These properties include, but are not  limited to, the following: viscosity of the Suspension; purity  of the vehicle; residual moisture of the vehicle; density of  the vehicle; compatibility with the dry powders; compat  ibility  with implantable devices; molecular weight of the  polymer; stability of the vehicle; and hydrophobicity and  hydrophilicity  of the  vehicle.  These properties  can  be  manipulated and controlled, for example, by variation of the  vehicle composition and manipulation of the ratio of com  ponents used in the Suspension vehicle.   4.O.O DELIVERY OF SUSPENSION  FORMULATIONS  0143.  The suspension formulations described herein may  be used in an implantable drug delivery device to provide  Sustained delivery of a compound over an extended period  of time, such as over weeks, months, or up to about one year,  for example, at least  about  1  month, at  least about  1.5  months, preferably at least about 3 months, preferably at  least  about 6 months, more preferably at  least  about 9  months, more preferably at least about 12 months. Such an  implantable drug delivery device is  typically capable of  delivering the compound at a desired flow rate over a desired  period of time. The suspension formulation may be loaded  into the implantable drug delivery device by conventional  techniques.  0144.  The suspension formulation may be delivered, for  example, using an osmotically,  mechanically, electrome  chanically, or chemically driven drug delivery device. The  highly concentrated drug particle formulation is delivered at  a  flow  rate  that  delivers  a drug that  is  therapeutically  effective to the subject in need of treatment by the drug.  0145  The drug may be delivered over a period ranging  from more than about one week to about one year or more,  preferably for about one month to about a year or more,  more preferably for about three months to about a year or  more. The implantable drug delivery device may include a  reservoir having at least one orifice through which the drug  is  delivered.  The suspension formulation  may be stored  within the reservoir.  In one embodiment, the implantable   drug delivery device is an osmotic delivery device, wherein  delivery of the drug is osmotically driven. Some osmotic  delivery  devices  and  their  component parts  have been  described, for example, the DUROSR) delivery device or  similar devices (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,609,885; 5,728,  396;  5,985,305;  5,997,527;  6,113,938;  6,132,420;  6,156,  331;  6,217,906;  6,261,584;  6,270,787;  6,287,295;  6,375,  978;  6,395,292;  6,508,808:  6,544,252:  6,635,268;  6,682,  522;  6,923,800;  6,939,556;  6,976,981;  6,997,922;  7,014,  636;  7,207,982;  7.112,335,  7,163,688;  U.S.  Patent  Publication Nos. 2005-0175701, 2007-0281024, and 2008  0091176).  0146  The DUROS(R) delivery device typically consists of  a cylindrical reservoir which contains the osmotic engine,  piston, and drug formulation. The reservoir is capped at one  end by a controlled-rate,  semipermeable membrane and  capped at the other end by a diffusion moderator through  which drug formulation is released from the drug reservoir.  The piston separates the drug formulation from the osmotic  engine and utilizes a seal to prevent the water in the osmotic  engine compartment from entering the drug reservoir. The  diffusion  moderator is  designed, in  conjunction with the  drug formulation, to prevent body fluid from entering the  drug reservoir through the orifice.  0147  The DUROS(R) device releases a drug at a prede  termined rate based on the principle of osmosis. Extracel  lular fluid enters the DUROSR) device through a semiper  meable membrane directly into a salt engine that expands to  drive the piston at a slow and even delivery rate. Movement  of the piston forces the drug formulation to be released  through the orifice or exit port at a predetermined sheer rate.  In one embodiment of the present invention, the reservoir of  the DUROSR) device is loaded with a suspension formula  tion of the present invention, comprising a highly concen  trated  drug  particle  formulation,  wherein  the  device  is  capable of delivering the Suspension formulation to a subject  over an extended period of time (e.g., about 1, about 3, about  6, or about 12 months) at a pre-determined, therapeutically  effective delivery rate.  (0.148.  Implantable devices, for example, the DUROS(R)  device, provide the following advantages for administration  of a highly concentrated drug particle formulation:  true  Zero-order release of the beneficial agent pharmacokineti  cally; long-term release period time (e.g., up to about 12  months); patient compliance; and reliable delivery and dos  ing of a drug.  0149  Other implantable drug delivery devices may be  used in the practice of the present invention and may include  regulator-type  implantable  pumps  that  provide  constant  flow, adjustable flow, or programmable flow of the com  pound, such as those available from Codman & Shurtleff,  Inc.  (Raynham,  Mass.),  Medtronic,  Inc.  (Minneapolis,  Minn.), and Tricumed Medinzintechnik GmbH (Germany).  0150.  The amount of highly concentrated drug particle  formulation employed in the delivery device of the invention  is that amount necessary to deliver a therapeutically effec  tive amount of the agent to achieve the desired therapeutic  result.  In  practice,  this  will  vary  depending upon Such  variables, for example, as the particular agent, the site of  delivery,  the severity  of the  condition, and the  desired  therapeutic effect. Examples of approximate release rates of  exemplary highly concentrated drug particle formulations of  the present invention are presented in Example 4, including   \fUS 2017/01 19854 A1   May 4, 2017   release rates for exenatide (FIG. 2, FIG. 3, and FIG. 5) and  release rates for omega interferon (FIG. 1 and FIG. 4).  0151.  The data presented in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 illustrate  another aspect  of the  present  invention  wherein  highly  concentrated drug particles of the present invention can be  used in a method of controlling the release rate of a drug by  varying the weight percent of the particles loaded into a  Suspension formulation, the concentration of the drug in the  particle formulation, or both. Such a method is  useful to  prepare osmotic delivery devices able to deliver customiz  able concentrations of drug over time, wherein a series of  stock particle formulations covering a range of drug con  centrations/particle can be used individually or in combina  tion  over a range  of particle  loading concentrations  to  provide delivery of a selected concentration of drug over  time. This allows for efficiencies in manufacturing to pre  pare different dosing regimens or even provide for custom  ized dosing of individuals, for example by weight. Thus,  different dose levels can be provided as needed.  0152  Typically, for an osmotic delivery device, the vol  ume of a beneficial agent chamber comprising the beneficial  agent formulation is between about 100 ul to about 1000 ul,  more preferably between about 120 ul and about 500 ul,  more preferably between about 150 ul and about 200 ul.  0153.  Typically, the osmotic delivery device is implanted  within the subject, for example, subcutaneously. The device  (s) can be inserted subcutaneously into either or both arms  (e.g., in the inside, outside, or back of the upper arm) or the  abdomen. Preferred locations in the abdomen are under the  abdominal skin in the area extending below the ribs and  above the belt line. To provide a number of locations for  insertion of one or more osmotic delivery device within the  abdomen, the abdominal wall can be divided into 4 quad  rants as follows: the upper right quadrant extending 5-8  centimeters below the right ribs and about 5-8 centimeters to  the right of the midline, the lower right quadrant extending  5-8 centimeters above the belt line and 5-8 centimeters to the  right of the midline, the upper left quadrant extending 5-8  centimeters below the left ribs and about 5-8 centimeters to  the left of the midline, and the lower left quadrant extending  5-8 centimeters above the belt line and 5-8 centimeters to the  left of the midline. This provides multiple available loca  tions for implantation of one or more devices on one or more  occasions.  0154  The suspension formulations of the present inven  tion comprising highly concentrated drug particle formula  tions may also be delivered from a drug delivery device that  is  not implantable or implanted, for example, an external  pump such as a peristaltic pump used for Subcutaneous  delivery in a hospital setting.  0155  The suspension formulations of the present inven  tion may also be used in infusion pumps, for example, the  ALZETR)  (DURECT  Corporation,  Cupertino  Calif.)  osmotic pumps which are miniature, infusion pumps for the  continuous dosing of laboratory animals (e.g.,  mice and  rats).  0156  The suspension formulations of the present inven  tion may also be used in the form of injections to provide  highly concentrated bolus doses of drug.  0157  Some advantages and benefits of the suspension  formulations  of the  present  invention  delivered  via  an  osmotic  delivery  device,  such  as  a  DUROSR  device,  include,  but are not limited  to  the following.  Increased  treatment compliance can result in better efficacy and Such   increased compliance can be achieved using an implanted  osmotic  delivery  device.  Efficacy  of treatment  can  be  improved because an implantable osmotic delivery device,  such as a DUROSR) device, can provide continuous and  consistent delivery of drug 24 hours per day. Also, unlike  other Sustained release formulations and depot injections,  drug dosing when using a DUROSR) device can be imme  diately halted by removal of the device, for example, if a  safety issue arises for a particular Subject.  0158.  The present invention also includes  methods of  manufacturing the formulations of the present invention,  including the particle formulations, Suspension vehicles, and  suspension formulations described herein above. The pres  ent  invention  also  includes  methods  of  manufacturing  osmotic delivery devices comprising, for example, loading a  selected  Suspension  formulation  into  a  reservoir  of an  osmotic delivery device.   5.O.O SUSPENSION FORMULATIONUSES  0159.  The suspension formulations as described herein  provide promising alternatives to many therapies requiring  daily dosing of a selected drug. For example, the Suspension  formulations of the present invention comprising highly  concentrated incretin mimetic particle formulations may be  useful in the treatment of diabetes (e.g., diabetes mellitus,  and gestational  diabetes),  and diabetic  related  disorders  (e.g., diabetic cardiomyopathy, insulin resistance, diabetic  neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, cata  racts, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension,  hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and tis  Sue ischemia, particularly myocardial ischemia), as well as,  hyperglycemia (e.g., related to treatment with medications  that  increase  the  risk  of hyperglycemia,  including  beta  blockers, thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, niacin, pentami  dine, protease inhibitors, L-asparaginase, and some antip  sychotic agents), reducing food intake (e.g., treating obesity,  controlling appetite, or reducing weight), stroke, lowering  plasma lipids, acute coronary syndrome, hibernating myo  cardium, regulating gastrointestinal motility, and increasing  urine flow.  0160.  In addition,  the suspension formulations of the  present invention may be potential regulators of appetite in  subjects treated with the formulations.  0.161  AS another example, highly concentrated drug par  ticle formulations comprising an interferon may be useful  for the treatment of interferon-responsive disorders, such as  viral infection, immune disorders, and cancers. Treatment of  Such interferon-responsive disorders is generally carried out  over an extended period of time.  For example,  omega  interferon can be used for the treatment of viral infections,  for example, Flavivirus infections (e.g., hepatitis C, yellow  fever,  and West Nile;  Buckwold, V. E.,  et al.,  Antiviral  Research 73:118-125 (2007)). Non-compliance with dosing  schedules has historically been a problem for Such long-term  treatments.  The Suspension  formulations  of the  present  invention when provided in, for example, osmotic delivery  devices, provide a desirable alternative to daily injections.  0162.  In one embodiment, suspension formulations are  administered using an osmotic delivery device as described  above. The release rates of the suspension formulations of  the present invention provide osmotic delivery systems that  consistently and uniformly deliver drug at a selected deliv  ery rate over extended periods of time. Examples of achieve  ment of delivery rates using the Suspension formulations of   \fUS 2017/01 19854 A1   May 4, 2017   the present invention are provided in Example 4. The release  rate data indicated that the systems consistently and uni  formly deliver drug at an approximate delivery rate of 50  ug/day for interferon (FIG. 1), an approximate rate of 75  ug/day exenatide (FIG. 2), and an approximate rate of 80  ug/day exenatide (FIG. 3).  0163  An exit sheer rate of the suspension formulation  from the osmotic delivery device is determined such that the  daily target delivery rate of the drug is reasonably achieved  by Substantially continuous, uniform delivery of the Suspen  sion  formulation  from  the  osmotic  delivery  device.  Examples of exit sheer rates include, but are not limited to,  about 1 to about 1x107 reciprocal second, preferably about  4x10\u00b0 to about 6x10\" reciprocal second, more preferably  5x10  to 1x10  reciprocal second.   6.O.O OSMOTIC DELIVERY DEVICES  0164.  The highly concentrated drug particle formulations  of the present invention may be delivered,  for example,  using osmotic delivery systems. In one embodiment, the  present invention relates to use of osmotic delivery devices  having reduced size relative to osmotic delivery devices in  current use. FIG. 6B shows a schematic representation of an  osmotic delivery system having the dimensions of about 45  mm in  length and about 3.8  mm in  diameter.  Osmotic  delivery devices of this size have been used for the delivery  of for example, omega interferon particle Suspension for  mulations and exenatide particle Suspension formulations  (\u201cContinuous Delivery of Stabilized Proteins and Peptides at  Consistent  Rates  for  at  least  Three  Months  from  the  DUROSR Device,  2008 American Association of Pharma  ceutical Sciences, Annual Meeting and Exposition, Poster  No. T3150, Nov. 18, 2008, Yang, B., et al.:  \u201cA Phase 1b  Study of ITCA 650: Continuous Subcutaneous Delivery of  Exenatide via DUROSR Device Lowers Fasting and Post  prandial Plasma Glucose.\u201d American Diabetes Association  69th Scientific Sessions, Jun. 5-9, 2009, Luskey, K., et al.:  and \u201cA Phase 1b Study of ITCA 650: Continuous Subcuta  neous Delivery of Exenatide via DUROSR Device Lowers  Fasting and Postprandial Plasma Glucose.\u201d European Asso  ciation for the Study of Diabetes 45th Annual Meeting, Sep.  29 to Oct. 3, 2009, Luskey, K., et al.). The highly concen  trated drug particle formulations of the present invention  facilitate the use of osmotic delivery devices of even smaller  dimensions while still providing the ability to provide con  tinuous long-term delivery of controlled amounts of drug  over time. For example, FIG. 6C shows a schematic repre  sentation of an osmotic delivery system having the dimen  sions of about 30 mm in  length  and about 3.8  mm in  diameter. By increasing the drug concentration in the drug  particle formulation, the amount of the drug particle Sus  pension formulation to be loaded into the osmotic delivery  device can be reduced, the flow rate of the drug particle  Suspension formulation can be reduced, and the size of the  osmotic delivery device can also be reduced while main  taining the ability to provide continuous long-term delivery  of predetermined amounts of drug over time.  0.165  Embodiments  of implantable  osmotic  delivery  devices typically comprise the following components (see  FIG. 6A): an impermeable reservoir, the interior walls of  which define a lumen, a semipermeable membrane at a first  end of the reservoir, a first chamber capable of containing an  osmotic  agent,  a piston,  a second chamber capable  of  containing a drug Suspension formulation, and a diffusion   moderator and orifice at a second end of the reservoir. The  first chamber is defined by a first surface the semipermeable  membrane and a first  Surface of an adjacent piston. The  second chamber is defined by a second Surface of the piston  and a first surface of the diffusion moderator.  (0166  FIG. 6A depicts an example of a DUROSR) deliv  ery system useful in the practice of the present invention. In  FIG. 6A, the osmotic delivery device 10 is shown compris  ing a reservoir 12. A piston assembly 14 is positioned in the  lumen of the reservoir and divides  the lumen into  two  chambers.  In  this  example, the  chamber 16  contains  a  beneficial agent formulation and the chamber 20 contains an  osmotic agent formulation. A semipermeable membrane 18  is positioned at a distal end of the reservoir, adjacent the  chamber 20 containing the osmotic agent formulation. A  diffusion moderator 22 is positioned in mating relationship  at a distal end of the reservoir 12, adjacent the chamber 16  containing the Suspension formulation, comprising the drug.  The diffusion moderator 22 includes a delivery orifice 24.  The diffusion moderator 22 may be any suitable flow device  having a delivery orifice. In this embodiment, the flow path  26 is formed between a threaded diffusion moderator 22 and  threads 28 formed on the interior surface of the reservoir 12.  In alternative embodiments, the diffusion moderator can, for  example, (i) be press-fit (or friction fit) through an opening  and contacting a Smooth interior Surface of the reservoir, or  (ii) comprise two pieces with an outer shell constructed and  arranged  for  positioning  in  an  opening,  an  inner  core  inserted in the outer shell, and a fluid channel having a spiral  shape defined between the outer shell and the inner core  (e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007-0281024).  (0167  Fluid is imbibed into the chamber 20 through the  semipermeable membrane 18. The beneficial agent formu  lation is dispensed from the chamber 16 through the delivery  orifice 24 in the diffusion moderator 22. The piston assembly  14 engages and seals against the interior wall of the reservoir  12, thereby isolating the osmotic agent formulation in cham  ber 20 and fluid imbibed through the semipermeable mem  brane 18 from the beneficial agent formulation in chamber  16. At steady-state, the Suspension formulation is expelled  through the delivery orifice 24 in the diffusion moderator 22  at a rate corresponding to the rate at which external fluid is  imbibed into the chamber 20 through the semipermeable  membrane  18.  That  is,  the  DUROSR) delivery  device  releases drug at a predetermined rate based on the principle  of osmosis. Extracellular fluid enters the DUROSR) delivery  device through the semipermeable membrane directly into  the osmotic engine that expands to drive the piston at a slow  and consistent rate of travel. Movement of the piston forces  the drug formulation to be released through the orifice of the  diffusion  moderator resulting  in  Substantial  steady-state  delivery of the drug.  0.168.  The semipermeable membrane 18 may be in the  form of a plug that is resiliently engaged in sealing rela  tionship with the interior surface of the reservoir 12. In FIG.  6A, it  is  shown to have ridges that serve to  frictionally  engage the semipermeable membrane 18 with the interior  surface of the reservoir 12.  0169  Embodiments of osmotic delivery devices having  reduced size  typically  comprise similar  components as  described relative to  FIG. 6A. Osmotic delivery devices  currently in use typically have the dimensions shown in FIG.  6B, that is, about 45 mm in length and about 3.8 mm in  diameter. An osmotic delivery device having reduced size   \fUS 2017/01 19854 A1   May 4, 2017   relative to the devices currently in use in shown in FIG. 6C  having the dimensions of about 30 mm in length and about  3.8 mm in diameter. A marker band (e.g., the laser marker  band shown in FIG. 6B and FIG. 6C) is optional and can be  used, for example, to mark devices having different dosages  or different drug suspensions to distinguish between devices  and further may be useful for assisting with determination of  the desired insertion orientation for implantation. An exter  nal groove (e.g., as shown in FIG. 6B and FIG. 6C) is also  optional and is typically used to assist in identification of the  semipermeable membrane end of the device and determi  nation  of the desired orientation  of the device insertion  orientation for implantation.  0170  The reservoirs  of the osmotic delivery  devices,  having reduced size, of the present invention are typically  made of a material impermeable to the environment of use  (e.g., bodily fluids) and impermeable to the osmotic agent as  well as the drug suspension formulation. Preferred materials  for the reservoir include, but are not limited to, titanium and  titanium alloys.  Exemplary sizes of the reservoir for the  devices of the present invention include osmotic delivery  devices having an overall length of between about 35 mm  and about 20 mm in length, preferably between about 30 mm  and about 25 mm in length, more preferably about 28 mm  to 33 mm in length, and a diameter of between about 8 mm  and about 3 mm, preferably a diameter of about 3.8-4 mm.  In one embodiment, the osmotic delivery device has a length  of about 30 mm and a diameter of about 3.8 mm.  (0171  Exemplary embodiments of the components of the  osmotic delivery devices and materials used for their manu  facture can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,728,  396, 6,113,938, 6,132,420, 6,270,787, 6,375,978, 6,544,252,  6,508,808,  5,997,527,  6,524,305,  6,287,295,  7,163,688,  7,074,423,  7,014,636,  6,939,556,  7,207,982,  7,241,457,  7,407,499, and U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2005-0010196,  2005-0101943,  2005-0175701,  2007-0281024,  2008  0091176. Such components can be sized to provide osmotic  delivery devices having reduced size in view of the teach  ings of the present specification.  0172.  In one embodiment, maintaining essentially  the  same reservoir diameter between larger and Smaller osmotic  delivery devices provides the advantage that the components  of the two devices other than the reservoir (e.g., semiper  meable membrane, piston, and diffusion moderator) can be  manufactured in one size and the components used inter  changeable between the two devices. Similarly, a range of  devices having a range of reservoir lengths can be provided  wherein the remaining components can be used interchange  ably for the manufacture of multiple devices having different  reservoirs of different length and thus of different volume  and drug loading capacity.   7.O.O SOME ADVANTAGES OF THE HIGHLY  CONCENTRATED DRUG PARTICLE  FORMULATIONS OF THE PRESENT  INVENTION  0173  Particles  that  are  highly  concentrated with  the  active drug are useful for preparing osmotic delivery devices  that can deliver high doses of the drug while keeping the  overall size of the device small enough to be implanted  easily and remain acceptable to the patient. Highly concen  trated drug particle formulations may be particularly useful  when high doses of a selected drug are required for effica  cious treatment of a disease or condition.  In particular,   highly concentrated drug particle formulations extend the  utility and use of osmotic delivery devices to drugs with  lower potency that require doses typically considered too  high for Such devices; for example, proteins such as GLP-1.  exenatide, PYY. oxyntomodulin, GIP, interferon (e.g., alpha,  beta, gamma, lambda, omega, tau, consensus, and Variant  interferons), antibodies, or Small molecules such as testos  terone or other steroids. Highly concentrated particles also  facilitate preparation of high dose osmotic delivery devices  that are needed for dose ranging studies both for animal  toxicology studies and for initial  dose-finding studies  in  humans.  0.174  Highly concentrated drug particles are also useful  for preparing osmotic delivery  devices that  can deliver  therapeutic doses of a drug for an extended period of time.  These are particularly useful for treating chronic diseases  and conditions such as diabetes and obesity where fewer  device  replacements  per year are  desirable.  Example 5  demonstrates that highly concentrated particles are useful  for preparing implantable osmotic delivery devices that can  deliver doses of a drug for extended periods of time at  desired delivery rates.  0.175.  By contrast, suspension formulations comprising  particle formulations containing relatively low concentra  tions of active drug (less  than about 20%) require high  particle loads in order to achieve high daily drug doses.  Higher daily doses require higher weight percents of par  ticles and may result in formulations that are difficult to  pump reliably through the diffusion moderator of the device.  Such high particle loads may cause, for example, either  physical blockage of the outlet channel or internal devices  pressures sufficient to cause device failure from expulsion of  the semipermeable membrane. While one potential solution  might be to  increase the diameter of the outlet channel  and/or decrease the  length  of the  outlet  channel.  Such  strategies may allow ingress of moisture from body fluids  into the drug formulation chamber via the diffusion mod  erator and result in either instability of the drug or physical  instability of the suspension and possible device failure.  0176  Higher concentration of drug in the particles is  useful to maintain particle loads of approximately 30% or  less, 20% or less, or preferably 10% or less of particles by  weight relative to the weight of the entire suspension for  mulation. Accordingly, advantages of the highly concen  trated drug particle formulations of the present invention  include the ability to provide drug at higher concentration  while maintaining lower particle loads in the Suspension  formulation because of the higher drug concentration.  0177  Highly  concentrated  drug particle  formulations  with higher concentrations of the active drug may also have  advantages for the production process and overall process  yields. The production of particles typically begins with a  Solution of the drug in water, followed by a drying step such  as spray drying or lyophilization. Proteins, in particular, are  not stable in aqueous solutions, therefore it is important to  minimize the amount of time the drug is exposed to water.  Higher concentrations of the drug in solution means rela  tively lower quantity of water that must be removed in the  drying process and thereby a faster drying process. A faster  drying process may be particularly important for preparation  of drug  particles  comprising  drug  molecules  that  are  unstable  to  high  temperatures  and/or when exposed to  moisture.   \fUS 2017/01 19854 A1   May 4, 2017   0.178  An additional benefit may be that the sizes of the  particles formed by the faster drying process are Smaller  than the particles formed using a lower concentration. Pro  viding smaller particles further reduces the potential  for  clogging the outlet channel of the diffusion moderator and  may facilitate  use  of Smaller  channel  diameters  and/or  lengths if required for the reliability and performance of  particular  osmotic  delivery  device/formulation  combina  tions.  0179  Another advantage of the suspension formulations  comprising highly concentrated drug particle formulations  of the present invention is the ability to use osmotic delivery  devices of reduced size  for  delivery  of the  drug while  maintaining the ability to provide long-term, continuous  delivery of a desired drug concentration. In one embodi  ment, the present invention relates to an osmotic delivery  device having an overall length of between about 35 mm and  about 20 mm in length, preferably between about 30 mm and  about 25 mm in length, more preferably about 28 mm to 33  mm in length, and a diameter of between about 8 mm and  about 3 mm, preferably a diameter of about 3.8-4 mm. The  osmotic delivery device can be loaded with the suspension  formulations comprising highly concentrated drug particle  formulations of the present invention. Advantages of using  the osmotic delivery devices, having reduced size, of the  present invention (versus current osmotic delivery devices,  for example, having the dimensions shown in  FIG. 6B)  include, but are not limited to, (i) improved ease of implan  tation and removal, (ii) a larger number of possible implan  tation sites (e.g., in the underside of the arms and throughout  the abdominal area), and (iii) reduced psychological impact  on patients regarding the implantation/removal of a foreign  object.  0180  Further, the ability to use the suspension formula  tions comprising highly concentrated drug particle formu  lations of the present invention in a variety of different sizes  of osmotic delivery devices allows tailoring of device size in  combination with drug concentration in Suspension formu  lation  to  provide a wide array  of dosage  forms,  drug  strengths, and delivery durations. For example, Suspension  formulations having the same drug concentration can be  used for devices delivering the drug for at least about 1  month, at least about 1.5 months, preferably at least about 3  months, preferably at least about 6 months, more preferably  at least about 9 months, and more preferably at least about  12 months by filling reservoirs to different volumes.  0181  Advantages of the highly concentrated drug par  ticle formulations of the present invention include improved  drug stability that allows broad geographical distribution,  for example, without refrigeration, and improved access to  drugs normally having poor stability but that are stabilized  in the highly concentrated drug particle formulations. Addi  tional advantages of the Suspension formulations comprising  highly concentrated drug particle formulations of the present  invention include the ability to deliver more drug in less  Volume, delivering less of the non-drug components of the  Suspension formulation, improved patient compliance with  treatments of prolonged duration, and reduced possible drug  side-effects (e.g., nausea and/or vomiting) because of con  sistent delivery of the drug without peaks or troughs of drug  concentration.  0182.

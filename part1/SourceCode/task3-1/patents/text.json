More particularly the invention relates to a method of \ndelivering at least one therapeutic compound or a formulation \ncomprising the at least one therapeutic compound to a patient; \nto a throwaway or reusable device for delivering at least one \ntherapeutic compound or a formulation comprising the at \nleast one therapeutic compound to a patient in a manner as set \nout by the method; to a pioneer projectile for use in said \nmethod; to formulations for use in said method and to an \ninjectate comprising a pioneer projectile and formulation. It \nalso relates to a disposable component containing either a \npioneer projectile or an injectate. The present invention also \nrelates to a throwaway or reusable device for delivering at \nleast one therapeutic compound, or a formulation comprising \nthe at least one therapeutic compound (hereafter drug) to a \npatient, and a method for administering a drug to a patient \nusing said device. It also relates to a packaged drug for use \nwith said device. \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION \n\n35 \n\nOne route of administration for therapeutic compounds is \nthrough the skin. The skin is also one of the more efficient \nroutes for delivery of a therapeutic compound when com \npared to other standard delivery routes such as oral or pulmo \nnary delivery. \n\nAdministration to the skin is most commonly undertaken \nusing a needle and Syringe as a delivery system with the \ntherapeutic compound in a liquid form. \n\nSucha system has a number of associated problems includ \ning the pain and fear associated with needles, the fact they are \nreally best Suited to injecting liquids which are not necessar \nily the best way of delivering compounds to a patient and the \nfact that sharps are left which create a disposal problem. \n\nDrug delivery systems that do not incorporate needles are \nalso used for injecting liquids through the skin and this is \nachieved by the delivery system creating a very fine, high \nVelocity liquid jet that creates its own hole through the skin. \nThere are however a number of problems with such a method \nincluding splashback. \n\nWith both these forms of liquid delivery relatively large \nVolumes of liquid are injected which, because they are incom \npressible, have to tear the tissue apart in order to be accom \nmodated. \n\nHowever, drug injection through the skin does not have to \nbe achieved with the drug in a standard liquid form. Solid \nform drugs have been successfully administered with the \nPowderJect system, which uses a compressed gas source to \naccelerate powdered drugs to a Velocity at which they can \npenetrate the outer layers of the skin. This system typically \nemploys powdered drug particles of less than 100 microns in \ndiameter, which require a velocity of several hundred meters \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n2 \nper second in order to penetrate human tissue. However the \nsystem has its  own inherent problems such as controlled \ndelivery. \n\nIt has also been shown in the past that solid rods or splinters \nof a therapeutic compound can be pushed, at a relatively low \nvelocity, into the skin without the requirement for a needle \nalthough more traditionally these are delivered as implants. \nThe current transdermal drug delivery techniques can thus \nbe categorised into groups based on the drug form and the \nvelocity of the injection as set out in table 1 below: \n\nTABLE 1 \n\nDrug Form \n\nSolid \n\nDrug Injection Velocity \n\nLiquid \n\nHigh Velocity \n\nLow Velocity \n\nLiquid Jet Injector \n\nPowderJect Systems \nDrug darts \n\nNeedle and Syringe  Drug Splinters' \n\nDrug darts are disclosed in a number of publications. WO \n96/40351 (American Cyanamid) discloses an implant dart \nwith a head of a solid plastics material which takes the form \nof a blade and a tubular body that contains one or more \nSustained release drug delivery implant packages. Flexible \nstabilizing wings are provided on either side of the dart head \nwhich serve as a lock or barb to prevent the dart being pulled \nout after entry. The dart has on outside diameter of about 7 \nmm and a length of about 45 mm and is delivered with an \ninjection gun which fires the dart into an animal, but not a \nhuman, when a trigger is released. The propulsion mecha \nnism delivers a force sufficient to impart a high accelerating \nvelocity of from 40-60 mph on the dart. To inject the dart at \nlow speed it is necessary to make a small incision in the \nanimal and operate the push bar manually. \n\nU.S. Pat. Nos. 3,948,263 and 4,326,524 also disclose bal \nlistic delivery devices. U.S. Pat. No. 3,948.263 discloses a \nballistic implant which is fired from a 0.25 calibre rifle. The \nprojectile exits at about 900 ft/sec and can travel 20-40 ft \nbefore implanting into muscle Some 1-2 inches beneath the \nskin. U.S. Pat. No.4,326,524 discloses a solid dose ballistic \nprojectile formed entirely of a cohesive mixture comprising \nbiologically active material, in the form of grindable solid \nparticles and a binder which is capable of withstanding the \nstresses imparted on impact. The projectile has a body portion \nwith a diameter of from 4.5 to 7.6 mm, with a conical nose \nportion with a base diameter smaller than the diameter of the \nbody such that a slight shoulder region is formed between the \nbody and the nose. The end remote from the nose is preferably \nconcave to aid flight. \n\nGB2365100 is another example of a remote ballistic deliv \nery device which is fired and attains velocities of greater than \n500m/s. In contrast to those described above the device is \nslowed on impact so that it does not enter the body but instead \nthe device's nose is moved back such that a needle enters the \nbody, and a drug is injected. Such a device is not needleless. \nCA1019638 discloses a projectile which is launched by a \nconventional air gun or bow. It comprises a head piece and a \nshaft, the head piece pierces the animals flesh and the shaft \nbreaks away. In one embodiment the head piece is made of a \nporous material which retains a liquid drug through capillary \naction through launch and impact and which releases it by \ndiffusion when it  is  inserted into the animal. In a second \nembodiment the head piece takes the form of a hardened cake. \nTo aid penetration a metal or plastics tip may be provided. The \ndrug delivering element remaining in the skin is about 3 mm \ndiameter by 13 mm in length. \n\n\fUS 8,574,188 B2 \n\n3 \nU.S. Pat. No. 3,901,158 Ferb discloses a hypodermic pro \njectile which is again fired from a rifle or pistol. It comprises \na shatterable front end of plastic or glass which breaks on \nimpact releasing the liquid contents. \n\nNone of the described high velocity  devices bear any \nresemblance to the present invention in which the at least one \ntherapeutic compound or a formulation comprising the at \nleast one therapeutic compound is pushed at low velocity \nfrom a device which contacts the skin and in which the pio \nneer projectile is water soluble, lipid soluble or otherwise \nbiodegradable in the human or animal and is  furthermore \nsignificantly Smaller having a width or diameter of less than 3 \nmm in width, more preferably still less than 2.5 mm through \n2 mm and 1.5 mm to about 1 mm in width; a height of less than \n10 mm in height, more preferably about 1.5 to 2 mm in height \nand an aspect ratio of less than 1:8, preferably less than 1:6, \nmore preferably less than 1:4, more preferably still less than \n1:3, and most preferably about 1:1.5. \nHigh velocity liquid systems are exemplified by U.S. Pat. \nNo. 116,313 McGregor. Liquid is first ejected from a small \norifice in a probe at a very high Velocity and pressure which \nwill penetrate the skin and then the main charge of liquid is \nejected at a lower velocity into the channel formed by the \ninitial penetration. \n\nEP0139286 (Sumitomo Chemical Co Limited) discloses \nSustained-release preparations in the form of needle like or \nbar like shapes, which comprise an active ingredient and a \npharmaceutically acceptable biodegradable carrier. The Sus \ntained-release preparation can be administered to the body by \ninjection by pushing it through a hollow needle or by implan \ntation. \n\nWO 94/22423  (Bukh Meditec AIS) discloses  a  drug \nadministration system. The method of parenteral administra \ntion comprises administering a drug Substance by penetrating \nthe skin or the mucosa of a human oran animal by a body with \nan appropriately formed Solid pharmaceutical composition. \nThe body of the pharmaceutical composition may be needle \nshaped so as to avoid external penetration equipment. The \nSolid pharmaceutical composition comprises at least one drug \nSubstance and has a shape and/or strength to enable penetra \ntion. The composition is made by mixing a material, prefer \nably a polymer and optionally a filler with an active drug \nSubstance; extruding the mixture to form an elongate body; \ndrying it and forming a pointed end. \n\nU.S. Pat. Nos. 5,542,920, 6,117,443 and 6,120,786 (Cherif \nCheikh)  all  disclose  needle-less  parenteral  introduction \ndevices. A medicament is made in the form of a solid needle \nhaving a pointed end that has sufficient structural integrity to \npenetrate the skin. The needles are less than 2 mm, preferably \n0.2 to 0.8 mm, in diameter and 10 to 30 mm in length. \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,102,896 (Roser) is primarily directed to a \ndisposable injector device for injecting controlled release \nwater Soluble glass needles. It however also recognises that \nthese glass needles, which are about 1 mm in diameter by 10 \nmm in length and contain a medicament may also be used as \npioneer projectiles to  produce a low resistance pathway \nthrough the tissue along which a liquid Suspension (exempli \nfied as a drug in a suspension of PFC fluid) can flow. This \ndocument appears the first and only document to recognise \nthat a dissolvable pioneer projectile may be used to enable the \nintroduction of a medicament. It however fails to recognise \nthat it may be used as a general technique for introducing \nmedicaments in other forms. Indeed this is readily apparent \nfrom the document in which a dry powdered formulation is \nmade into a non viscous liquid by Suspending it in PFC. \n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\nThe present invention takes the concept of using a pioneer \nprojection (as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,102.896) further \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n4 \nand follows from the applicants recognition that a pioneer \nprojectile can be used as a means for introducing medica \nments in forms other than a free flowing, non viscous liquid. \nAccording to a first aspect of the present invention there is \nprovided a method of delivering at least one therapeutic com \npound or a formulation containing the at least one therapeutic \ncompound to a human or animal in the form of a needleless \ninjection comprising: \n\ni) Penetrating the skin with a water soluble, lipid soluble or \notherwise biodegradable pioneer projectile having a \ndiameter of less than 3 mm which is left in the human or \nanimal; and \n\nii) Introducing directly, or substantially directly, behind the \npioneer projectile, the at least one therapeutic compound \nor the formulation containing the at least one therapeutic \ncompound, which at least one therapeutic compound or \nthe formulation containing the at least one therapeutic \ncompound is provided and delivered in a contained State. \n\nBy contained State is meant either: \ni) As a liquid contained by a membrane; \nii) As a liquid with a viscosity of at least 5000 centipoises \n(the  Viscosity  of honey),  more particularly  at  least \n50,000 (the consistency of mayonnaise) and most pref \nerably still at least 100,000 (the consistency of peanut \nbutter), Such that the liquid has characteristics more akin \nto a solid than a liquid i.e. they have a definite shape as \nwell as volume (and are not readily free flowing); \niii) As a semi-solid (having a viscosity and rigidity inter \n\nmediate that of a Solid or a liquid); \n\niv) As a paste (having a soft malleable consistency); \nV) As a gel (a liquid dispersed in a solid) which materials \ncan all be considered to have a degree of stiffness; or \nvi) As a solid (a state in which the matter retains its own \nshape). \n\nIntroducing a medicament in Such a contained State has \nadvantages in that splash back and seepage can be avoided \nand more controlled dosages delivered when compared to a \nfollowing non Viscous liquid formulation. The viscous, semi \nSolid or Solid nature of the medicament ensures that the pio \nneer projectile is pushed to the requisite depth and is followed \nby the medicament rather than seeping around the sides of the \nprojectile. The semi Solid formulations, gels, pastes and sol \nids are also generally more stable than liquid formulations \nand are more patient compliable. \n\nFurthermore it will be appreciated that by introducing the \nmedicament in a form other than as a non viscous liquid \nbehind a pioneer projectile it is possible to tailor the charac \nteristics of the medicament for optimum pharmacokinetic \ndelivery rather than for penetration. \n\nSimilarly the pioneer projectile can be developed to have \noptimised penetrating capabilities independent of the medi \nCament. \n\nPreferably the pioneer projectile is independent of the at \nleast one therapeutic compound or the formulation containing \nthe at least one therapeutic compound. \n\nAlternatively the pioneer projectile is independent of yet \nforms an integral part of the at least one therapeutic com \npound or the formulation containing the at least one thera \npeutic compound. \n\nMost preferably the pioneer projectile forms a head to the \nat least one therapeutic compound or the formulation contain \ning the at least one therapeutic compound. \n\nThe at least one therapeutic compound or the formulation \ncontaining the at least one therapeutic compound can take a \nnumber of forms. \n\nIn one embodiment the at least one therapeutic compound \nor the formulation containing the at least one therapeutic \n\n\fUS 8,574,188 B2 \n\n5 \ncompound is  a liquid contained in a water soluble, lipid \nsoluble or otherwise biodegradable membrane. \n\nIn another embodiment the at least one therapeutic com \npound or the formulation containing the at least one thera \npeutic compound is provided in a solid form Such as, for \nexample, crystals, particles, granules, beads, rods, discs or a \ncombination thereof. \n\nIn yet another embodiment the at least one therapeutic \ncompound or the formulation containing the at least one \ntherapeutic compound is provided as a viscous liquid, semi \nSolid, gel or paste which may be further Supported, if desir \nable, by a water soluble lipid soluble or otherwise biodegrad \nable membrane. \n\nIn the method of the invention the skin is penetrated and the \ntherapeutic compound administered at a low velocity. By low \nvelocity is meant less than 100 m/s. Preferably the velocity is \nless than 10 m/s, more preferably still less than 5 m/s and most \npreferably in the order of a few m/s. \n\nSince the injectate is pushed at a low velocity rather than \nfired at a high Velocity it is possible to ensure that the dosage \nis always delivered to the correct (and same) depth under the \nskin. This means that the system can be used on different skin \ntypes and skin locations and the dosage will still be delivered \nto the same depth. \n\nAccording to a second aspect of the invention there is \nprovided a method of facilitating the delivery of at least one \ntherapeutic compound or a formulation containing the at least \none therapeutic compound to a human or animal as a needle \nless injection comprising: \n\ni) Providing a water soluble, lipid soluble or otherwise \nbiodegradable pioneer projectile having a diameter of \nless than 3 mm capable of penetrating the human or \nanimals skin; and \n\nii) Providing directly, or substantially directly, behind the \npioneer projectile, the at least one therapeutic compound \nor the formulation containing the at least one therapeutic \ncompound in a contained State. \n\nThe act of pushing the at least one therapeutic compound in \nthe contained State causes the pioneer projectile to penetrate \nthe human or animals skin and the therapeutic compound or \nthe formulation containing the at least one therapeutic com \npound follows the pioneer projectile and is introduced into the \nhuman or animal in the contained state. \n\nThe invention also extends to novel pioneer projectiles. \nAccording to a third aspect of the present invention there is \nprovided a water soluble, lipid soluble or otherwise biode \ngradable pioneer projectile having a diameter of less than 3 \nmm, and which is capable of penetrating the skin of a human \nor animal to thereby facilitate the injection of at least one \nfollowing therapeutic compound or therapeutic compound \ncontaining formulation in a contained State, comprising: \n\ni) A first \u201cpenetrating  face which in use penetrates the \n\nhuman or animals skin; and \n\nii) Remote from the first face a second \u201cdriven  face which \nin the course of injection is the face upon which a driving \nforce is exerted through the contained therapeutic com \npound ortherapeutic compound containing formulation; \ncharacterised in that said pioneer projectile has an aspect \nratio (width to height) of less than 1:10. \n\nBecause the pioneer projectile has been developed sepa \nrately of the medication it has been possible to reduce its size \nfrom one of at least 10 mm in length to about a few millime \nters. It has also been possible to optimise its shape Such that it \nfunctions as a leading head or tip for a following contained \nformulation, the two components forming an injectate. \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n6 \nPreferably the pioneer projectile has an aspect ratio of less \nthan 1:8, preferably less than 1:6, more preferably less than \n1:4, more preferably still less than 1:3, and most preferably \nabout 1:1.5. \n\nPreferably the pioneer projectile is less than 3 mm in width, \nmore preferably still less than 2.5 mm, through 2 mm and 1.5 \nmm, to about 1 mm in width. \n\nPreferably the pioneer is less than 10 mm in height, more \npreferably about 1.5 to 2 mm in height. By reducing the height \nto a minimum it is possible to maximise the amount of thera \npeutic compound being injected. In this regard it should be \nnoted that if the combined pioneer projectile and following \ndrug formulation is too longit might not be possible to deliver \nthe drug to the optimum depth. \n\nIn one embodiment the pioneer projectile is free of any \ntherapeutic compound. In another embodiment it comprises \nat least one therapeutic compound. Thus, for example it might \nbe beneficial to include, for example, an antibiotic in the \npioneer projectile or have it release atherapeutic compoundat \na different rate to the formulation in, for example, the case of \ninsulin injections. \n\nThe skin penetrating face of the pioneer projectile prefer \nably comprises a cutting element to facilitate entry. This may \ntake the form of a sharp point or an oblique edge. Alterna \ntively the skin penetrating face may be blunt or gently curved. \nIn one embodiment the face for contacting the therapeutic \ncompound or therapeutic compound containing formulation \nin a contained state is flat. Alternatively it may be concave or \notherwise hollowed to  facilitate pushing and formulation \ncontainment. \n\nThe pioneer projectile may be made of any suitable mate \nrial. Suitable materials are those hard and rigid enough to \nfacilitate penetration at low velocities. Preferred materials \ninclude glassy materials e.g. the Sugarglasses as noted in WO \n98/41188 which materials are included herein by reference. \nThe term \"sugar  thus covers not only disaccharide Sugars, \nSuch as, trehalose, but also monosaccharide Sugars and their \nnon reducing derivatives, such as, Sugar alcohols including: \nmannitol, inositol, xylitol, ribitol and the like, which form a \ngeneral class of stabilising glass-forming Sugars and Sugar \nderivatives. The term \"sugar glass\u201d is to be understood as \ncovering not only glasses which are readily and rapidly dis \nSolved in an aqueous environment. Such as, trehalose but also \nSugar glasses in which the Sugar molecule has been modified \nby the attachment of one or more hydrophobic side chains to \nmake the glass more slowly soluble in bodily fluids than the \nnative Sugar in order to give controlled release characteristics. \nIn some circumstances the pioneer projectile may com \nprise a barrier material over at least the face that contacts the \ntherapeutic compound in a contained State or vice versa Such \nthat  the  respective components will  not  react  with one \nanother. \n\nThe invention also extends to novel formulations. \nAccording to a fourth aspect of the present invention there \nis provided atherapeutic compound ortherapeutic compound \ncontaining formulation which is held in a contained state and \nadapted for introduction into a human oranimal in the form of \na needleless injection behind a water soluble, lipid soluble or \notherwise biodegradable pioneer projectile having a diameter \nof less than 3 mm. \n\nPreferably the formulation comprises less than 50 mg of \ntherapeutic compound in a volume of less than 50mm, more \npreferably less than 10 mg of therapeutic compound in a \nvolume of less than 10 mm. \n\n\fUS 8,574,188 B2 \n\n7 \nThe therapeutic compound or therapeutic compound con \ntaining formulation may be provided as a liquid contained in \nwater soluble, lipid soluble or otherwise biodegradable mem \nbrane. \n\nIn an alternative embodiment the therapeutic compound or \ntherapeutic compound containing formulation is provided in \na solid form comprising for example crystals, particles, gran \nules, beads, rods, discs or a combination thereof which are \ngenerally likely to be more stable than traditional non-viscous \nliquid formulations with a viscosity similar to that of water \ne.g. 1 Centipoise or glucose e.g. 500 Centipoises. \n\nIn a preferred embodiment the therapeutic compound or \ntherapeutic compound containing formulation is provided as \na semi Solid, gel or paste. In this form it is particularly patient \ncompliant and the therapeutic compound is generally likely to \nbe more stable than if it were in a traditional non-viscous \nliquid formulation. \n\nWhere the therapeutic compound ortherapeutic compound \ncontaining formulation is a viscous liquid, it preferably has a \nviscosity of at least 10,000 Centipoises more preferably at \nleast 50,000 Centipoises and more preferably still at least \n100,000 Centipoises. \n\nThe formulation may comprise an end piece beyond the \ntherapeutic compound ortherapeutic compound which is free \nof the \u201cactive' being injected thus ensuring that the entire \ntherapeutic compound enters the patient in a unit dose rather \nthan risk under or over dosing. \n\nThe therapeutic compound or therapeutic compound con \ntaining formulation may comprise a plurality of differently \nformulated elements. \n\nThe therapeutic compound or therapeutic compound con \ntaining formulation may be packaged in a cap, cartridge, \ncarousel or cassette. \n\nThe invention also extends to an injectate comprising a \npioneer projectile and a therapeutic compound or therapeutic \ncompound containing formulation. \n\nAccording to a fifth aspect of the present invention there is \n\nprovided a needleless injectate for injection comprising: \n\na) A water soluble, lipid soluble or otherwise biodegrad \nable pioneer projectile having a diameter of less than 3 \nmm, and \n\nb) A therapeutic compound or therapeutic compound con \ntaining formulation which is held in a contained state \nbehind the pioneer projectile. \n\nThese components are as previously described. \nThe pioneer projectile and therapeutic compound or thera \npeutic compound containing formulation may both be water \nsoluble, lipid soluble or otherwise biodegradable to differing \ndegrees. \n\nA barrier may be provided between the pioneer projectile \nand the therapeutic compound or therapeutic compound con \ntaining formulation. \n\nThe injectate may be contained/packaged in a cap, car \ntridge, carousel or cassette optionally together with a means, \ne.g. an ejector pin, for pushing the injectate out of its con \ntainer. \n\nAlternatively the pioneer projectile and the therapeutic \ncompound or therapeutic compound containing formulation \nare contained/packaged in separate caps, cartridges, carou \nsels or cassettes. \n\nThe invention also extends to a device for injecting a pio \nneer projectile and a therapeutic compound or therapeutic \ncompound containing formulation. \n\nAccording to a sixth aspect of the present invention there is \nprovided a needleless  device (60) for injecting a water \nsoluble, lipid soluble or otherwise biodegradable pioneer pro \njectile (10) having a diameter of less than 3 mm and at least \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n8 \none contained therapeutic compound or therapeutic com \npound containing formulation (42) into a human or animal \nbody, said device comprises a housing (62) containing a \nmechanism (92) capable of generating a force which will \ncause a striker (84) to travel along a striker guide (86), said \nhousing having an end face (100) which is in operative com \nmunication with a component (72) comprising a casing (74) \nhaving an aperture (76) in which is mounted an ejector pin \n(78) and, therebelow, an injectate (40) comprising a pioneer \nprojectile (10) and a formulation (42) such that in use the \nstriker will contact the ejector pin and the injectate will be \npushed out of the casing as a single unit into the human or \nanimal body. \n\nThe reference numerals given above are non-limiting but \nhave been included solely for the purpose of assisting the \nreader. \n\nThe term ejector pin is intented to covera pin, piston, rod or \nlike member which functions to push the injectate from the \naperture. \n\nThe power source for initiating or assisting the pushing \nmay be a mechanical spring in the form of for example, a \ncoiled spring or a lever spring. Alternatively, a gas spring \nmight be used or even an electrically powered system. A \nmechanical spring would allow reuse of the delivery system \nalthough this would mean the user has to recharge the spring \nbetween administrations. Alternatively, the spring (mechani \ncal orgas) could be pre-charged during manufacture so that it \ncan only be used once and then the whole system would be \nthrown away. In a reusable device there will be a throw away \ncomponent containing the pioneer projectile or the pioneer \nprojectile and the therapeutic compound or therapeutic com \npound containing formulation. \n\nThe device preferably incorporates a safety mechanism to \navoid accidental actuation. Actuation might be triggered with \na push button on the device but preferably would be under \ntaken by pushing the device against the skin thus ensuring \ngood contact with the skin on actuation. \n\nIn a reusable device the reusable component and the throw \naway component comprise means by which they are con \nnected to one another. \n\nThe device may be adapted to inject multiple doses either \nsequentially  or simultaneously.  In  one embodiment the \ndevice comprises a cartridge, carousel or cassette containing \na plurality of pioneer projectiles or a plurality of injectates \ncomprising a pioneer projectile and a therapeutic compound \nor therapeutic compound containing formulation. \n\nIn another embodiment the device comprises a cap con \ntaining a single pioneer projectile and a single unit dose of the \ntherapeutic compound or therapeutic compound containing \nformulation. \n\nThe various aspects described above give rise to a system \nhaving a number of advantages over the prior art delivery \nmethods and some of these are noted in table 2 below: \n\nTABLE 2 \n\nBenefit \n\nJustification \n\n1  Can use \n\n60 \n\nformulations with \nIncreased Product \nStability. \n\n2  Improved Product \n\nStorage \n\n65 \n\nMany drugs are more stable in Solid form \nthan in a liquid state. A viscous liquid \nformulation would be more akin to a solid \ndrug in terms of its stability characteristics \nbecause of the excipients that can be used \nThe increased stability with some \ncompounds may allow storage of the final \ndelivery system at room temperature rather \nthan requiring refrigeration \n\n\fUS 8,574,188 B2 \n\n9 \nTABLE 2-continued \n\nBenefit \n\nJustification \n\nReduced Risk Of \nCross Infection \nSmall Device Size \n\nCheap Device \n\n6  Reusable Device \n\n7  Variable Power \n\nSystem \n\n8  Small Skin \nResponse \n9  Quiet Device \n\n10  Easy to Understand \nDelivery System \n\n11  Variable Dose \n\n12  Self Injection \n\n13  Controlled Depth \nOf Penetration \nOf The Delivered \nDose \n14  Large Doses \nAchievable \n\nWithout the need for needles there is a \nreduced risk of blood borne diseases \nSpring, trigger, injectate and piston are the \nmain components required \nA spring is a cheap power source. Small \noverall number of device components \nThe design can allow for the spring to \nbe primed for reuse. Disposable components \nwould be small in terms of size and cost \nbut would include the component holding \nthe injectate or pioneer projectile \nA spring-powered device could allow the \ntension on the spring to be altered for \ndifferent skin types and skin positions \non the body, if necessary. \nAs experienced with splinters \n\nActuation of a spring powered delivery \nsystem will be quiet \nEasy to comprehend the forces involved \nin pushing a foreign body into the skin to \na known depth. Easy to measure the \nphysical characteristics required for a \ndose of injectate of this size \nWith a viscous injectate it will be possible \nto alter the dose injected \nWith a simple system patients can inject \nthemselves, thus reducing healthcare costs \nPushing the injectate into the skin rather \nthan firing it enables a consistent and \ncontrolled depth of penetration in the skin \n\nLarge doses of one or more drugs are \nachievable by having one or more doses \nof injectate administered in the same \ninjection \n\nThe concept behind the invention allows for a simple \nneedleless drug delivery device that pushes a drug in a \"con \ntained' state. \n\nA semi solid, paste or gel is the preferred form since unlike \na non-viscous liquid it would follow the pioneer projectile. (A \nnon-viscous liquid can \u201csplash back  and more easily seep \naround the track formed by the pioneer projectile.) Its stiff \nness relative to a non-viscous liquid also means it is easier to \npush than a non-viscous liquid material. The more solid in \nnature the better this is. However from a comfort perspective \na semi Solid or paste or gel is  more likely to be patient \ncompliant and dissolve more readily in the body. \n\nThe delivery device for delivering such an injectate (pio \nneer projectile and formulation) could take a number of forms \nand several such devices are described by way of example. \nA first device described is a spring-powered device with the \nSpring, triggering the pushing of a pin. The pin then engages \nthe injectate to push it into the skin with the pin being stopped \nby either an end stop within the device or by coming into \ncontact with the skin, preferably over a relatively wide area \n(compared to the injectate) to reduce the force felt on the skin. \nIf the device is to be reusable then the component holding \nthe injectate might be detached from the rest of the device and \nthrown away and a new disposable component attached \nbefore the next injection. The injection itself would occur in \na matter of milliseconds after actuation and would seem \ninstantaneous as far as the user is concerned. Alternatively the \nformulation might be injected from, for example, a tube and \na new pioneer projectile would be required for a further injec \ntion. \n\nBy way of a further development the needleless device \ndescribed with reference to the sixth aspect of the invention \nwas further developed with the aim of producing a simple, \n\n10 \ncheap drug delivery device which is adaptable and able to \ndeliver a drug in the form of not only a needleless injectate but \nalso other forms, such as, for example liquid formulations, \nand solid drug needles. \n\nThis aim is achieved by the provision of a device which is \nadapted to receive a packaged drug which is slidably mounted \nin the device such that in use the device is able to push the drug \nfrom its packaging, the packaged drug being packaged Such \nthat the drug, whatever its form, can be pushed from its \npackaging by the device. \n\nIt is another and independent aim to package different drug \n\nforms for use with such a device. \n\nThis aim is achieved by the provision of a packaging \nadapted to be attached to the device and which comprises a \nchannel housing the drug, and a drive pin or like element for \npushing it out when actuated by the device. \n\nThere are many possible product applications for Such a \ndelivery device and they include therapeutic, prophylactic \nand diagnostic applications. Applications may be limited to \nthose drugs that are administered in relatively low doses \nbecause of the dose limitations for each injection imposed by \npushing. However, although each dose may be limited to less \nthan 10 mg or a volume of less than 10 mm it would be \npossible to administer more than one dose either concurrently \nor sequentially, if larger doses are required. \n\nNew laws in many states in the USA are declaring that \nsafety needles must be used for injections whenever possible. \nThese are needles that withdraw into a sheath as the needle is \nwithdrawn from the patient so that the needle tip is not left \nexposed. This is to avoid the use of a conventional needle \nwhich can result in accidental needle Stick injuries. A delivery \nsystem that either does not require a needle (or that incorpo \nrates a needle that retracts) would be beneficial for the US \nmarket as well as other parts of the world that will, no doubt, \nfollow the lead of the Americans. \n\nParticular applications where the technology might be very \n\nwell suited include: \n\nVaccines:-  Vaccinations are one of the common reasons \nfor people to need an injection and many people would rather \nrisk catching a disease than have to be injected with a standard \nneedle and Syringe. Children in particular can often have a \nneedle phobia. Therefore a system that either does not incor \nporate a needle (or the needle is never seen by the patient) \nmight help compliance with vaccines. In third world coun \ntries there is a great need for delivery systems for vaccines \nthat do not involve needles. An added advantage of the new \ndelivery system is that using a non liquid dose therapeutic \ncompound should assist stability of the active compounds and \ntherefore the cold chain storage requirements for the vaccine \nmay be avoided. \n\nAcute Emergencies:  The device is very quick and easy to \nuse and therefore well suited for self administration as well as \nadministration by an untrained assistant. There are a number \nof drugs. Such as glucagon (hypoglycaemia), migraine treat \nments or adrenalin (anaphylactic shock) that are required \nwhen the patient may not be in a suitable condition to under \ntake the injection themselves. Glucagon and some of the \nmigraine treatments are normally Supplied as a powder that \nhave to be made up with the diluent before the injection which \nmeans that they are not suitable for administration by an \nuntrained assistant. In addition, the patient may, or may not be \nin a fit state to make up the drug let alone administer it. The \npresent device would enable these and similar drugs to be \nadministered in Solid dosage form. \n\nDiabetes:\u2014Millions of people worldwide have to inject \ninsulin either daily or several times a day. Most have to use a \nneedle and Syringe although new delivery systems such as \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n\fUS 8,574,188 B2 \n\n11 \ninhalers and insulin pumps are becoming more popular. The \nadvantage of the new delivery system is that several different \ntypes of insulin can be administered in a Solid dose form at \none time. This can be done by having two or more short pieces \nof different insulin formulations in e.g. a drug cassette. This  5 \ncould allow a short as well as a long acting insulin to be \ninjected at the same time and thus reduce the requirement for \nmultiple injections throughout the day. \n\nAlthough the applications above have been highlighted, \nthe technology is Suitable for administering many drugs that  10 \nare required at the dosage levels capable of being delivered by \nthe system. \n\nAccording to a seventh aspect of the present invention there \n\nis provided a drug delivery device (210) comprising: \ni) a housing (212); \nii) a means (214) for generating a force capable of pushing a \ndrug (216) from a packaging (218) into a human or animal \nbody; \n\niii) a means (220) for transmitting said force to push the drug \n\n(216) from the packaging (218) into the human or animal  20 \nbody; and \n\niv) a means (238,242b) for triggering the device. \n\nThe numbers are again included for illustrative purposes \n\n15 \n\nand are not to be construed as limiting. \n\nSuch a device can be a reusable device which further com- 25 \n\nprises a means (222) for receiving a packaged drug (2100); \nand a means (224) for priming the device. \n\nAlternatively the device can be a single use device in which \ncase the packaged drug (2100) will be an integral part of the \ndevice. Such a device can be provided in a pre primed form  30 \nwhich just needs triggering or in a form requiring it to be \nprimed. \n\nA device according to the invention has a number of advan \n\ntages compared to current needle free devices. \n\nIt comprises a small number of components and is there-  35 \n\nfore cheap to manufacture and assemble. It is also relatively \nSmall (currently the same size as a dry marker pen). \n\nIn a preferred embodiment of the device, it can only be \nactuated by inserting a packaged drug and pushing the skin \ntensioning end of the packaged drug against a solid object.  40 \nThe priming and actuation of the device by pushing the end of \nthe device against the skin ensures that there is a reliable and \nconsistent contact and tensioning of the skin on delivery of \nthe drug. Additionally, by setting the device such that the \nforce required to actuate it is from, for example, 20-30 New- 45 \nton the force will be too high for a patient to accidentally \nactuate the device withoutpushing it firmly against the body\u2019s \ntensioned skin, thereby providing a significant safety feature. \nA spring and cap arrangement makes it is possible to adjust \nthe actuation force by altering the tension on the spring. By 50 \nscrewing the cap further onto the upper barrel the spring is \ntensioned and by unscrewing it the force can be reduced. \nAlternatively, instead of a coil spring as the main power \nSource,  the  device  could incorporate any other type  of \nmechanical spring or a gas spring. In an alternative embodi-  55 \nment the spring could be pre-tensioned during manufacture to \navoid having to tension the spring during the drug adminis \ntration. This would result in a single use device in which case \nthe packaged drug would most likely be an integral part of the \ndevice. \n\n60 \n\nThe Velocity of the impact hammer during administration \nof the therapeutic agent is less than 20 m/s, more preferably \nless than 10 m/s, more preferably still less than 5 m/s and most \npreferably in the order of 0.1-2 m/s. The skilled man will \nappreciate that the actual speed may vary with the mass of the  65 \nimpact hammer and thus the impact imparted on the delivery \ndose. As a consequence the therapeutic agent is delivered by \n\n12 \na pushing action from the end of the packaged drug rather \nthan by a firing action (as would be the case with a bullet \nleaving the barrel of a gun). \n\nTo ensure that the device actuates automatically when the \ncorrect force is applied the hammer has a shaped shoulder \nregion which engages a correspondingly shaped surface in a \nwall separating the upper and lower barrels. The device will \nactuate only when the Substantially frustoconical sections \nfully engage. This will be at the same main spring tension \nevery administration and if the administration is  aborted \nbefore the frustoconical sections engage then the packaged \ndrug can be removed safely  without leaving the device \nprimed. \n\nIn a preferred embodiment the device can\u2019t be primed until \nthe packaged drug is attached thereto since it is the packaged \ndrug that acts against the piston in the device to cause the \nspring to be tensioned. This makes the device particularly \nsafe. It also means it can\u2019t be actuated when not loaded Such \nthat an operator can't use the device in a belief they are \nproviding an injection. \n\nIn the case of a reusable device a stewing spring returns the \nimpact hammer into it\u2019s non axially aligned position at the \nend of each administration. \n\nFurthermore, because the reusable components of the sys \ntem (all components except those of the packaged drug) do \nnot come into contact with the target tissue for the drug \nadministration they do need to be sterile. \n\nAll components apart from the springs can be moulded \nmaking the device cheap to manufacture and the limited num \nber of parts and their ease of assembly keeps assembling costs \nto a minimum. \n\nA range of custom packaged drugs will fit the delivery \ndevice but patients will not be able to easily introduce their \nown therapeutic compounds into the drug cassettes (as can be \ndone with a needle and Syringe). \n\nThe device is suitable for both human and veterinary appli \n\ncations. \n\nThe device is particularly suitable for self administration of \n\ndrugs and requires minimal training. \n\nAccording to an eighth and related aspect of the invention \nthere is provided a packaged drug (2100), for use with a drug \ndelivery device, comprising a packaging (218) containing a \ndrug (216), said packaging (218)  comprising a housing \n(218a, 218b) having a channel (2106) running there through \nand in which is disposed a drive pin or other element (2108), \na skin piercing means (2110: 2112), and the drug (216), said \nhousing (218a, 218b) comprising \n\ni) a region (2102) allowing the packaged drug (2100) to be \nslidably mounted to the drug delivery device (210); and \nii) an end (2104) adapted to engage and tension the skin. \nIn the case of a drug splinter the skin piercing means and \n\nthe drug may be one of the same. \n\nPreferably the drug is disposed between the drive pin and \n\nthe skin piercing means. \n\nPreferably the packaged drug takes the form of a dispos \nable end cap, cartridge, cassette or carousel, containing a \nsingle or multiple doses of the drug. \n\nPreferably the region for engaging the packaged drug to the \ndrug delivery device in a slidable manner additionally com \nprises a means for positively locking it to the device Such that \nit can still slide within the device but will not fall out under \ngravity. Such a means might be a sprung pin or spigot which \nexerts a frictional force against the device or a mechanism \nwhereby the packaged drug is inserted in a particular orien \ntation and turned so that it is precluded from being removed \nunless it is turned back into the position in which it  was \nallowed to enter. \n\n\fUS 8,574,188 B2 \n\n13 \nIn a first embodiment the packaged drug houses either a \npioneer projectile in combination with a drug in a contained \nstate, more preferably a solid, or a drug splinter (a single Solid \nentity). \n\nIn a second embodiment the piercing means comprises a \nneedle with two sharp ends, one for puncturing the skin and \nthe other for puncturing a membrane of a receptacle contain \ning the drug, the drug being released into the needle from \nwhere it drains out into the body through the needle. The drug \nis preferably a liquid and is contained in the receptacle which \nis  disposed in the channel. Advantageous features of the \ndevice include a spacer between the membrane piercing end \nof the needle and the membrane of the drug containing recep \ntacle to prevent the needle coming into contact with the mem \nbrane prior to actuation. The spacer is either resilient or com \npressible and may be Supported by a plate attached to the \nneedle. The receptacle is preferably sealed by the drive pin or \nother like element. \n\nIn a third embodiment the packaged drug may contain a \ndrug in any state (e.g. solid, semi solid or liquid), the actuation \nof the device causing, in a two step operation, first the entry of \na pioneer projectile and only then the release of the drug from \na thin walled tube. Release of the drug may optionally require \nthe breaking of a membrane Supporting the drug in the tube. \nIn a variation of this embodiment the pioneer projectile, \nwhich is located immediately in front of the thin tube, could \nbe replaced by a retractable needle tip which is, or is integral \nwith, the thin walled tube. As per embodiment 1  and 2 \ndescribed above, the thin walled tube could have a compres \nsion spring or other resilient member associated therewith to \nwithdraw the thin walled tube following the injection. \n\nAparticularly clever feature of this embodiment is the form \nof the drive pin or element which has a plurality of flexible or \nfrangible arms, in the embodiment illustrated two, extending \nfrom its main body. These arms extendoutwards (splay) when \nthey ride over a ramped Surface provided on the housing, are \nforced away from the body, and ride over a lip on the tube as \na consequence of the flex or frangibility. In consequence the \nbody of the drive pin or element can move down the tube. This \narrangement facilitates a two step operation whereby in a first \nstep the drive pin or element acts on the tube causing it to \nmove and push the pioneer projectile into the skin, and then, \nand only when the first step is complete, the arms are caused \nto splay and/or Snap thereby allowing the drive pin body to \npush the drug contents from the tube. In the case where the \narms are frangible the arms will Snap off as a result of an area \nof weakness formed about the shoulder region and fall into a \ncavity about the ramped region. A frangible system has two \nadvantages: firstly it should ensure full injection occurs, and \nsecondly it will mean the packaged drug can\u2019t be re-used. The \nramp is preferably \"circular  in design, taking the form of a \nfrustoconical Surface. This has the advantage that it can be \neasily moulded and does not require the arms to be orientated \nfor contact. \n\nDepending on the diameter of the thin walled tube and the \nviscosity of the therapeutic compound, the thin walled tube \nmay need to be sealed, or partially sealed to avoid premature \nloss of the drug. However the action of the drive pin body will \nbe sufficient to break any seal allowing the drug to be released \nand pushed into the patient. \n\nAn advantage of the packaged drugs exemplified is their \nSmall cheap Sub-assembly. They are also easy to handle and \nplace into the device prior to administration. Their size also \nfacilitates easy storage in, for example, refrigerators. \n\nThe packaged drug may be sealed in a foil pouch or the like \nto prevent ingress of for example, moisture, oxygen, light, \nbacteria or other drug degrading or contaminating agents. \n\n14 \nIn those embodiments having a pioneer projectile the tip \nwill, in most instances, be positioned a few millimeters from \nthe end of the drug cassette so that it is moving when it strikes \nthe target tissue. \n\nPreferably the end adapted to engage and tension the skin \ncomprises one or more projections about the channel exit, \nmost preferably in the form of an annular ring, as such an \narrangement most effectively tensions the skin. \n\nA retention system may advantageously be employed to \nhold the drug and pioneer projectile in place in the channel. \nThis might be achieved by, for example, extruding or moul \nding the drug and/orpioneer projectile with a number of small \nsplines or other features along their outer Surface. These \nsplines or other features would provide a frictional fit but \nwould not prohibit the drug from being administered. Alter \nnatively, the channel of the packaging might have a small \nfeature, such as, for example, a retaining bump or other pro \njection over which the pioneer projectile and drug have to be \npushed. \n\nA tamperor use evident seal or other indicator means may \nadditionally be placed over the top end of the packaged drug \nso that when e.g. the seal is broken it is obvious that the \npackaged drug has not been interfered with and/or is spent. \nAdditionally or alternatively a seal may be place over the \nexit of the channel of the packaged drug. It would be prefer \nable to remove this seal prior to administration of the drug but \nit would best be designed such that the administration could \nbe carried out through the seal just in case it wasn\u2019t removed \nby the user. \n\nAccording to yet a further aspect of the invention there is \nprovided a method of delivering a drug to a human or animal \nusing a device and/or packaged drug according to the inven \ntion. \n\nThe various aspects of the invention will now be described, \nby way of example only, with reference to the following \nFigures and Examples. \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n\n40 \n\nFIG. 1a-e are embodiments of pioneer projectiles of vary \n\ning shapes and sizes; \n\nhollow driven faces; \n\n45 \n\noblique cutting edge; \n\nFIG. 2a-c are embodiments of pioneer projectiles with \n\nFIG.3a-dare embodiments of pioneer projectiles with an \n\nFIG. 4a-care embodiments of pioneer projectiles with an \n\noblique cutting edge and hollow driven faces: \n\nFIG.5a-care a plan view, side elevation and end elevation \nrespectively of a pioneer projectile with an oblique cutting \nedge; \n\nFIG. 6a-care a plan view, side elevation and end elevation \nrespectively of a pioneer projectile with a central piercing \npoint and faceted sides; \n\nFIG. 7a-care a plan view, side elevation and end elevation \nrespectively of a pioneer projectile with a central cutting \nedge; \n\nFIG. 8a-care a plan view, side elevation and end elevation \nrespectively of a pioneer projectile with a central piercing \npoint; \n\nFIG. 9 is one embodiment of an injectate of the invention \n\nshown housed in a Support or device chamber; \n\nFIG. 10 is another embodiment of an injectate of the inven \n\ntion shown housed in a Support or device chamber, \n\nFIG. 11 is another embodiment of an injectate of the inven \n\ntion shown housed in a Support or device chamber, \n\nFIG. 12 is another embodiment of an injectate of the inven \n\ntion shown housed in a Support or device chamber, \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n\fUS 8,574,188 B2 \n\n15 \nFIG. 13 is another embodiment of an injectate of the inven \n\ntion shown housed in a Support or device chamber; \n\nFIG. 14 is another embodiment of an injectate of the inven \n\ntion shown housed in a Support or device chamber; \n\nFIG. 15 is another embodiment of an injectate of the inven \n\ntion shown housed in a Support or device chamber; \n\nFIG. 16 is cross sectional view of a delivery device of the \n\ninvention; \n\nFIG. 17 is one embodiment of a reusable device according \nto one aspect of the invention with one embodiment of a \npackaged drug according to another aspect attached thereto, \nthe device being shown pre-use: \n\nFIGS.18a, b, and c illustrate a device substantially similar \n\nto the device illustrated in FIG. 17 in: \n\na) its assembled form \nb) at the point where it is fully primed and about to self \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\nactuate; and \n\nc) in its post actuation position; \nFIG. 19 is a packaged drug according to one aspect of the \ninvention in which the drug is in a Solid or otherwise con \ntained form and follows a pioneer projectile; \n\nFIG. 20 is a packaged drug according to another aspect of \nthe invention in which the drug is in a liquid form and is \nreleased and injected via a retractable needle; and \n\nFIG.21 is a packaged drug according to yet a further aspect \nof the invention in which the packaging is adapted to hold a \ndrug in a solid or liquid form and in which the end of the \npackaging is modified to be particularly well adapted to skin \ntensioning. \n\n25 \n\n16 \nOf course, the penetrating face 12 need not have a central \npoint and FIGS. 3a-d, and 4a-c illustrate embodiments in \nwhich the pioneer projectiles have an oblique cutting edge 24. \nThe shape of the penetrating face can, as noted above, take \na number of forms as exemplified with reference to FIGS.5-8. \nIn each of these Figsa) is a plan view; b) is a side elevation and \nc) is an end elevation. Thus: \n\nIn FIG. 5 the pioneer projectile is circular in X-section \n(FIG. 5a), has an oblique cutting edge 24 (FIG. 5b), and a \nplanar penetrating face 12 (FIG. 5c). \n\nIn FIG. 6 the pioneer projectile is circular in X-section \n(FIG. 6a), has a central point 26 (FIG. 6b), and four facets 28 \nmaking up the penetrating face 12 (FIG. 6c). \n\nIn FIG. 7 the pioneer projectile is circular in X-section \n(FIG. 7a), has a central cutting edge 30 (FIG. 7b), and two \nfacets 28 making up the penetrating face 12 (FIG. 7c). \n\nIn FIG. 8 the pioneer projectile is circular in X-section \n(FIG. 8a), has a conical penetrating face (FIG. 8b), culminat \ning in a point 30 and a penetrating face 12 (FIG. 8c). \n\nOf course the pioneer projectile need not be circular in \ncross section but could be, for example, three sided (triangu \nlar), four sided (square) or indeed any other Suitable shape. \nA pioneer projectile might be manufactured in a number of \nways such as by moulding, extrusion or sectioning a rod of the \nmaterial. \n\nPreferably the pioneer projectile will dissolve in the tissue \nin a matter of minutes or hours depending on the material \nused. \n\nThe pioneer projectile together with at least one therapeu \n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION \n\nReferring to the drawings, FIG. 1a is a side elevation of a \npioneer projectile 10 according to one aspect of the present \ninvention. It is made of a crystalline or amorphous material, \npreferably a glassy material, (e.g. a Sugar glass such as treha \nlose, palatinit, glucopyranosyl Sorbitol, glucopyranosyl man \nnitol, lactitol or monosaccharide alcohols such as mannitol or \ninositol) which is water-soluble and dissolves in the body. \nThe material may include a hardening agent, Such as, for \nexample, povidone (pvp). The pioneer projectile comprises a \npenetrating face 12 comprising one of more facets, which has \na central point, one or more guiding faces 16 for guiding the \npioneer projectile within a central aperture or chamber of a \nneedleless device for injecting an injectate (comprising the \npioneer projectile and a formulation) thus ensuring the pio \nneer projectile meets the skin at a Suitable angle to aid pen \netration, and a driven face 14. The pioneer projectile has an \naspect ratio (width W to height H) of about 1.25:1. \n\nThe pioneer projectile can however take a number of forms \nand some further embodiments are illustrated in FIG. 1b-d. \nFIG.2a-2c, FIG. 3a-d, FIG. 4a-c, FIG.5a-c, FIG. 6a-c; FIG. \n7a-C and FIG. 8a-c. \n\nBriefly: FIG. 1b illustrates a pioneer projectile with a very \nsmall aspect ratio of about 1:0.5: FIG. 1c illustrates a pioneer \nprojectile with an aspect ratio of about 1:2: FIG. 1d illustrates \na pioneer projectile with a blunt and planar penetrating face \n12, and an aspect ratio of about 1:0.2; and FIG. 1e illustrates \na pioneer projectile which does not have a guiding face 16 but \nconsists of a penetrating face 12 and a driven face 14. \n\nFIGS. 2a to 2c illustrate variations in the driven face 14. \nThus in FIG.2a the driven face is completely hollowed form \ning a Void 18 which can hold, at least in part, at least one \ntherapeutic compound or compound containing formulation. \nIn FIG.2b the hollow 18 has a flat bottom 20 and in FIG. 2C \nit has a concave bottom 22. \n\n30 \n\ntic compound or formulation forms an injectate. \n\nThe physical characteristics of the formulation are very \nimportant to ensure that the injectate can be administered to \nthe skin in a reliable and repeatable manner \n\nThe formulation could take a number of forms: \nIn one embodiment it might take the form of a paste. This \ncan be achieved by mixing the active drug with the appropri \nate excipients to end up with consistency, say, like toothpaste. \nThe excipients would obviously need to maintain the active \ningredient in a condition Such that it was still active during \nmanufacture, storage and administration. \n\nIn other embodiments the formulation will be a semi solid, \n\ngel, Solid or contained liquid. \n\nThe therapeutic component of the formulation might be \n\npresent in one or more of the following formats: \n1. Pure drug; \n2. With excipients to alter the physical characteristic of the \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\nmaterial; \n\n3. With excipients to bulk out the active ingredient; \n4. With excipients to buffer the active ingredient; \n5. With excipients to change the release profile of the active \n\n50 \n\ningredient; and \n\n6. As a mixture of more than one therapeutic compound. \n\nThe formulation can be designed to give the desired release \nprofile for the application. This might involve either a sus \ntained release formulation or a quick dissolving formulation \nfor immediate release into the body. In some cases, such as for \nthe administration of insulin, a formulation might be required \nthat provides an immediate release of some of the therapeutic \ncompound and thena Sustained release of another component \nin the formulation. This might for example be achieved by \nhaving the formulation in a plurality of parts or by incorpo \nrating a medicament into the pioneer projectile. \n\nAlternatively the therapeutic compound might be formu \nlated as small beads. A number of the beads could be lined up \nin the device behind a pioneer projectile. On actuation of the \ndevice the pioneer projectile pierces the skin and the beads are \npushed into the skin behind the pioneer projectile. \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n\fUS 8,574,188 B2 \n\n17 \nThe therapeutic component of the formulation must of \ncourse not react with the material used for the pioneer pro \njectile or the materials used in the delivery system. \n\nFIGS.9 to 15 are some embodiments illustrating injectates \n\nand formulations of the invention. \n\nIn FIG. 9 an injectate 40 comprises a pioneer projectile 10 \nand a formulation 42. The formulation is in a contained State \nsupported by its own viscosity or a membrane 44. The for \nmulation is thus a contained liquid or a solid. The injectate \nmay be self-supporting or contained in an optional Support 46 \nwhich may be a chamber 76 of a device or a throwaway \ncomponent. \n\nIn FIG. 10 the formulation is a high viscosity liquid, gel, \n\npaste or semi-solid. \n\nFIG. 11 illustrates an injectate comprising a plurality of \ndifferent formulations 42a, 42b and 42c. These could be \nformulations with different release profiles or different active \ningredients, for example combination therapies. Though not \nillustrated there could be membranes between the compo \nnents e.g. lipid soluble membranes between water-soluble \nformulations and or an end piece. \n\nFIGS. 12, 13 and 14 illustrate injectates with different solid \nformulations. In FIG. 12 the solid formulation takes the form \nofbeads 46. In FIGS. 13 and 14 they are granules, particles or \ncrystals 48. \n\nIn FIG. 15 a barrier 50 is shown between the formulation 42 \n\nand the pioneer projectile 10. \n\nThe skilled man will of course realise that the features \nillustrated with reference to one embodiment could easily be \napplied to other embodiments. \n\nAn injectate will be introduced into a human or animal \nusing a device that injects the injectate in a needleless manner. \nOne such device is illustrated by way of example only in \n\nFIG. 16. \n\nThe needleless injection device 60 is shown in the primed \nposition. It comprises an outer housing or holder 62 the low \nermost end 64 of which is slidably mounted over the upper \nmost end 66 of an innermost casing 68. \n\nAt the lowermost end 70 of innermost casing 68 is fitted a \ndisposable component 72 Such as, for example, a drug cas \nsette. The disposable component comprises a casing 74 hav \ning a central aperture or chamber 76 in which is mounted the \ninjectate 40 comprising the pioneer projectile 10 and the \nformulate 42. A large headed ejector pin 78 comprising a flat \nhead 80 and an elongate body 82 is positioned over the injec \ntate 40 so that when the ejector pin is contacted, in use, by a \nstriker 84 it is pushed along the aperture or chamber 76 and \nout into the patient. A resilient member 87, such as a rubber \nblock urges the ejector pin back a little after injection. \n\nThe disposable component 72 is loaded into the needleless \ninjection device, by for example, Screwing it into the lower \nmost end 70 of the inner housing 68. \n\nMounted within the innermost housing 68 is a striker guide \n86 having a surface 88 which maintains a detent 90 in the \nloaded position (shown) and houses an actuating mechanism \nor spring 92 and spring follower 94. \n\nThe disposable component 72 is shaped such that when it is \nin contact with the skin it pre-tensions it prior to actuation. \nThis ensures that the dosage will penetrate the skin rather than \njust stretch the skin. \n\nThe injector pin 78 is designed to push the injectate beyond \nthe end of the device by up to (say) 2.5 mm. This means that \nthe end of the injector pin (which preferably has the same \nprofile and diameter as the end of the pioneer projectile) \nmight just penetrate the skin but it would ensure that the \ninjectate has been fully administered into the skin. \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n18 \nPrior to actuation, the tip of the injectate might be in con \ntact with the skin. However, it is preferred that the tip is a few \nmillimeters away from the skin prior to  actuation.  This \nensures that the injectate is moving when it impacts the skin \nand also ensures that the tip of the injectate does not start to \ndissolve, and therefore soften the tip, with any moisture from \nthe skin surface when the device is placed on the skin. \n\nTo use the device 60 the outer most casing is retracted \n(pulled in the direction of arrow A) so that it slides against the \ninnermost housing 68. This action causes the spring 92 to be \ncompressed, and the detent to be moved from a vertical posi \ntion to the position shown where it  is held stable against \nsurface 88. In the process a quill spring 96 stabilises the detent \nby abutting against a surface 98. Once loaded the disposable \ncomponent, is screwed into the end 70 of the innermost hous \ning 68 of the device 60. \n\nThe injector pin 78 that pushes the injectate into the skin is \npreferably, (but not necessarily) in contact with the injectate \nprior to actuation. \n\nTo actuate the device a user, for example, grips the device \naround the outer housing 62 with their thumb over the end cap \n102. The end face 100 of the disposable component 72 is \npositioned against a patient\u2019s skin, which should be held \ntaught, and the outer housing 62 is pushed in a direction away \nfrom arrow A. This action causes the outermost casing to slide \nover the inner housing 68. As it does so the detent is caused to \nrotate about it's axle 104 as a result of the detent riding up \ninclined wall 106. This forces the quill spring 96 out (as \nshown by the broken line). When the detent reaches a vertical \nposition the coil spring releases its stored energy and assists in \nensuring the striker 84 travels along the striker guide 86 until \nit contacts the head 80 of the ejector pin 78 with a force that \ncauses the injectate 40 to pierce the skin. The ejector pin 78 \ncontinues to push the formulation 42 into the patient to the \nrequired depth, which is determined by the length of the \ninjectate and the extent to which it is pushed by the ejector pin \n78. The rubber stop 87 is squashed by the ejector pin head 80 \nduring delivery of the injectate but the elastic properties of the \nrubber stop 87 enable the tip of the ejector pinto be withdrawn \ninto the disposable component 72 of the device. \nInjection Sites \n\nThe injectate could potentially be injected in a wide num \nber of sites across the human or animal body. The easiest \ndirection to administer the injectate is perpendicular to the \nskin and so with most skin sites this would mean penetrating \nthe epidermis into the dermis and, depending on the skin \nthickness, into the subcutaneous layers or muscle. The best \ninjection sites might therefore be those where there is the \nSmallest density of nerve endings to avoid any pain that might \nbe associated with the injection. This might include injections \nto the back or to the lobe of the ear. \n\nAlternatively, injection sites might include those with a \nthicker epidermis so that the injectate does not penetrate into \nthe dermis where the nerve endings are located. The injectate \nmight be injected obliquely into the skin so that it is located \ntotally in the epidermis. The same result might beachieved by \ninjection into a fold of skin that has been pinched. \n\nThe elastic properties of the skin can be employed to seal \nthe skin after the injectate has been administered, as is often \nthe case with splinters. This ensures the drug does not leak \nfrom the skin as it dissolves. \n\nThe most likely area of the body for drug administration \nwith this technology is the stomach because of the high fat \ncontent and easy accessibility for self-administration. An \nalternative might be the thigh although this is often less acces \nsible if the recipient is wearing trousers. \n\n\fUS 8,574,188 B2 \n\n19 \n\nProduct Applications \n\nThere are many possible product applications for this tech \nnology because of the doses that are achievable including \ntherapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic applications. Illus \ntrative examples include, but are not limited to: \nConventional Vaccines\u2014first and third world applications or \n\n5 \n\nVeterinary applications; \n\nInsulin; \nMigraine Treatments; and \nHormones. \n\nThe term \u201cat least one therapeutic compound or a formu \nlation containing at least one therapeutic compound as used \nin this application is intended to cover prophylactic and diag \nnostic applications as well as therapeutic applications. \n\nThe maximum dose that could be delivered using the tech \nnique will depend upon a number of factors. However, an \ninjectate with an overall length of approximately 4.0 mm and \na diameter of approximately 1.0 mm (similar to a 19G ven \nflon) would be sufficient to allow a dose of approximately 2 \nmg of a standard therapeutic in one administration. This mag \nnitude of dose would be suitable for each of the applications \nexemplified above. If several doses of injectate are delivered \nsimultaneously then there is the potential for an even larger \nnumber of applications. \n\nDelivery of the injectate will be very quick and any pain \nassociated with the delivery technique should not be any \nworse than a needle of similar dimensions. If the delivery \ntechnique were painful then it would be possible to anaesthe \ntise the tissue prior to the injection. To avoid needles then this \nanaesthetic might be given with a patch, a spray or a cream. \nThe device illustrated in FIG. 17 is a (reusable) drug deliv \nery device (210), with a packaged drug (2100) fitted thereto. \nIt comprises very few components. They include \ni) a housing (212); \nii) a means (214) for generating a force capable of pushing a \ndrug (216) from a packaging (218) into a human or animal \nbody; \n\niii) a means (220) for transmitting said force to push the drug \n(216) from the packaging (218) into the human or animal \nbody; \n\niv) a means (222) for receiving a packaged drug (2100); \nV) a means (224) for priming the device; and \nvi) a means (238.242b) for triggering the device. \n\nIn the embodiment shown the device is primed and trig \n\ngered in a single action. \n\nThe delivery device (210) which may be absent of the \npackaged drug (2100) is spring powered. It can deliver the \ndrug or a formulation containing a therapeutic compound \n(hereafter drug) in a solid, semi-solid or liquid form. By \naltering the form of the packaged drug (2100) the device can \nbe used to either deliver drugs through a retractable needle \n(FIG. 20), or behind a \u201cpioneer projectile\u201d (FIGS. 19 and 21). \nIt can also be used to deliver a solid drug splinter. \n\nLooking at the device in more detail it comprises a number \nof components which are readily assembled and easily steri \nlised making manufacture cheap. \n\nThe body of the device comprises a three part housing \n(212) comprising a first housing component (212a) defining \nan upper barrel (228) which houses the force generating \nmeans (214), a second housing component (212b) defining a \nlower barrel (230) which houses the packaged drug (2100) \nand the means (220) for transmitting the force to push the \ndrug (216) from its packaging (218). The first and second \nhousing components (212a: 212b) connect to one another, \nand a third housing component (212c), which preferably \ntakes the form of a screw cap (232), fits over the end of the first \nhousing component to close off the upper barrel (228). \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n20 \nWithin the upper barrel (228) is fitted the means (214) for \ngenerating the force capable of pushing the drug (216) from \nits packaging. In the embodiment shown this takes the form of \na mechanical coil spring which can generate a force of from \nabout 10-40N, more preferably 15-35 N and most preferably \n18-31 N. The spring is connected at its lower end to a spring \nfollower (236) which is slidably mounted in the upper barrel \n(228). Above the spring is a compression bar (234) which \nprovides a contact Surface against which the spring can act. \nBy screwing or unscrewing the cap (232) from the housing \ncomponent (212a) the spring can be caused to compress or \nrelax thereby providing a means for adjusting the force that \ncan be generated by it.  In FIG. 17 the spring is shown at \nminimum pre-load. \n\nThe upper barrel (228) and lower barrel (230) are separated \nfrom one another by a wall (242) with a communicating \naperture (243) therein and it is on the upper surface (242a) of \nthis wall that the spring follower (236) sits. The means (220) \nfor transmitting the force generated by the spring takes the \nform of an impact hammer one end (220a) of which passes \nthrough the communicating aperture (243) where it contacts \nspring follower (236). In use the uppermost end (220a) of the \nimpact hammer slides through the communicating aperture \n(243) pushing the spring follower (236) up the upper barrel \n(228) causing the spring to be compressed thus priming the \ndevice. \n\nWithin the lower barrel is housed not only the majority of \nthe impact hammer (220), but a slewing spring (244) and a \nsliding piston (248) having an aperture (246) therein, Such \nthat the lower barrel can operatively communicate with the \npackaged drug (2100) which is secured to the device via the \nreceiving means (222) provided at the devices lowermost end \n(249). \n\nThe slewing spring functions to draw the longitudinal axis \nof the impact hammer off centre (FIG.18a) in the devices rest \nposition. However, the hammer is adapted by way of a shaped \nshoulder region (238), (which in a preferred embodiment is \nsubstantially frustoconical, as illustrated) to be drawn into \naxial alignment with the aperture (246) in the sliding piston, \nagainst the action of the slewing spring (244). Such that when \nit is fully primed the device automatically actuates. Accord \ningly the lowermost surface (242b) of the wall (242) is shaped \nto receive the shaped shoulder region (238) of the impact \nhammer and cause the impact hammer to be axially aligned \nwith the aperture (246) in the sliding piston (248) such that it \nis driven by the spring (214) through the aperture (246) in the \nsliding piston (248) where it contacts a drive pin (2108) or \nother element causing the drug (216) to be pushed out of its \npackaging (218) into the human or animal. In contrast with \nthe FIG. 17 embodiment it should also be noted that the end \n(220a) of the impact hammer graduates to a point (being \nSubstantially conical) and is seated in a similarly shaped \nrecess (236a) in the spring follower (236). The shaping of the \nhammer end (220a) and the provision of the similarly shaped \nrecess (236a) in the spring follower (236) further improves \nreliability of actuation. \n\nBy comparison of FIG. 18a with FIGS. 18b and c it will be \napparent that once a packaged drug (2100) has been attached \nto the lower most end (249) of the device (210) it can be \nactuated by a user holding the device about it\u2019s housing (212) \nand pressing the device (210) firmly against the patients skin. \nThis causes first the skin to be tensioned and then the pack \naged drug (2100) slides up the lower chamber (230) pushing \nthe piston (248) which in turn pushes the impact hammer \n(220). As it  does so the upper end (220a) of the impact \nhammer pushes against the spring follower (236) causing the \nspring (214) to be compressed until the necessary drive force \n\n\fUS 8,574,188 B2 \n\n21 \nis reached. This is at the point illustrated in FIG. 18b. At this \npoint the shaped shoulder region. (238) is drawn into the \nshaped lowermost surface (242b) of wall (242), the action of \nthe slewing spring (244) is countered, the spring (214) is fully \ncharged and the impact hammer (220) axially aligned with the \naperture (246) in the sliding piston (248) such that it will \nautomatically actuate, the spring (214) forcing the impact \nhammer (220) through the aperture (246) in the piston (248) \ncausing it to push the drive pin (2108) which in turn, depend \ning on the mechanism employed in the packaged drug (2100) \n(see FIGS. 19 to 21) causes the drug to be dispensed into the \nhuman or animal. Significantly the longitudinal axis of the \nimpact hammer can\u2019t be aligned with the aperture (246) in the \nsliding piston (248) until it reaches the set actuating force \nwhich is set to coincide with the point at which the shaped \nshoulder region (238) contacts the shaped lowermost surface \n(242b) of wall (242) thus providing a safety  mechanism \nagainst accidental actuation. When it reaches this point trig \ngering is automatic and the device is actuated (FIG. 18c). \n\nIt should be noted that on actuation the hammer moves only \na short distance, less than 10 mm, more preferably less than 5 \nmm and typically about 3 mm before impacting the drive pin \nand therefore moves (say) approx 5 mm before the pioneer \nprojectile strikes the skin. This means that the maximum \nforce and impact are all in the first few millimeters of travel, \nwhen the maximum force is  required to pierce the skin. \nThrough the rest of the delivery, the force is reducing as the \nmain spring power is diminishing and also the slewing spring \nis being compressed (FIG. 18c). This means that the force \ntapers off during the second half of the delivery when less \nforce is required. \n\nTherefore the force profile through the whole delivery \nmatches the requirements i.e.  a high force and impact to \npierce the skin and then a reduced force to push the injectate \ninto the skin. \n\nIn the case of a reusable device the packaged drug is \nremoved from the device and discarded. The slewing spring \nwill assist in this action. As the packaged drug (2100) is \nremoved from the device the slewing spring (244) acts to \ndraw the impact hammer (220) so that it is not axially aligned \nwith the aperture (246) in the piston (248) and the device \n(210) is ready to receive a new packaged drug. \n\nSuch a device can be used to dispense a drug in a variety of \n\ndifferent forms depending on how it is packaged. \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\nTo demonstrate the versatility of the device three different \ndesigns (FIGS. 19, 20, and 21) of packaged drug (2100) are \nillustrated  as  suitable  for use with  the device. All  three \nembodiments illustrate the dispensing of a single dose but the \nskilled man will appreciate that multi-doses could also be \ndispensed simultaneously or sequentially with the device of 50 \nthe invention. Similarly, the device could be produced in a \npre-primed form with the packaged drug forming an integral \npart of the device. \n\nReferring to FIG. 19, in one embodiment the packaged \ndrug (2100) takes the form of an end piece which is adapted \nto be slidably mountable in the device (210). The packaging \n(218) takes the form of a two-piece housing (2.18a, 218b). \nthereby simplifying construction and assembly. A first hous \ning element (218a) is the shape of a hollow inverted \u201cT\u201d and \ncomprises a region (2102) (the stem of the \u201cT\u201d) which serves \nin use to slidably engage the device (210) allowing the pack \naged drug to slide up the lower chamber (230) of the device \n(210), and a \u201ccross piece  against which the second element \n(218b) abuts. A central channel (2106a) runs through the \nmiddle of the stem exiting at the crosspiece. The second \nelement (218b) comprises an end (2104) which is shaped to \ntension the skin. The second element (218b) is also substan \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n22 \ntially the shape of an inverted T and has a channel (2106b) \nrunning down the centre axis of the inverted T. The respective \nchannels (2106a, 2106b) communicate with one another to \nform a single channel (2106) which runs right through the \npackaging (218). The channel (2106b) houses a pioneer pro \njectile (2110) and the drug (216) or a drug splinter (effectively \n2110, 216), the skin contacting end of which is set a few \nmillimeters in from the skin tensioning surface of the device \nto ensure it is moving at the requisite speed when it contacts \nthe skin. It also houses the lower end (2108b) of the drive pin \n(2108). At the end remote from the skin tensioning surface the \nchannel (2106b) opens out to house a resilient member e.g. a \nspring (2114). The placing of a resilient member under the \nhead (2108a) of the drive pin allows the drive pin to be \nwithdrawn backinto the housing immediately after actuation. \nThe drive pin (2108) is slidably mounted in the channel \n(2106) so that when the head is depressed by the hammer of \nthe device the drive pin moves down the channel pushing the \npioneer projectile and drug (2110, 2216) from the channel \n(106b) into the human or animal body. The pioneer projectile \n(2110) and drug (216) are held in place in the channel (2106b) \nby, for example, a breakable membrane (not shown) or appro \npriate frictional means e.g. one or more markings or splines \non either the pioneer projectile, drug and or channel (2106b) \nSurface. \n\nThe packaged drug illustrated in FIG. 19 is suitable for the \ninjection of a \u201ccontained  drug behind a pioneer projectile \nwhich can penetrate the skin and create a channel into which \nthe drug is pushed as described. This type of packaged drug is \nalso suitable for the administration of drug splinters or rods of \na solid therapeutic compound which have a sharp tip as per \nWO 94/22423. The therapeutic compound or therapeutic \ncompound and tip are initially located in the channel (2106) \nof the packaging (218). The distal end (2108b) of the drive pin \nmay or may not be in contact with the uppermost end of the \ntherapeutic compound prior to actuation. When the drive pin \nhead (2108a) is struck by the impact hammer the drive pin \n(2108) pushes the therapeutic compound (and pioneer pro \njectile, if included) into the target tissue. \n\nThe end of the drive pin may just penetrate the outer layers \nof the skin to ensure that the therapeutic compound is com \npletely delivered into the skin. Alternatively, the packaged \ndrug may include a short rod (or rods) of a placebo or phar \nmaceutical compound between the end of the drive pin and \nthe therapeutic compound, which can be used to push the \ntherapeutic compound fully into the skin. In this case it would \nnot matter if the placebo rods entered the skin but it would \nensure that the drive pin did not have to penetrate the skin. The \nbenefits of this are that the drive pin would not be left pro \ntruding from the packaged drug following the administration \nand would not be contaminated with bodily fluids and it \nwould therefore not pose a health risk in terms of disposal. An \nalternative is to include a piece of rubber or foam, or as \nillustrated a light spring (2114), under the head (2108a) of the \ndrive pin to ensure that the tip of the drive pin is withdrawn \ninto the spent packaging after administration. \n\nFIG. 20 illustrates an alternative design of a packaged drug \nfor use with a device according to the invention. The pack \naged drug comprises a two piece housing (218a, 218b) which \nis identical to that of the FIG. 19 embodiment. This simplifies \nmanufacture as the housing components can be used for a \npackaged drug which is solid (as per the FIG. 19 embodi \nment) or one which is liquid. In order to be adapted to dis \npense a liquid a needle (2112) sits in the channel (2106), its \nlower end (2112b) being in the channel (2106b) of housing \ncomponent (218b) and its upper end (2112a) extending into \nthe channel (2106a) of housing component (218b). The \n\n\fUS 8,574,188 B2 \n\n23 \nneedle (2112) is obliquely cut at both ends to provide sharp \npoints. Attached to the upper end (2112a) of the needle is a \nsupport plate (2113) on which is seated a resilient or com \npressible spacer (2126) which extends above the tip of the \nupper end (2112a) of the needle. Seated on the spacer (2126)  5 \nimmediately above the tip of the needle (2112) is a liquid drug \ncontaining receptacle (2120). The receptacle comprises one \nor more side walls (2121) and a puncturable base (2122) \nwhich together define a receptacle cavity which is filled with \nthe drug (216) through an opening (2124). The receptacle is  10 \nsealed by a drive pin or element (2108) which sits in the \nreceptacle opening (2124). \n\nIn use the hammer of the drug delivery device contacts the \ndrive element head (2108a) causing the receptacle to be \npushed down the channel (2106a) of the housing element  15 \n(218a). The spacer (2126) is compressed causing the needle \nto puncture the base (2122). Consequently the needle (2112) \nis filled by some of the drug contents (216) of the receptacle \nthereby expelling air from the needle prior to piercing of the \nskin and delivery of the drug. The force exerted on the support  20 \nplate (2113) forces the needle into the skin where the liquid \ndrug contents (216) drain into the human or animal through \nthe tract formed by the needle (2112). As the user of the \ndevice removes the device from the skin, the drug package is \npushed substantially out of the end of the device by the action  25 \nof the slewing spring, and the needle is withdrawn into the \ndrug package by the action of the spring (2114). \n\nIn yet a further embodiment, and as illustrated in FIG. 21 \nthere is a packaged drug (2100) which is adapted to hold a \ndrug (216) in any state, liquid, semi Solid or Solid. As in the  30 \nprevious embodiments the housing (218) preferably takes the \nform of a two piece housing (218a, 218b)although in this case \nthe housing elements are  shaped differently.  In  channel \n(2106b) of the second housing element (218b) is housed a \npioneer projectile (2110) and the lowermost part of a drug 35 \ncontaining receptacle (2120) in the form of a thin walled \nmetal  tube which is  sealed with a breakable membrane \n(2122). The tube terminates at its uppermost end in a lip \n(2121) on which rest a pair of flexible arms (2128) of a drive \nelement (2108). The receptacle is sealed by the drive element 40 \n(2108). At the end remote from the skin tensioning surface of \nthe second housing element (218b) is  a ramped Surface \n(2130). The uppermost part of the drug containing receptacle \n(2120) and the drive element (2108) sit in a cavity between the \nhousing elements (218a, 218b) and which can be considered 45 \nan extension of channel (2106a) formed in the first housing \nelement (218a). The end (2104) in this embodiment is par \nticularly well Suited to skin tensioning and includes an annu \nlar ring (2105) located immediately about the channel (2106) \nexit. The annular ring in this embodiment is about 3 mm in  50 \ndiameter (including the channel which is about 1  mm in \ndiameter) and depth. By way of comparison the end (2104) \nhas a diameter of about 16 mm. The depth and width need not \nbe 3 mm by 3 mm but should generally be in the range 1.5 mm \nto 6 mm. Any more than this and it  may cause pain and 55 \nbruising and any less than this and it  may not adequately \ntension the skin. This annular ring which may be a whole ring \nor a broken ring comprising a number of projecting elements \ndisposed in a substantially annular fashion about the channel \nexit could be a feature of any embodiment. To simplify con-  60 \nstruction in this embodiment the drive pin head (2108a) is \nproduced as separate component to the lower and elongate \nend (2108b) of the drive pin. \n\nIn use the hammer of the drug delivery device contacts the \ndrive element head (2108a) causing the receptacle to be  65 \npushed down the channel (2106b) as a consequence of the \nforce exerted by the flexible arms (2128) of the drive element \n\n24 \n(2108) against the lip (2121) of the receptacle (2120). This \ncauses the pioneer projectile (2110) to be pushed into the \npatient. Once the pioneer projectile has entered the patient the \nflexible arms (2128) of the drive element (2108) contact the \nramp surface (2130) of the second housing element (218b) \nand are caused to flex apart and ride over the lip (2121) and/or \nsnap. As a consequence the lower part (2108b) of the drive \nelement is able to move down the receptacle (2120) pushing \nthe drug (216) contents out into a tract formed by the pioneer \nprojectile (2110). Preferably the end of the receptacle which \ntakes the form of a thin walled tube just enters the skin before \nthe drug is delivered. This ensures that if a liquid drug is used \nthe drug follows the pioneer projectile into the skin rather \nthan escaping along the skin Surface. \n\nThe main advantage of the FIG. 21 embodiment is for the \ninjection of liquids as it ensures that the liquid is contained \nduring the administration and is guided by the thin walled \nmetal tube into the target tissue. However, the drug contents \nneed not be restricted to liquids. \n\nA feature of the device illustrated which further distin \nguishes it from other hand powered systems is that the force \ngenerated by the spring is the delivery force and there is \nSubstantially no additional force generated by the operator \ndue to the gradual priming and instantaneous actuation when \nthe device reaches the delivery force set. \n\nIn contrast devices which include a breaktab or other snap \nmeans to actuate the device can\u2019t have the force carefully \ncontrolled and as a consequence the greater the force exerted \nby the user the greater the velocity of impact by the drug with \nthe skin. \n\nWith the system detailed in this application the hand force \ncompresses the main spring to a preset point at which the drug \npackage is inserted to virtually its maximum point within the \ndevice. At this point the actuation takes place and the prede \ntermined spring strength delivers the drug. Any extra force by \nthe hand is dissipated over the whole of the area of the end of \nthe device. \n\nAn alternative way of viewing this is to consider the skinas \na sponge. In devices utilising Snap tabs, when the Snap tabs \nare broken all the force by the hand is pushing the drug and the \nresilience of the skin will start to push the bottom half of the \ndevice (part not held in hand) back towards the hand. This \nmay result in a less good seal with the skin and, in theory, if \nthe hand force stops immediately the Snap tabs are broken \nthen the drug would never be pushed from the device - they \nrely on the inertia in the hand to make the injection. In practice \nthis means that the user pushes and pushes and then Suddenly \nthe tabs break and the device is pushed into the target possibly \ncausing pain and bruising with the device. In the present \ninjection the skin is compressed by a steady hand force. At the \npoint of actuation the main spring controls the delivery of the \ndrug and the hand maintains (but does not Suddenly increase) \nthe force on the skin to ensure a good contact with the skin. If \nat any point before actuation the sensation on the skin is \npainful then the injection site can be altered or the injection \naborted rather than causing further pain and/or bruising. \n\nDevices of the type described have been demonstrated by \nthe applicant to be capable of delivering a drug as demon \nstrated by the following examples: \n\nEXAMPLES \n\nInitial experiments were carried out with non pharmaceu \ntical materials to demonstrate the delivery concept. These \nexperiments comprised the following: \n\n\fUS 8,574,188 B2 \n\n25 \nExample 1 \n\nDrug Splinters \n\nA rod of 0.9 mm diameter pencil lead was broken to lengths \nof approximately 6 mm and a point was sanded on one end of \neach length and a flat on the other to create solid splinters. The \nsplinters were placed in the drug package shown in FIG. 19 \nand Successfully administered to pig skin using a prototype \ndelivery system. \n\nExample 2 \n\nPioneer Projectile Followed by a Solid Rod \n\nThe same pencil lead detailed in example 1 above was cut \ninto short lengths of approximately 3 mm in length. These had \na point Sanded on one end and a flat on the other end to create \npioneer projectiles. Further rods of the same pencil lead were \ncut at approximately 4 mm in length and had both ends Sanded \nflat. When a pioneer projectile and a solid rod were placed in \na drug package as shown in FIG. 19 they were successfully \nadministered to pig skin using a prototype delivery system. \nExample 3 \n\n25 \n\nPioneer Projectile Followed by a Soft Rod \n\nA soft rod of wax was extruded through a die and rods of \napproximately 4 mm in length were cut with a flat at each end. \nFurther sections were cut with a point at one end and a flat at \nthe other end. When a pointed section (identical in shape and \nsize to the splinter used in example 1) was administered to pig \nskin using a drug package as shown in FIG. 19 the wax did not \npierce the skin but was flattened on the skin surface. When a \nrod of the same waxy material was placed behind a pioneer \nprojectile used in example 2 and administered to pig skin \nusing a drug package as shown in FIG. 19 then both the \npioneer projectile and the waxy material were successfully \ndelivered into  the tissue. The wax material used for this \nexperiment could easily be squashed between a finger and a \nthumb. \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\nExample 4 \n\nPioneer Projectile Followed by Solid Beads. \n\nBeads of diameters 0.5-0.75 mm were placed in a drug \npackage, as shown in FIG. 19, behind a pioneer projectile as \ndetailed in example 2. The pioneer projectile and all the beads \nwere successfully administered to pig skin using a prototype \ndelivery system. \n\nThe experiments outlined above demonstrated that a range \nof different materials could be delivered behind a solid pio \nneer projectile. Ideally it is preferred that the pioneer projec \ntile is manufactured from pharmaceutical grade compounds \nthat will dissolve in the target tissue. Two processes have been \nused to produce Such pioneer projectiles as outlined below: \nExample 5 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\nA hot melt of Sugars is produced which can then be moul \nded into the correct form for a pioneer projectile or extruded \nto produce long rod. If an extrusion process is used then the \npioneer projectiles can be cut to shape from the Soft extrudate \nor the sharp ends of the pioneer projectile can beformed when \nthe extrudate has solidified. This process produces a material \n\n30 \n\nsaid upper barrel; \n\n26 \nsimilar to a boiled sweet which can be very hard and incor \nporate a sharp point on one end. \n\nExample 6 \n\nA mix of powders is produced using pharmaceutical grade \nSugars together with a hardening agent such as polyvinylpy \nrolidone (PVP). The powder blend is extruded through a die \nto produce a long rod of the compound. Some blends require \na lubricant to facilitate the extrusion and binding process Such \nas water or ethanol. The pioneer projectiles are formed by \ncutting the long rod into short sections. This process can be \nfacilitated by using a hot knife. If necessary, the point or flat \nend of the pioneer projectile can be created by Sanding or \nfiling a short rod of the extrudate. \n\nWe claim: \n1.

This appli \ncation is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n10 \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nThis disclosure is generally in the field of implantable \nmedical  devices.  In  particular,  the  disclosure  relates  to \nimplantable devices for drug release over an extended period. \nImplantable devices for the delivery of drugs to patients \nover extended periods are known. U.S. Pat. No. 5,797,898, \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,527,762, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,491,666, and \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,976,982 describe devices for the storage and \ncontrolled release of drug formulations from multi-reservoir \ndevices. One category of the devices provide passive con \ntrolled release of multiple, individual doses of drug. The \nreservoirs contain a release system which comprises a drug. \nThat is, the release system of each reservoir can be individu \nally  programmed,  e.g.,  formulated, to provide selected \nkinetics of drug release, controlling both the time at which \nrelease is initiated and the rate at which the drug is released. \nRelease from different reservoirs can be staggered to provide \ncomplex release profiles. Reservoir caps may be provided to \nclose off reservoir openings until Such time as release of the \ndrug is desired.  Reservoir caps are designed to passively \ndisintegrate or become permeable in Vivo to initiate drug \nrelease. \n\nIt would be desirable to provide improved designs of such \nimplantable devices for therapeutic or prophylactic treat \nments. It would in particular be desirable to provide small \ndevices for precise, local (e.g., pinpoint) delivery of a drug \nover an extended period precisely to selected tissue sites, \nwherein the device has a relatively high drug volume to device \nVolume ratio and can be implanted into a patient by a mini \nmally invasive technique. It would be further desirable to \nprovide devices having a relatively simple design that can be \nreadily fabricated and assembled from relatively few compo \nnentS. \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\nSUMMARY \n\n50 \n\nEmbodiments of the present devices and methods address \nat least some of the foregoing needs. In one aspect, a drug \ndelivery device is provided that includes at least two housing \nunits connected together end-to-end in a fixed, linear orien \ntation, each housing unit having an exterior Surface and an \ninterior surface, and the exterior surfaces of the connected \nhousing units defining a sidewall of the device. At least two \ndiscrete dose units, each comprising a drug formulation com \nprising at least one drug, are disposed within each of the \nhousing units. At least one degradable timing member is \nconnected to the at least two housing units and separates the \ndiscrete dose units from one another. A first end piece defines \na first end of the device while a second end piece defines a \nsecond end of the device distal to the first end of the device. \nThe discrete dose units are located between the first and \nsecond end pieces within each of the housing units. The \ndevice, when deployed in vivo, is adapted to release a first of 65 \nthe discrete dose units following rupture of the first or second \nend piece, and Subsequently to release a second of the discrete \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n2 \ndose units following rupture of the degradable timing mem \nber separating the first and second discrete dose units. \n\nIn another aspect, methods are provided for administering \na drug to a patient. In one embodiment, the method includes \ninjecting or otherwise inserting one or more of the above \ndescribed drug delivery devices into a tissue site in a patient \nand thereafter releasing the at least one discrete dose unit \nfrom the device to the tissue site. \n\nIn still another aspect, an implantable drug delivery device \nis provided that includes at least two Solid units of a drug \nformulation which comprises at least one drug. The Solid \nunits each have a proximal end, a distal end, and one or more \nlongitudinal exterior surfaces therebetween. At least one seal \nmember is sandwiched between the proximal end of a first of \nthe solid units and the distal end of a second of the solid units. \nA coating layer covers at least the longitudinal exterior Sur \nfaces of the Solid units and is substantially non-permeable, \nsuch that release of the drug from the first or second solid unit \nis  controlled at least in part, and preferably primarily or \nexclusively, by the in vivo disintegration of the seal member. \n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n\nFIG. 1A is a perspective view of an embodiment of an \nimplantable drug delivery device.

The targeted \ntissue location may be, for example, a lumen other than the \nvasculature, Subcutaneous space, intramuscular, in a specific \norgan/tumor mass, peritoneal cavity, duodenum, intracranial \ncavity or brain tissue, or pleural space. The entire implantable \ndrug delivery device is completely implanted into the targeted \ntissue or tissues, as distinct from a catheter, at least a portion \nof which generally protrudes/extends from the patient\u2019s body. \nAlternatively, the drug delivery device may be sized and \nshaped for oral administration. Embodiments of the drug \n\n\fUS 8,679,093 B2 \n\n3 \ndelivery  devices  described  herein  advantageously  are \ndesigned to provide a hermetic drug delivery device that is \nSuitable for being packaged (e.g., in a sterile metal foil) and \nstored for a prolonged period of time (e.g., months to years) \nprior to being opened and implanted into the body of a patient. \nDevice Body and Structure \n\nGenerally described, an embodiment of an implantable \ndrug delivery device comprises at least two housing units \nconnected together end-to-end in a fixed, linear orientation. \nIn exemplary embodiments, the devices have two or more \ndiscrete dose units of drug formulation disposed therein. Each \nhousing unit has an exterior Surface and an interior Surface, \nthe exterior Surfaces of the connected housing units defining \na sidewall of the device.  The housing units are located \nbetween a first end piece defining a first end of the device and \na second end piece defining a second end of the device distal \nto the first end of the device. At least two discrete dose units \nare disposed within the housing units located between the first \nand second end pieces.  The device may further include \ndegradable timing members connected to the housing units, \ne.g., connecting adjacent housing units, and separating the \ndiscrete dose units from one another. In embodiments, the \nfirst and second end pieces comprise degradable timing mem \nbers. The timing members, the first end piece/degradable \ntiming member/second end piece, and the interior Surface of \nthe housing unit to which the first end piece/degradable tim \ning member/second end piece is connected together define a \nreservoir in which one of the dose units is disposed. \n\nDesirably, the device is configured to control the release of \neach discrete dose unit when the device is deployed in vivo. \nFor example, in an embodiment the device may be adapted to \nrelease a first discrete dose unit following rupture of the first \nor second end piece, and Subsequently to release a second \ndiscrete dose unit following rupture of a degradable timing \nmember. The device may release one or more additional \ndiscrete dose units following rupture of one or more addi \ntional degradable timing members. The dose unit may be a \ndrug provided with or without excipients and with or without \na matrix material. \n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the drug contains very little or \nno excipient in order to maximize the amount of drug per \nVolume of the dose unit. For example, the dose unit may \ncontain between 85 and 99 percent drug, e.g., 90 to 95 percent \ndrug, with the remainder being one or more excipients useful \nfor forming Solid units. Such as tablets. \n\nIn another exemplary embodiment, an implantable drug \ndelivery device comprises at least two solid units of a drug \nformulation which comprises at least one drug. The Solid \nunits each have a proximal end, a distal end, and one or more \nlongitudinal exterior surfaces therebetween. At least one seal \nmember is sandwiched between the proximal end of a first \nSolid unit and the distal end of a second Solid unit. A coating \nlayer that is substantially non-permeable covers at least the \nlongitudinal exterior surfaces of the solid units. Desirably, the \ndevice is adapted to control the release of the drug from the \nsolid units at least in part by the in vivo disintegration of the \nseal member. In particular embodiments, the coating layer is \nadapted to disintegrate in Vivo after the in vivo disintegration \nof the seal member and release of the drug from the plurality \nof solid units. \n\nThe devices provided herein may be any shape and size \nSuitable for delivery in a minimally invasive manner. In par \nticular embodiments the device is elongated in shape, a non \nlimiting example of which includes a substantially tubular (or \ncylindrical) shape. As used herein, the term \u201celongated\u201d is \nused broadly to include without limitation a shape wherein \nthe longitudinal axis is longer than a lateral axis of the device. \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n4 \nIt  should be understood  that  there  are  many elongated \nimplantable device geometries that could embody the con \ncept of employing the discrete dose units described herein, \nand is not limited to a Substantially tubular design. In a pre \nferred embodiment, the device is in the form of a straight, \nrigid, elongated tube. \n\nAny suitable number of reservoirs (including the housing \nunits, dose units, and degradable timing members/seal mem \nbers) may be disposed in the devices provided herein. Desir \nably, the device comprises a sufficient number of reservoirs \nhaving a fill ratio of drug formulation volume to device vol \nume of greater than about 50% (e.g., greater than about 55%, \ngreater than about 60%, greater than about 75%, or greater \nthan about 85%). In particular embodiments, the device com \nprises at least two reservoirs. In other particular embodi \nments, the device comprises from two to fifty reservoirs. In \nstill other embodiments the device comprises from three to \ntwenty dose reservoirs, from three to ten reservoirs, or from \nfive to ten dose reservoirs (e.g., seven reservoirs). More or \nfewer reservoirs are also envisioned. The reservoirs within a \nsingle device may be the same size. Alternatively, Some res \nervoirs may be larger than others. For example, the first dose \nmay be larger, functioning as a bolus to drive the drug con \ncentration to a therapeutically effective level, and Subsequent \ndoses are Smaller and serve as maintenance doses. Alterna \ntively, the first dose or first few doses may be smaller than \nSubsequent doses, for example, for the purpose of \u201cweaning \nthe patient to the drug. \nHousing Units \n\nIn embodiments, the two or more housing units form a \nsidewall of the drug delivery device. The sidewall may be \nformed using a material that is relatively non-permeable to \nthe bodily fluids over the duration of drug release. As used \nherein, the term \u201cnon-permeable\u201d refers to a material that \nsubstantially prevents the movement of fluids and molecules \nthrough the material for the duration of drug delivery. For \nexample, in particular embodiments the sidewalls are formed \nof a material that is substantially non-permeable for at least \none week, for at least two weeks, or longer, when deployed in \nvivo. In some embodiments, the sidewall also aids in protect \ning the drug from exposure to moisture and/or oxygen during \nshipping and storage of the device before use. \n\nIn particular embodiments, the housing units are formed of \na biocompatible polymer. In a preferred embodiment, the \nhousing units are formed of a bioerodible polymer. As used \nherein, the term \u201cbioerodible\u201d refers to a material that even \ntually is absorbed by the body, for example by the conversion \nof a material that initially is insoluble in aqueous systems into \na material that is soluble in aqueous systems or by hydrolysis \nor enzymatic cleavage of the polymer. The term \u201cbioerodible' \nincludes materials that degrade in vivo by \u201csurface erosion.\u201d \n\u201cbiodegradation' and/or \u201cbioresorption\u201d as understood in the \nart. Non-limiting examples of bioerodible polymers include \npoly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), or poly(lactic-co-gly \ncolic  acid)S,  and poly(anhydride-co-imides).  In  another \nembodiment, the housing units may be constructed of a non \nbioerodible material. Such as polycarbonate, liquid crystal \npolymer, polyimide, polyurethane, or a combination thereof. \nDose Units/Solid Units and Drug Formulations \n\nThe two or more dose units/solid units comprise at least \none drug and/or drug formulation. A drug formulation is a \ncomposition that comprises a drug. As used herein, the term \n'drug  includes any therapeutic or prophylactic agent (e.g., \nan active pharmaceutical ingredient or API). The drug formu \nlation may include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable \nexcipients, which are known in the art. \n\n\fUS 8,679,093 B2 \n\n5 \nDepending on the particular device embodiment, the drug \nformulation may be in essentially any form, Such as a pure \nSolid, a semi-solid, a pure liquid, a gel or hydrogel, a solution, \nan emulsion, a slurry, or a suspension. In a preferred embodi \nment, the drug formulation is in a monolithic, dry solid form, \nor in the form of a collection of particles (e.g., microparticles \nor nanoparticles), particularly for purposes of maintaining or \nextending the stability of the drug over a commercially and \nmedically useful time, e.g., during storage in a drug delivery \ndevice until the drug needs to be administered. These solid \nforms may be provided by lyophilization of a drug solution or \nsuspension directly in the reservoirs. Alternatively, prefabri \ncated pellets or microtablets that are approximately the size of \nindividual reservoirs may be formed outside the device (e.g., \nin a mold) and Subsequently loaded into the device, for \nexample, in an inert gas environment. The particular formu \nlation in the reservoirs of a single device may be the same as \nor different from one another across a plurality of the reser \nVoirs. \n\nThe drug formulation may include a drug in combination \nwith other materials to control or enhance the rate and/or time \nof release from the device. In various embodiments, the drug \nformulation further includes one or more matrix materials. In \none example, the matrix material comprises one or more \nsynthetic polymers. Exemplary materials include synthetic \npolymers, such as  PLGA, PEG, PLLA, and/or naturally \noccurring polymers such as hyaluronic acid, chitosan, and \nalginate. The natural-occurring polymers may or may not be \ncrosslinked by methods known to the art. In another example, \nthe one or more matrix materials comprise a biodegradable, \nbioerodible, water-soluble, or water-swellable matrix mate \nrial. In one embodiment, the therapeutic or prophylactic agent \nis distributed in the matrix material and the matrix material \ndegrades or dissolves in vivo to controllably release the thera \npeutic or prophylactic agent. The therapeutic or prophylactic \nagent may be heterogeneously distributed in the dose unit/ \nSolid unit or may be homogeneously distributed in the dose \nunit/solid unit. The degradation, dissolution, or diffusion \nproperties of the matrix material can provide a means for \ncontrolling the release rate of the drug molecules. \n\nThe drug may comprise Small  molecules, large  (i.e., \nmacro-) molecules, or a combination thereof. In one embodi \nment, the large molecule drug is a protein or a peptide. \n\nRepresentative examples of Suitable drugs include vac \ncines, vectors for gene therapy, polypeptides, nucleic acids \n(DNA, siRNA), interferons, antibodies, anti-inflammatories, \nhormones, and chemotherapeutic agents.  In various other \nembodiments, the drug can be selected from amino acids, \nvaccines, antiviral agents, gene delivery vectors, interleukin \ninhibitors, immunomodulators, neurotropic factors, neuro \nprotective agents, antineoplastic agents, chemotherapeutic \nagents, polysaccharides, anti-coagulants (e.g., LMWH, pen \ntasaccharides), antibiotics (e.g., immunosuppressants), anal \ngesic agents, and vitamins. Examples of Suitable types of \nproteins include, glycoproteins, enzymes (e.g., proteolytic \nenzymes), hormones or other analogs (e.g., LHRH, steroids, \ncorticosteroids, growth factors), antibodies (e.g., anti-VEGF \nantibodies, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors), cytokines (e.g., \nCl-,  3-, or Y-interferons), interleukins (e.g., IL-2, IL-10), and \ndiabetes/obesity-related therapeutics (e.g., insulin, exenatide, \nPYY. GLP-1 and its analogs, rimonabant). In one embodi \nment, the drug is agonadotropin-releasing (LHRH) hormone \nanalog, Such as leuprolide. In another exemplary embodi \nment, the drug comprises parathyroid hormone, Such as a \nhuman parathyroid hormone or its analogs, e.g., hPTH(1-84) \nor hPTH(1-34). In a further embodiment, the drug is selected \nfrom nucleosides, nucleotides, and analogs and conjugates \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n6 \nthereof. In yet another embodiment, the drug comprises a \npeptide with natriuretic activity, such as atrial natriuretic pep \ntide (ANP),  B-type (or brain) natriuretic  peptide (BNP), \nC-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), or dendroaspis natriuretic \npeptide (DNP). In still  another embodiment, the drug is \nselected from diuretics, vasodilators, inotropic agents, anti \narrhythmic agents, Ca\" channel blocking agents, anti-adren \nergics/sympatholytics, and renin angiotensin System antago \nnists.  In one embodiment, the drug is a VEGF inhibitor. \nVEGF antibody, VEGF antibody fragment, or another anti \nangiogenic agent.  Examples include an aptamer. Such as \nMACUGENTM (Pfizer/Eyetech)  (pegaptainib  sodium))  or \nLUCENTISTM  (Genetech/Novartis)  (rhufab  VEGF,  or \nranibizumab), which could be used in the prevention of cho \nroidal neovascularization (useful in the treatment of age \nrelated macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy). In yet \na further embodiment, the drug is a prostaglandin, a prosta \ncyclin, or another drug effective in the treatment of peripheral \nvascular disease. In still another embodiment, the drug is an \nangiogenic agent, such as VEGF. In a further embodiment, \nthe drug is an anti-inflammatory Such as dexamethasone. In \none embodiment, a device includes both angiogenic agents \nand anti-inflammatory agents. A single device may include a \nsingle drug or a combination of two or more drugs. \n\nThe release of drug from the device may be tailored to \nprovide a temporally modulated release profile (e.g., pulsatile \nrelease) when time variation in plasma levels is desired or a \nmore continuous or consistent release profile when a constant \nplasma level as needed to enhance a therapeutic effect, for \nexample. Pulsatile release, or intermittent release, can be \nachieved from an individual dose unit, from a plurality of \ndose units, or a combination thereof. For example, where \neach dose unit provides only a single pulse, multiple pulses \n(i.e. pulsatile release) are achieved by temporally staggering \nthe single pulse release from each of several dose units. Alter \nnatively, multiple pulses can be achieved from a single dose \nunit by incorporating several layers of a release system and \nother materials into a single dose unit. Continuous release can \nbe achieved by incorporating a release system that degrades, \ndissolves, or allows diffusion of molecules through it over an \nextended period.  In  addition,  continuous  release  can be \napproximated by releasing several pulses of molecules in \nrapid succession. \n\nIn one embodiment, the drug formulation within a dose \nunit comprises layers of a drug or drugs and a non-drug \nmaterial, wherein the multiple layers provide pulsed drug \nrelease due to the intervening layers of non-drug. Such a \nstrategy can be used to obtain complex release profiles. \nDiscrete Timing and Seal Members \n\nDose units may be separated from each other by at least one \ntiming member or seal member, membrane, film, or other \nstructure. For example, a discrete timing member or seal \nmember may be disposed between each dose unit. The dis \ncrete timing member or seal member functions to protect the \ndose unit (e.g.,  the drug formulation) until Such time as \nrelease of the dose unit is desired. A discrete timing member \nor seal member may be a thin film or other structure suitable \nfor separating a dose unit from the environment outside of the \ndevice. The discrete timing members or seal members are \nformed from a material or mixture of materials  that are \ndegradable. As used herein, the term \u201cdegradable' refers to a \nmaterial that will biodegrade, bioerode, dissolve, or other \nwise rupture in contact with fluids and tissues in vivo. \n\nEach of the discrete timing members or seal members are \ndesigned to open at specified times, thereby delivering the \ndose unit sequentially at pre-specified times. These discrete \ntiming members or seal  members may be independently \n\n\fUS 8,679,093 B2 \n\n7 \ndegraded or groups of the discrete timing members or seal \nmembers may degrade Substantially  simultaneously.  For \nexample, in certain embodiments the discrete timing mem \nbers or seal members disposed at distal ends of the device are \nexposed to the environment outside of the device and degrade \nSubstantially simultaneously, Such that dose units are released \nsubstantially simultaneously from distal ends of the device. \nDesirably, the exposure of the dose unit to the environment is \npassively controlled through the rupture of the discrete timing \nmember or seal member. In a passive control system for \nexample, the timing can be controlled by selecting the dis \ncrete timing member or seal member dimension, composi \ntion, and structure. \n\nThe compositions of the discrete timing member or seal \nmember may be selected from materials that will rupture in \nresponse to an environment existing in vivo in the patientorin \nresponse to a component contained in the reservoir. Examples \nof environmental conditions include, but are not limited to \ntemperature, water, pH, an electrolyte, and enzymes. \n\nIn preferred embodiments, the discrete timing members or \nseal members are selected to degrade in vivo, without any \nintervention  by  the  patient  or caregiver  (Subsequent  to \ndeployment). In one particular embodiment, the discrete tim \ning members or seal members are formed of a biocompatible \npolymer, such as a poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), or \npoly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)S, as well as degradable poly(an \nhydride-co-imides), of a composition and thickness designed \nto  disintegrate by hydrolysis  in  a prescribed timeframe, \nreleasing the drug contained in the dose unit. For example, the \ndiscrete timing member or seal member may have a thickness \nranging from about 0.1 mm to about 1.0 mm, e.g., 0.2 mm to \n0.8 mm. \n\nIn a preferred embodiment, a discrete timing member or \nseal member completely separates the dose units from each \nother. In another embodiment, discrete timing members or \nseal members separate only a portion of the dose units from \neach other. \n\nRepresentative examples of discrete timing members or \nseal members include degradable polymeric and non-poly \nmeric materials. In a preferred embodiment, the discrete tim \ning members or seal members are formed of a bioerodible or \nbiodegradable material known in the art, such as a synthetic \npolymer or copolymer, e.g., a polyester (such as PLGA), a \npoly(anhydride), or a polycaprolactone. The discrete timing \nmembers or seal members may be a multilayer structure. For \nexample an inner layer may be porous or otherwise control \ndiffusion once the outer, non-permeable layer has disinte \ngrated. The discrete timing members or seal members of a \nsingle device may be made of different materials, may have \ndifferent thicknesses, may have different degrees of cross \nlinking, or a combination thereof, for the purpose of opening \ndifferent dose units at different times relative to one another. \nRegardless of their construction, the timing members gener \nally are designed to degrade before the housing units can \ndegrade, or at least before the housing units degrade suffi \nciently to lose structural integrity that would adversely affect \nthe sequentially controlled release of the doses of drug. \n\nExemplary Embodiments \n\nThe foregoing embodiments of devices and methods for \ntheir use can be further understood with reference to the \nappended drawings and description below, where like num \nbers refer to the same device or component. \n\nAn embodiment of a drug delivery device 100 illustrated in \nFIGS. 1A-1C has a plurality of housing units 110, each hous \ning unit 110 having an exterior surface 112 and an interior \n\n8 \nsurface 114. Fifteen housing units are shown in FIG. 1A, \nalthough other numbers are readily envisioned. The exterior \nsurfaces 112 of the connected housing units 110 define a \nsidewall. The housing units 110 are located between a first \nend piece 116 defining a first end of the device and a second \nend piece 118 defining a second end of the device distal to the \nfirst end of the device. Although not shown, the first and/or \nsecond end piece may have a tapered or point end to facilitate \ntissue penetration during the insertion/deployment process. \nA plurality of discrete dose units 120, each comprising at \nleast one drug, are disposed within the housing units 110 \nlocated between the first 116 and second end pieces 118. The \ndose unit may be a drug formulation which includes the at \nleast one drug. The device 110 further includes degradable \ntiming members 122 connected to the housing units 124 and \nseparating the discrete dose units 120 from one another. The \ntiming member 122, the first end piece 116 (or a second \ntiming member 122 or second end piece 118), and the interior \nsurface of the housing unit 114 to which the first end piece (or \na second timing member 122 or second end piece 118) is \nconnected together define a reservoir 124 in which one of the \ndose units 120 is disposed. It should be appreciated that for \nillustration purposes the dose units shown in FIGS. 1C and 1D \ndo not completely fill the reservoir 124. Each reservoir in \npreferred embodiments would be completely or at least sub \nstantially filled with the dose units so as to maximize the \namount of drug loaded in the device. \n\nThe device is adapted to release a first discrete dose unit \n120 following rupture of the first 116 or second end piece 118, \nand Subsequently to release a second discrete dose unit 120 \nfollowing rupture of a degradable timing member 122. The \ndevice subsequently releases one or more additional discrete \ndose units 120 following rupture of one or more additional \ndegradable timing members 122. A schematic illustration of \nthe timed release from a drug delivery device according to the \nforegoing embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 1D. \n\nIn one embodiment of the drug delivery device 110, one of \nthe housing units 110 has a flange 126 defining a shoulder \n129. An end 127 of the other of the housing units is mated with \nthe flange 126 and the shoulder 129 of the adjacent housing \nunit or end piece. The at least one timing member 122 may \ncomprise a flange 128 that is mated with the flange 126 of the \nhousing unit 110 and with the interior surface 114 of the \nhousing unit. The drug delivery device 100 optionally further \ncomprises a coating (e.g., a metalized film deposition or \npolymer) on the exterior surfaces 112 of the housing units 110 \nas shown in FIG. 5. \n\nThose skilled in the art will appreciate that the geometry \nand dimensions of the drug delivery device and its compo \nnents (i.e., housing unit, dose unit, degradable timing mem \nber, etc.) may be modified from the present description to \nsatisfy  various  design  needs.  Exemplary dimensions  of \ndevices are discussed below for FIGS. 3-4, with FIGS. 3A and \n4A illustrating the housing units and FIGS. 3B and 4B illus \ntrating degradable timing members of embodiments of the \ndrug delivery device. \n\nFor example, in an exemplary embodiment the housing \nunit 310 illustrated in FIG.3A has a length in the longitudinal \ndirection of approximately 0.040 inches, an exterior surface \n312 diameter of approximately 0.040 inches, an interior sur \nface 314 diameter (X) of approximately 0.030 inches, a flange \n326 having a length of approximately 0.003 inches, a shoul \nder 329 having a length of approximately 0.004 inches, and an \nend 327 having a length of approximately 0.003 inches for \nmating with the flange 326 and shoulder 329 of the adjacent \nhousing unit. In an embodiment, the relative interior Surface \nand exterior Surface diameters of the housing units at the end \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n\fUS 8,679,093 B2 \n\n327 and flange 326 of the housing units, respectively, are such \nthat the flange 326 of a first housing unit snugly fits within the \nend 327 of an adjacent second housing unit (illustrated in \nFIG. 5). For example, in an embodiment the housing unit 310 \nof FIG. 3A may have an interior surface diameter at the end \n327 of 0.0365 inches and an exterior surface 312 diameter at \nthe flange 326 of 0.0370 inches, such that the diameter of the \nflange-side of the housing unit would be compressed when \nmated with the adjacent housing unit. Alternatively, the hous \ning unit 310 of FIG.3A may have an interior surface diameter \nat the end 327 of 0.037 inches and an exterior surface diam \neter at the flange 326 of 0.0365 inches, such that the diameter \nof the flange-side of the housing unit would readily mate with \nthe end-side of the adjacent housing unit without being com \npressed. In embodiments, the degradable timing member 322 \nillustrated in FIG. 3B has an outer diameter of approximately \n0.0335 inches and a width in the longitudinal direction of \napproximately 0.010 inches. The degradable timing member \nillustrated in FIG. 3B is  disposed within the overlapping \nflange 326 and shoulder 329 of adjacent housing units 310 \nillustrated in FIG. 3A and may have a feature that interlocks \nwith a portion of the housing units 310 to improve the isola \ntion of the adjacent reservoirs (FIG. 5). In certain embodi \nments, other means may be used to secure adjacent housing \nunits. For example, laser welds may be used to join circum \nferential seams of the housing units, a metalized film or other \ncoating  may be applied  to  the  exterior  Surface  of the \nassembled housing units, or adhesives may be used to secure \nadjacent housing units and degradable timing members. \n\nThe housing unit 410 and degradable timing member 422 \nillustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B, respectively, are similar to \nthose illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B; however, they exclude \nthe interlocking feature of the housing units and degradable \ntiming members. \n\nAnother exemplary embodiment of a drug delivery device \nis illustrated in FIG. 6. The device 200 comprises a plurality \nof solid units 210 of a drug formulation which comprises at \nleast one drug. The solid units 210 each have a proximal end \n212, a distal end 214, and one or more longitudinal exterior \nsurfaces 216 therebetween. At least one seal member 218 is \nsandwiched between the proximal end 212 of a first solid unit \n210 and the distal end 214 of a second solid unit 210. A \ncoating layer 220 covers at least the longitudinal exterior \nsurfaces 216 of the solid units 210. Desirably, the coating \nlayer 220 is substantially non-permeable such that release of \nthe drug from the solid units 210 is controlled at least in part \nby the in  vivo disintegration of the seal member 218. In \nparticular embodiments, the solid units 210 each have a cylin \ndrically shaped exterior surface 216 and the seal member 218 \nis disk shaped. \nMaking the Devices \n\nThe basic methods of fabricating and assembling the drug \ndelivery devices described herein are known or can be readily \nadapted from techniques known in the art. In one embodi \nment, the housing units, timing membranes, and seal mem \nbers are made by casting or molding, such as by injection \nmolding. Micromachining and drilling processes may also be \nused in the product of the components. The components can \nbe assembled and secured together using a variety of tech \nniques including, but not limited to, the use of adhesives, heat \nor solvent welding, and/or mechanical fasteners.  In  one \nembodiment, two or more components may joined together \nusing laser welding. \nImplanting/Using the Devices \n\nThe devices described herein can be used in a variety of \ntherapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic medical applications. \nIn a preferred embodiment, the devices store and release an \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n10 \neffective amount of at least one drug formulation over an \nextended period, e.g., between 1 week and 12 months. \n\nThe device may be implanted into a patient (Such as a \nhuman or other vertebrate animal) using standard Surgical or \nmore preferably a minimally invasive implantation tech \nnique, (e.g., by a small incision or injection through a needle, \ntrocar, cannula, catheter, or the like) or noninvasive implan \ntation technique (e.g., Swallowing). Ultrasound, nuclear mag \nnetic resonance, virtual anatomic positioning systems, or \nother imaging techniques may be employed to confirm proper \npositioning of the implant.  In  various embodiments, the \nadministration system may include a catheter, wire, tube, \nendoscope, or other mechanism capable of reaching the \ndesired recipientanatomic site through an incision, puncture, \ntrocar, or through an anatomic passageway Such as a vessel, \norifice, or organ lumen, or trans-abdominally or trans-tho \nracically. In various embodiments according to the present \ninvention, the delivery system may be steerable by the opera \ntOr. \n\nIn one embodiment, the device may be dimensioned for \ndelivery from a 6 to 26 gauge (approximately 0.439 inches to \n0.241 inches nominal ID) needle. Larger or Smaller gauges of \nmodified needles may also be used to accommodate various \nsized drug delivery devices described herein. It may be pref \nerable to implant devices that have larger diameters using \nmeans known in the art other than needles. In certain embodi \nments the drug delivery device may be inserted through a \nSmall incision, wherein the incision length is approximately \nequal to the diameter of the device. In certain embodiments, \nthe drug delivery device described herein may be delivered \nusing apparatus and techniques described, for example, in \nU.S. Pat. No. 7,214,206 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,104,945, which \nare incorporated herein by reference. \n\nDrug may then be passively released locally at the tissue \nsite of implantation using a preselected delivery profile (e.g., \ndosing schedule) based on the design of the particular device \nas prescribed by the patient\u2019s physician. For example, in \nembodiments the drug is released in a controlled and Sus \ntained manner to provide a desired local or systemic physi \nological or pharmacological effect over a desired time period \n(e.g.,  one weeks to  12 months). Alternatively, in  certain \nembodiments the drug is released in a pulsatile manner to \nprovide the desired local or systemic physiological or phar \nmacological effect over the desired time period. \n\nModifications and variations of the methods and devices \ndescribed herein will be obvious to those skilled in the art \nfrom the foregoing detailed description.

No. 1 1/650,227, filed Jan. 5, 2007, the disclosure \nof which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. \n\n10 \n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\nThe present invention relates to formulations for oral trans \nmucosal drug delivery and methods for delivery of medica \ntions across the oral mucosa using drug dosage forms com \nprising Such formulations and methods for using the same. \n\n15 \n\nBACKGROUND OF THE TECHNOLOGY \n\nOral dosage forms account for approximately eighty per \ncent of all the drug dosage forms on the market. Oral dosage \nforms are non-invasive, easily administered and have high \npatient compliance. \n\nOrally administered therapeutic agents are rapidly trans \nported to the stomach and Small intestine for absorption \nacross the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal membranes into the \nblood. The efficiency of absorption of a drug following oral \nadministration can be low because of metabolism within the \nGI tract and first-pass metabolism within the liver resulting in \nrelatively lengthy onset times or erratic absorption character \nistics that are not well suited to control acute disorders. The \nmajority of oral dosage forms on the market are designed for \nGI delivery. Relatively few oral dosage forms are designed for \ndelivery through the oral mucosa. \n\nHowever, oral transmucosal delivery offers a number of \nadvantages in that it can provide a shorter onset time and more \nconsistent time (T,) to  maximal plasma concentration \n(C) than oral delivery, in particular for lipophilic drugs. \nThis is because the drug rapidly passes directly and efficiently \nthrough the epithelium of the highly vascularized mucosal \ntissue to the plasma, thus rapidly reaching the circulation \nwhile avoiding the slower, often inefficient and variable GI \nuptake. In addition, due to the avoidance of the first-pass \nmetabolism and avoidance of inefficient  drug absorption \nthrough the gut, Sublingual drug uptake may improve drug \nbioavailability. It is therefore advantageous for a drug to be \ndelivered through the mucus membranes of the oral cavity, \n(e.g., via the Sublingual route), when rapid onset, consistent \nT, and C. are advantageous. \n\nIn carrying out oral transmucosal drug delivery, the drug is \nabsorbed through the epithelial membranes of the oral cavity. \nHowever, frequently the key risk associated with oral trans \nmucosal delivery is the enhanced potential for Swallowing the \nmedication owing to the continuous generation, backward \nflow and swallowing of the saliva. This becomes a particular \nrisk when the used dosage forms are large, thereby producing \nincreased saliva response, which, in turn, leads to increased \nSwallowing and removal of the dosage form from the oral \nmucosa. The present invention provides the advantage that \nthe formulations have bioadhesive properties which facilitate \nadherence to the oral mucosa during administration, thus \nminimizing the risk of ingestion and inefficient delivery \npotential. \n\nVarious Solid dosage forms, such as Sublingual tablets, \ntroches, lozenges, lozenges-on-a-stick, chewing gums, and \nbuccal patches, have been used to deliver drugs via the oral \nmucosal tissue. Solid dosage forms such as lozenges and \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n2 \ntablets are commonly used for oral transmucosal delivery of \ndrugs, e.g., nitroglycerin Sublingual tablets. \n\nRelevant formulations and delivery systems for oral or \nbuccal administration of pain medication have been previ \nously disclosed, for example, in: U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,698,822; \n3,972,995;  3,870,790:  3,444,858;  3,632,743;  4,020,558: \n4,229,447; 4,671,953; 4,836,737; and 5,785,989. \n\nU.S. Patent Publication No. 2002016.0043 discloses com \npositions and methods of manufacture for dissolvable and \nnon-dissolvable drug-containing dosage-forms for noninva \nsive administration of medications through mucosal tissues \nof the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus of a patient. \n\nU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,671,953 and 5,785,989 (Stanley, et al.) \ndisclose a lozenge-on-a-stick dosage form for transmucosal \ndrug delivery. Once the appropriate amount of drug is deliv \nered, the patient or caregiver can remove the lozenge, thus, \nstopping the drug delivery to prevent overdose. \n\nU.S. Pat.

No. 6,159,498 \n(Tapolsky,  et  al.),  and  U.S.  Patent  Publication  Nos. \n20030194420 and 200500 13845 disclose a water soluble, \nbiodegradable drug delivery device, e.g., a bilayer film disk \nhaving an adhesive layer and a backing layer, both water \nsoluble, which adheres to mucosal Surfaces. \n\nU.S. Pat.  No.  6.252,981  (Zhang et al.)  discloses oral \nmucosal drug delivery as an alternative method of systemic \ndrug delivery formulation and method for oral transmucosal \ndelivery of a pharmaceutical. The invention provides a drug \nformulation comprising a solid pharmaceutical agent in Solid \nSolution with a dissolution agent in Solid form, yielding a \nsolid solution. The formulation can be used with a variety of \noral transmucosal delivery dosage forms, such as a tablet, \nlozenge, lozenge on a stick, chewing gum, and buccal or \nmucosal patch. See, also Zhang et al., Clin Pharmacokinet. \n2002:41 (9):661-80. \n\nAlthough various oral mucosal drug delivery systems have \nbeen described, there remains a need for improved formula \ntions for use in an oral transmucosal dosage form that allows \nfor sustained drug delivery of the dosage form, and the ability \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n3 \nto manipulate and control the drug dissolution kinetics. The \npresent invention addresses this problem. \n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\nThe present invention provides compositions and methods \ncomprising drug dosage forms comprising a formulation of \nthe invention, as described in detail herein below. \n\nIn one embodiment, the invention provides a bioadhesive \ndrug formulation for oral transmucosal administration to a \nSubject, which comprises a non-ordered mixture of a prede \ntermined amount of a pharmaceutically active agent and a \nbioadhesive material, where the bioadhesive material pro \nvides for adherence to the oral mucosa of the subject. \n\nIn another embodiment, the invention provides a bioadhe \nsive drug formulation for oral transmucosal administration to \na Subject, which comprises a predetermined amount of a \npharmaceutically active agent and a bioadhesive material, \nwhere dissolution of the drug formulation is independent of \npH. \n\nThe formulation may have one or more of the following \ncharacteristics: the formulation may further comprise Stearic \nacid;

The invention is not limited to the \nspecific formulations and methodology or medical conditions \ndescribed herein, as Such may, of course, vary. It is also to be \nunderstood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose \nof describing  particular  embodiments  only,  and  is  not \nintended to limit the scope of the present invention. \n\nIt must be noted that as used herein and in the appended \nclaims, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, and \u201cthe  include plural \nreferences unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, \nfor example, reference to \u201ca drug formulation  includes a \nplurality of such formulations and reference to \u201ca drug deliv \nery device' includes systems comprising drug formulations \nand devices for containment, storage and delivery of Such \nformulations. \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n6 \nUnless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms \nused herein have the same meaning as commonly understood \nto one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention \nbelongs. Although any methods, devices and materials simi \nlar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the \npractice or testing of the invention, the preferred methods, \ndevices and materials are now described. \n\nI. Definitions \n\nThe term \u201cformulation\u201d or \u201cdrug formulation' or \u201cdosage \nform  as used herein refers to a composition containing at \nleast one therapeutic agent or medication for delivery to a \nSubject. The dosage form comprises a given \u201cformulation\u201d or \n'drug formulation' and may be administered to a patient in \nthe form of a lozenge, pill, tablet, capsule, membrane, strip, \nliquid, patch, film, gel, spray or other form. \n\nThe  terms  \u201cdrug\u201d,  \u201cmedication\u201d,  \u201cpharmacologically \nactive agent\u201d and the like are used interchangeably herein and \ngenerally refer to any Substance that alters the physiology of \nan animal. A dosage from comprising a formulation of the \ninvention may be used to deliver any drug that may be admin \nistered by the oral transmucosal route. The term \u201cdrug  as \nused herein with reference to a formulation of the invention \nmeans any \"drug\u201d, \u201cactive agent\u201d, \u201cactive'. \u201cmedication\u201d or \n\u201ctherapeutically active agent\u201d that can be effectively admin \nistered by the oral transmucosal route. \n\nThe term \"drug\u201d as applied to analgesia includes Sufentanil \nor a Sufentanil congener, Such as alfentanil, fentanyl, lofen \ntanil, carfentanil, remifentanil, trefentanil, or mirfentanil, as \nwell as formulations comprising one or more therapeutic \ncompounds. Use of \u201cdrug  or the phrase \"sufentanil or a \ncongener  is not meant to be limiting to use of, or formula \ntions comprising, only one of these selected opioid com \npounds. Furthermore, reference to Sufentanil alone or to a \nselected Sufentanil congener alone, e.g., reference to \u201cfenta \nnyl', is understood to be only exemplary of the drugs suitable \nfor delivery according to the methods of the invention, and is \nnot meant to be limiting in any way. \n\nThe term \u201cdrug  may be used interchangeably herein with \nthe term \u201ctherapeutic agent' or \u201cmedication'. It  will be \nunderstood that a \u201cdrug  formulation of the invention may \ninclude more than one therapeutic agent, wherein exemplary \ncombinations of therapeutic agents include a combination of \ntwo or more opioid analogues, such as Sufentanil plus an \nopioid such as fentanyl, alfentanil, lofentanil, carfentanil, \nremifentanil, trefentanil, or mirfentanil, or any other drug that \nmight be administered in combination. \n\nThe term \u201cactive agent' or \u201cactive' may be used inter \nchangeably herein with the term \u201cdrug  and is used herein to \nrefer to any therapeutically active agent. \n\nThe term \u201ccongener\u201d as used herein refers to one of many \nvariants or configurations of a common chemical structure. \n\nThe term 'subject' includes any Subject, generally a mam \nmal (e.g., human, canine, feline, equine, bovine, ungulate \netc.), in which treatment for a disorder, such as management \nof pain oranesthetization, is desired. \n\nThe term \u201cmucosal membrane' refers generally to any of \nthe mucus-coated biological membranes in the body. Absorp \ntion through the mucosal membranes of the oral cavity is of \nparticular interest. Thus, buccal, Sublingual, gingival and \npalatal  absorption  are  specifically  contemplated  by  the \npresent invention. In a preferred embodiment, the penetration \nenhancers of the present invention are used to  improve \nabsorption through those oral tissues which most resemble \nthe skin in their cellular structure, i.e. the gingiva and palate. \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n7 \nThe term \u201ctransmucosal  delivery of a drug and the like is \nmeant to encompass all forms of delivery across or through a \nmucosal membrane. In particular, \"oral transmucosal  deliv \nery of a drug includes delivery across any tissue of the mouth, \npharynx, larynx, trachea, or upper gastrointestinal tract, par \nticularly  including  the  Sublingual,  gingival  and  palatal \nmucosal tissues. \n\nThe terms \"oral dosage form\u201d, \u201coral transmucosal dosage \nform' and \u201cdissolvable dosage form' may be used inter \nchangeably herein and refer to a dosage form for use in \npracticing the present invention, which comprises a drug \nformulation as described herein. The oral dosage form is \ntypically a 'sublingual dosage form', but in some cases other \noral transmucosal routes may be employed. The invention \nrelies upon Such oral dosage forms to provide Sustained deliv \nery of drugs across the oral mucosa; by controlling the for \nmulation  design  immediate,  intermediate  and  Sustained \nrelease of drugs can be achieved, as described below. The \ndosage form is a Substantially homogeneous composition \nwhich comprises active ingredients and one or more of \nmucoadhesives (also referred to herein as \u201cbioadhesives') \nthat provide for adherence to the mucosa of the mouth of a \npatient, binders for binding the excipients in a single tablet, \none or more hydrogel-forming excipients, one or more bulk \ning agents, one or more lubricants, as well as other excipients \nand factors that affect dissolution time or drug stability. The \ndissolvable drug formulations of the invention are neither \neffervescent nor do they comprise an essentially water-free, \nordered mixture of microparticles of drug adhered to the \nsurface of carrier particles, where the carrier particles are \nSubstantially larger than the microparticles of drug. In one \naspect, the present invention provides small-volume oral \ntransmucosal drug delivery dosage forms. \n\nThe term \u201cnon-ordered particulate mixture' or \u201cnon-or \ndered mixture' is used herein with reference to a formulation \nof the invention where the mixture is not ordered with respect \nto the pharmaceutically active agent and the bioadhesive \nmaterial or bioadhesion promoting agent, or other formula \ntion components. In addition, the term is used herein with \nreference to any formulation prepared by a process that \ninvolves dry mixing wherein drug particles are not uniformly \ndistributed over the surface of larger carrier particles. Such \nnon-ordered mixing may involve dry mixing of particles in \na non-ordered fashion, where there is no requirement with \nrespect to the order of addition/mixing of specific excipients \nwith the drug, bioadhesive material or bioadhesion promoting \nagent and/or disintegrants. Further in the non-ordered mixing \nprocess, there is no limitation on the size of the drug particles. \nThe drug particles may be larger than 25 um. In addition, a \n\u201cnon-ordered mixture' includes any mixing processes in \nwhich the primary carrier particles do not incorporate a dis \nintegrant within. Finally the \u201cnon-ordered mixture' may be \nprepared by any  wet mixing  processes, i.e. processes in \nwhich a solvent or non-solvent is added during the mixing \nprocess or any mixing process in which the drug is added in a \nSolution or Suspension form. \n\nThe term \"oral transmucosal drug delivery\u201d as used herein \nrefers to delivery substantially via the oral transmucosal route \nand not via swallowing followed by GI absorption. This \nincludes delivery via the buccal, Sublingual or gum transmu \ncosal areas. The formulations of the current invention are \ndesigned to provide for a drug dissolution rate that allows for \nmaximal delivery via the oral mucosa, and also provides \nSustained delivery rates across the oral mucosa via placement \nof the dosage form within transmucosal cavity. \n\nAs used herein, \u201csublingual, means literally \u201cunder the \ntongue\u2019 and refers to a method of administering Substances \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n8 \nvia the mouth in Such a way that the Substances are rapidly \nabsorbed via the blood vessels under the tongue rather than \nvia the digestive tract. Among the various transmucosal sites, \nthe mucosa of the sublingual cavity is found to be the most \nconvenient and easily accessible site for the delivery of thera \npeutic agents for both local and systemic delivery as Sustained \nrelease dosage forms because it of its abundant vasculariza \ntion. Direct access to the systemic circulation through the \ninternal jugular vein bypasses the hepatic first pass metabo \nlism leading to high bioavailability. Further, owing to the \nhighly vascularized nature of the Sublingual mucosal mem \nbrane and the reduced number of epithelial cell layers com \npared to other mucosal membranes, absorption of therapeutic \nSubstances occurs rapidly, thus allowing for direct access to \nthe systemic circulation and thus enable quick onset of action \nwhile avoiding complications of oral administration. \n\nAs used herein, the term \"hydrogel-forming preparation'. \nmeans a Solid formulation largely devoid of water which upon \ncontact with bodily fluids, and in particular those in the oral \nmucosa, is capable of absorbing water in Such a way that it \nforms a hydrated gel in situ. The formation of the gel follows \nunique disintegration (or erosion) kinetics with Sustained \nrelease of the drug over time, which occurs primarily by \ndiffusion. Additionally, the term \u201chydrogel-forming prepara \ntion  describes a solid formulation largely devoid of water \nwhich upon contact with bodily fluids, and in particular those \nin the oral cavity, transforms into a film that releases the drug. \nSuch films increase the surface area available for drug release \nand absorption thus enabling faster absorption of the drug. \n\nThe term \u201cdisintegration' is used interchangeably herein \nwith the term \u201cerosion' and means the physical process by \nwhich a tablet breaks down and pertains to the physical integ \nrity of the tablet alone. This can occur in a number of different \nways including breaking into Smaller pieces and ultimately, \nfine and large particulates or, alternatively, eroding from the \noutside in until the tablet has disappeared. \n\nThe term \u201cdissolution\u201d as used herein means the process by \nwhich the active ingredient is dissolved from the tablet in the \npresence of a solvent, in vitro, or physiological fluids in Vivo, \ne.g., Saliva, irrespective of the mechanism of release, diffu \nSion, erosion or combined erosion and diffusion. \n\nThe term \u201cbioadhesion\u201d as used herein refers to the process \nof adhesion of the dosage forms to a biological Surface more \nin general, including mucosal membranes. \n\nThe expression \u201cmucoadhesion' is used herein to refer to \nadhesion  to  mucosal  membranes which are covered by \nmucus, Such as those in the oral cavity and is used inter \nchangeably herein with the term \u201cbioadhesion\u201d which refers \nto adhesion to any biological Surface. \n\nThe term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u2019 means an \namount of a therapeutic agent, or a rate of delivery of a \ntherapeutic agent (e.g., amount over time), effective to facili \ntate a desired therapeutic effect, such as pain relief. The \nprecise desired therapeutic effect (e.g., the degree of pain \nrelief, and source of the pain relieved, etc.) will vary accord \ning to the condition to be treated, the tolerance of the subject, \nthe drug and/or drug formulation to be administered (e.g., the \npotency of the therapeutic agent (drug), the concentration of \ndrug in the formulation, and the like), and a variety of other \nfactors that are appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the \nart. \n\n\u201cControlled drug delivery\u201d refers to release or administra \ntion of a drug from a given dosage formina controlled fashion \nin order to achieve the desired pharmacokinetic profile in \nvivo. An aspect of \u201ccontrolled  drug delivery is the ability to \nmanipulate the formulation and/or dosage form in order to \nestablish the desired kinetics of drug release. \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n\u201cSustained drug delivery\u201d refers to release or administra \ntion of a drug from a given dosage formina Sustained fashion \nin order to achieve the desired pharmacokinetic profile in \nvivo. \n\nThe term \u201cT\u201d as used herein means the time point of \n\nmaximum observed plasma concentration. \n\nThe term \u201cC.\u201d as used herein  means the maximum \n\nobserved plasma concentration. \n\nThe term \u201cAUC\u201d as used herein means \u201carea under the \ncurve' in a plot of concentration of drug in plasma versus \ntime. AUC is usually given for the time interval Zero to infin \nity, however, clearly plasma drug concentrations cannot be \nmeasured  to  infinity  for  a  patient  so  mathematical \napproaches are used to estimate the AUC from a limited \nnumber of concentration measurements. In a practical sense, \nthe AUC (from Zero to infinity) represents the total amount of \ndrug absorbed by the body, irrespective of the rate of absorp \ntion. This is useful when trying to determine whether two \nformulations of the same dose release the same dose of drug \nto the body. The AUC of a transmucosal dosage form com \npared to that of the same dosage administered intravenously \nserves as the basis for a measurement of bioavailability. \n\nThe term \u201cF\u201d as used herein means \u201cpercent bioavailabil \nity' and represents the fraction of drug absorbed from the test \narticle as compared to the same drug when administered \nintravenously. It  is calculated from the AUC  of the test \narticle following delivery from the intended route versus the \nAUC for the same drug after intravenous administration. It is \ncalculated from the equation: F (%)=AUC  (test article)/ \nAUC  (intravenous route/article). This is an important term \nthat establishes the relative fraction of the drug absorbed via \nthe  test  route (or article)  versus  the  maximum possible \namount absorbed via the intravenous route. \n\nThe term \u201cT\u201d as used herein means the observed \u201ctime \nof onset' and represents the time required for the plasma drug \nconcentration to reach 50% of the maximum observed plasma \nconcentration, C. \n\nThe term \u201cTherapeutic Time Ratio\u201d or \u201cTTR  represents \nthe average time that the drug is present at therapeutic levels, \ndefined as time within which the drug plasma concentration is \nnormalized by the drug's \nmaintained above 50% of C, \nelimination half-life and it is calculated by the formula: TTR= \n(Time above 50% of C)/(Terminal intravenous elimina \ntion half-life of the drug). The last term is obtained from \nliterature data for the drug of interest in the appropriate spe \ncies. \n\nAs used herein, when a drug formulation is said to \u201cadhere' \nto a surface. Such as a mucosal membrane, it is meant that the \nformulation is in contact with said Surface and is retained on \nthe surface without the application of an external force. Adhe \nsion is not meant to imply any particular degree of sticking or \nbonding, nor is it meant to imply any degree of permanency. \nThe term \u201cnon-occlusive' is used herein in its broadest \nsense to refer to not trapping or closing the skin to the atmo \nsphereby means of a patch device, fixed reservoir, application \nchamber, tape, bandage, Sticking plaster, or the like which \nremains on the skin at the site of application for a prolonged \nlength of time. \n\nThe term \u201cLog P as used herein means logarithm of the \nratio  of concentrations of un-ionized compound between \noctanol and water. It is also called the \"octanol-water partition \ncoefficient' and serves as a means to identify a chemical \ncharacteristic of a given drug. \n\nII.

In one pre \nferred embodiment, the dosage from is a solid that transforms \ninto a hydrogel following contact with saliva.  In another \npreferred embodiment, the dosage form is a Solid that trans \nforms into a bioadhesive film upon contact with saliva. \n\nExcipients include substances added to the formulations of \nthe invention which are required to produce a quality product, \ninclude, but are not limited to: bulking agents, binders, Sur \nfactants, bioadhesives, lubricants, disintegrants, stabilizers, \nsolubilizers, glidants, and additives or factors that affect dis \nSolution or disintegration time. \n\nExcipients are not limited to those above. Other suitable \nnontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for use in oral \nformulations can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical \nSciences, 17th Edition, 1985. \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n11 \nThe formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal \ndrug delivery include at least one bioadhesive (mucoadhe \nsive) agent or a mixture of bioadhesives to promote adhesion \nto the oral mucosa during drug delivery. In addition, the \nbioadhesive agents may also be effective in controlling the \ndosage form erosion time and/or, the drug dissolution kinetics \nover time when the dosage form is wetted by saliva. In addi \ntion, Some of the mucoadhesives named in this invention may \nalso serve as binders in the formulation to provide necessary \nbonding to the dosage form. \n\nExemplary mucoadhesive or bioadhesive materials, are \nselected from the group consisting of natural, synthetic or \nbiological polymers, lipids,  phospholipids,  and the like. \nExamples of natural and/or synthetic polymers include cel \nlulosic derivatives (such as methylcellulose, carboxymethyl \ncellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxyethylmethyl cellu \nlose, microcrystalline cellulose, etc), natural gums (such as \nguar gum, Xanthan gum, locust bean gum, karayagum, Vee \ngum etc), polyacrylates (such as Carbopol, polycarbophil. \netc), alginates, thiol-containing polymers, polyoxyethylenes, \npolyethylene glycols (PEG) of all molecular weights (prefer \nably between 1000 and 40,000 Da, of any chemistry, linear or \nbranched), dextrans of all  molecular weights (preferably \nbetween 1000 and 40,000 Da of any source), block copoly \nmers, such as those prepared by combinations of lactic & \nglycolic acid (PLA, PGA, PLGA of various  viscosities, \nmolecular weights and lactic-to-glycolic acid ratios) polyeth \nylene glycol-polypropylene glycol block copolymers of any \nnumber and combination of repeating units (such as Pluron \nics, Tektronix or Genapol block copolymers), combination of \nthe above copolymers either physically or chemically linked \nunits (for example PEG-PLA or PEG-PLGA copolymers) \nmixtures.  Preferably the bioadhesive material is  selected \nfrom the group of polyethylene glycols, polyoxyethylenes, \npolyacrylic acid polymers, such as Carbopols (such as Car \nbopol 71G, 934P. 971 P974P) and polycarbophils (such as \nNoveon AA-1, Noveon CA-1, Noveon CA-2), cellulose and \nits derivatives and most preferably it is polyethylene glycol, \nCarbopol, and/or a cellulosic derivative or a combination \nthereof. \n\nThe  mucoadhesive/bioadhesive  excipient  is  typically \npresent at 1-50% w/w, preferably 1-40% w/w or most pref \nerably between 2-30% w/w. A formulation of the invention \nmay contain one or more different bioadhesives in any com \nbination. \n\nThe formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal \ndrug delivery also include a binder or mixture of two or more \nbinders which facilitate binding of the excipients into a single \ndosage form. Exemplary binders are selected from the group \nconsisting of cellulosic derivatives (such as methylcellulose, \ncarboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxy \nethylmethyl cellulose, etc), polyacrylates (such as Carbopol, \npolycarbophil, etc),  Povidone (all grades), Polyox of any \nmolecular weight or grade, irradiated or not, starch, polyvi \nnylpyrrolidone (PVP), Avicel, and the like. \n\nThe binder is typically present at 0.5-60% w/w, preferably \n\n1-30% w/w and most preferably 1.5-15% w/w. \n\nIn one embodiment, the formulations of the invention for \noral transmucosal drug delivery also include at least one \nhydrogel-forming excipient.  Exemplary hydrogel-forming \nexcipients are selected from the group consisting of polyeth \nylene glycols and other polymers having an ethylene glycol \nbackbone,  whether  homopolymers  or  cross-linked  het \neropolymers, block copolymers of ethylene glycol units, such \nas polyethylene oxide homopolymers (such as Polyox N10/ \nMW=100,0001  Polyox-80/MW=200,000;  Polyox  1105/ \nMW=900,000;  Polyox-301/MW=4,000,000;  Polyox-303/ \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n12 \nMW=7,000,000, Polyox WSR-N-60K, all  of which are \ntradenames of Union Carbide), hydroxypropylmethylcelly \nlose (HPMC) of all molecular weights and grades, Poloxam \ners (such as Lutrol F-68, Lutrol F-127, F-105 etc, all trade \nnames of BASF Chemicals), Genapol, polyethylene glycols \n(PEG, such as PEG-1500, PEG-3500, PEG-4000, PEG-6000, \nPEG-8000, PEG-12000, PEG-20,000, etc.),  natural gums \n(Xanthan gum, Locust bean gum, etc) and cellulose deriva \ntives (HC, HMC, HMPC, HPC, CP, CMC), polyacrylic acid \nbased polymers either as free or cross-linked and combina \ntions thereof, biodegradable polymers such as poly lactic \nacids,  polyglycolic  acids  and any  combination  thereof, \nwhether a physical blend or cross-linked. In an embodiment, \nthe hydrogel components may be cross-linked. The hydrogel \nforming excipient(s) are typically present at 0.1-70% w/w, \npreferably 1-50% w/w or most preferably 1-30% w/w. \n\nThe formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal \ndrug delivery may also include at least one Sustained release \nmodifier which is a substance that upon hydration of the \ndosage form will preferentially interact with the drug in a \nphysical or molecular level and thus reduce the rate of its \ndiffusion from the transmucosal dosage form. Such excipi \nents may also reduce the rate of water uptake by the formu \nlation and thus enable a more prolonged drug dissolution and \nrelease from the tablet. In one embodiment, such sustained \nrelease modifiers are capable of binding molecularly to the \nactive via physical (and therefore reversible) interactions, \nthus increasing the effective molecular weight of the active \nand thus further modifying their permeation (diffusion) char \nacteristics through the epithelial and basal membranes of the \nsublingual mucosa. Such binding is reversible in nature and \ndoes not involve any chemical modifications of the active, \nthus it does not affect in any way its pharmacological action. \nIn another preferred embodiment, such Sustained release \nmodifiers upon hydration may form discrete structures that \nmay spontaneously entrap the drug and thus further prolong \nits action. Exemplary Sustained release modifiers are selected \nfrom the group consisting of lipids, phospholipids, Sterols, \nSurfactants,  polymers and salts.  In  general, the selected \nexcipient(s) are lipophilic and capable of naturally form com \nplexes with hydrophobic or lipophilic drugs. The degree of \nassociation of the release modifier(s) and the drug can be \nvaried by altering the modifier-to-drug ratio in the formula \ntion.  In  addition,  Such  interaction  may be appropriately \nenhanced by the appropriate combination of the release modi \nfier with the active drug in the manufacturing process. Alter \nnatively, the Sustained release modifier may be a charged \npolymer either synthetic or biopolymer bearing a net charge, \neither positive or negative, and which is capable of binding to \nthe active via electrostatic interactions thus modifying both \nits diffusion through the tablet and/or the kinetics of its per \nmeation through the mucosal surface. Similarly to the other \ncompounds mentioned above, such interaction is reversible \nand does not involve permanent chemical bonds with the \nactive. \n\nA Sustained release modifier may typically be present at \n0-80% w/w, preferably 1-20% w/w, most preferably 1-10% \nwfw. \n\nSuch Sustained release modifiers may further create pock \nets or microdomains dispersed throughout the Swollen net \nwork of the hydrogel. These pockets can serve as reservoirs \nfor drug compounds, as they will tend to decrease the driving \nforce for diffusion by reducing the concentration of the drug \nsolute in the bulk of the hydrogel. The hydrogel matrix along \nwith the sustained release modifiers may be selected and \ndesigned such that  drug release from the microdomains \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n13 \noccurs slowly enough to enable the Sustained dissolution of \nthe drug from the dosage form. \n\nThe formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal \ndrug delivery also include at least one filler (bulking agent). \nExemplary bulking agents are selected from the group con \nsisting of lactose USP, Starch 1500, mannitol, sorbitol, mal \ntodextrin, malitol or other non-reducing Sugars; microcrys \ntalline cellulose (e.g., Avicel), dibasic calcium phosphate \n(anhydrous or dihydrate). Sucrose, etc. and mixtures thereof. \nThe filler/bulking agent is typically present at 20-95% w/w, \npreferably 40-80% w/w. \n\nThe formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal \ndrug delivery may also include at least  one solubilizing \nagent(s). Such agents are beneficial to improve the solubility \nof the active drug and enhance its absorption characteristics, \nbut also facilitate handling and manufacturing. Appropriate \nsolubilizers may include cyclodextrins, pH adjusters, salts \nand buffers, Surfactants, fatty acids, phospholipids, metals of \nfatty acids etc. Exemplary surfactants are selected from the \ngroup consisting of ionic (Sodium lauryl Sulfate, etc), non \nionic Such as polysorbates (Tween and Span Surfactant series, \nPoloxamers, etc.), bile salts (such as Sodium taurocholate, \nSodium taurodeoxycholate, sodium starch glycolate, sodium \nglycodeoxycholate, sodium glycocholate, etc), various alkyl \nglycosides, fatty acids, phosphatidylcholines, triglycerides, \nsphingolipids, glycosylated lipids, PEGylated lipids and mix \ntures thereof and may be present at 0.01-5% w/w. Exemplary \nmetal salts and buffers may include at least of either organic \n(acetate, citrate, tartrate, etc) or inorganic (phosphate, car \nbonate, bicarbonate, borate, sulfate, sulfite, bisulfite,  met \nabisulfite,  chloride, etc.) salts of metals such as Sodium, \npotassium, calcium, magnesium, etc), Further, combinations \nof one or more of Such salts may be used to ensure adequate \nstabilization of the drug in the dosage form and may be \npresent  in  the  formulation  at  0.1-20%  w/w, preferably \nbetween 1-10% w/w. Exemplary pH adjusters include hydro \nchloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, Sodium hydroxide, \nammonium hydroxide and the like and may be present in the \nformulation between 0.1-5% w/w. \n\nThe formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal \ndrug delivery also include at least one lubricant. Lubricants \nhave several functions including preventing the adhesion of \nthe tablets to the compression equipment and in some cases \nimproving the flow of the granulation prior to compression or \nencapsulation.  Lubricants are in  most cases hydrophobic \nmaterials. Exemplary lubricants are selected from the group \nconsisting of Stearic acid and divalent cations of Such as \nmagnesium Stearate, calcium Stearate,  etc.,  talc,  glycerol \nmonostearate and the like. The lubricant is typically presentat \n0.01-10% w/w, preferably between 0.1-3% w/w. \n\nThe formulations of the invention for oral transmucosal \ndrug delivery may also include at least one glidant. Glidants \nare substances that improve the flow characteristics of the \nblended or granulated material from the hopper into the feed \ning mechanism and ultimately, in the tablet die. Exemplary \nglidants are selected from the group comprising colloidal \nsilicon dioxide, precipitated silicon dioxide, fumed silica \n(CAB-O-SIL  M-5P,  trademark  of Cabot  Corporation), \nstearowet and sterotex, silicas (such as SILOID and SILOX \nsilicas\u2014trademarks of Grace Davison Products, Aerosil\u2013 \ntrademark of Degussa Pharma), higher fatty acids, the metal \nsalts thereof, hydrogenated vegetable oils and the like. The \nglidant is  typically present at 0.01-20% w/w, preferably \nbetween 0.1-5% w/w. \n\nThe formulation may also contain flavors or Sweeteners \nand colorants such as aspartame, mannitol, lactose. Sucrose, \nother artificial sweeteners; ferric oxides and FD&C lakes. \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n14 \nThe formulation may also contain additives to help stabi \nlize the drug Substance from chemical of physical degrada \ntion.  Such degradation reactions  may include oxidation, \nhydrolysis,  aggregation,  deamidation,  etc.  Appropriate \nexcipients that can stabilize the drug Substance may include \nanti-oxidants, anti-hydrolytic agents, aggregation-blockers \netc. Anti-oxidants may include BHT, BHA, vitamins, citric \nacid, EDTA, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfate, thio \nurea,  amino acids  such as  methionine, etc.  Aggregation \nblockers may include Surfactants, amino-acids, such as argi \nnine, glycine, histidine, methionine etc. Additional excipients \nthat may help protect the active against degradation are salts, \npH adjusters, chelating agents and buffers in the dry or solu \ntion form. A number of salts may include all those known in \nthe art and may be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical \nSciences,  17th  Edition,  1985.  Exemplary  pH adjusters \ninclude  hydrochloric  acid,  acetic  acid,  phosphoric  acid, \nSodium  hydroxide,  ammonium hydroxide and the  like. \nExamples of such chelating agents include polylysine of dif \nferent molecular weights, disodium edetate, Sodium citrate, \ncondensed sodium phosphate and the like. Examples of salts \nand buffers may include at least of either organic (acetate, \ncitrate,  tartrate,  etc)  or inorganic  (phosphate,  carbonate, \nbicarbonate, borate, sulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, metabisulfite, \nchloride, etc.) salts of metals such as Sodium, potassium, \ncalcium, magnesium, etc), Further, combinations of one or \nmore of Such salts may be used to ensure adequate stabiliza \ntion of the drug in the dosage form. Stabilizing excipients \nmay be present at 0.01-15% w/w in the formulation, prefer \nably between 0.1-5% w/w. \n\nThe formulation may also contain Surfactants to increase \nwetting of the tablet, especially if faster release kinetics are \ndesired, which can result in faster initiation of mucoadhesion. \nSuch surfactants are generally present from 0.01  to 3% \nweight percent of the composition. Exemplary Surfactants are \nselected from the group consisting of ionic (Sodium lauryl \nSulfate, etc), non-ionic Such as polysorbates (Tween and Span \nSurfactant series), bile salts (such as Sodium taurocholate, \nSodium  taurodeoxycholate,  Sodium  glycodeoxycholate, \nSodium glycocholate, etc),  various alkyl glycosides, fatty \nacids,  phosphatidylcholines,  triglycerides,  sphingolipids, \nglycosylated lipids, PEGylated lipids and mixtures thereof. \nA dosage form of the invention may additionally comprise \none or more excipients that may affect both tablet disintegra \ntion kinetics and drug release from the tablet, and thus phar \nmacokinetics. Such disintegrants are known to those skilled \nin the art and may be selected from a group consisting of \nstarch, carboxy-methycellulose type or crosslinked Polyvinyl \nPyrrolidone (such as cross-povidone, PVP-XL), alginates, \ncellulose-based  disintegrants  (such  as  purified  cellulose, \nmethylcellulose, crosslinked sodium carboxy methylcellu \nlose (Ac-Di-Sol) and carboxy methyl cellulose), low substi \ntuted hydroxypropyl ethers of cellulose, microcrystalline cel \nlulose  (Such  as  Avicel),  ion  exchange  resins  (such  as \nAmbrelite IPR 88), gums (such as agar, locust bean, karaya, \nPectin and tragacanth), guar gums, gum Karaya, chitin and \nchitosan, Smecta, gellan gum, Isapghula Husk, Polacrillin \nPotassium (Tulsion), gas-evolving disintegrants (such as \ncitric acid and tartaric acid along with the Sodium bicarbon \nate, Sodium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate or calcium car \nbonate), Sodium starch glycolate (such as Explotab and Pri \nmogel), starch DC and the likes. Addition of such additives \nfacilitates the fast disintegration (or erosion) of the tablet into \nsmaller pieces that erode more rapidly. An additional benefit \nof inclusion of Such disintegrants in the formulations of the \npresent invention, is that the Smaller, drug-containing par \nticles formed upon disintegration have, by virtue of the highly \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n15 \nincreased surface area of contact with the oral mucosa, Supe \nrior bioadhesive properties. In addition, the increased surface \narea may further facilitate the fast release of the active sub \nstance and thus further accelerate drug absorption and attain \nment of the required therapeutic levels systemically. How \never, as described above, such disintegrants are used at a low \n% w/w level in the solid dosage form, typically 1-30% w/w \nrelative to the total weight of the dosage unit, preferably \n5-25% W/w. \n\nIn one aspect of the invention, the dosage forms may com \nprise one or more biodegradable polymers of any type useful \nfor Sustained drug release. Exemplary polymer compositions \ninclude polyanhydrides and co-polymers of lactic acid and \nglycolic acid, poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), poly \n(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), polyorthoe \nsters, proteins, and polysaccharides. \n\nOne method of making a formulation of the invention \nincludes the steps of weighing the drug and one or more of \nbioadhesives, binders, hydrogel forming excipients, bulking \nagents, lubricants or glidants and factors that affect dissolu \ntion time, possibly powder grinding, dry powder mixing and \ntableting via direct compression. Alternatively, a wet granu \nlation process may be used. Such a method (Such as high \nshear granulation process) involves mixing the active drug \nand possibly some excipients in a mixer. The binder may be \nadded in the mix dry or dissolved in the fluid used for granu \nlation. The granulating solution or Suspension is added to the \ndry powders in the mixer and mixed until the desired charac \nteristics are achieved. This usually produces granules of suit \nable  characteristics  for  producing  dosage  forms  with \nadequate dissolution time,  content uniformity, and other \nphysical characteristics. After the wet granulation step, the \nproduct is most often dried and/or then milled after drying to \nget a major percentage of the product within a desired size \nrange. Sometimes, the product is dried after being wet-sized \nusing a Suitable device, such as an oscillating granulator or a \nmill. The dry granulation mix may then processed to get an \nacceptable size range by first screening with a sieving device, \nand then milling the oversized particles. In some instances, an \nappropriate glidant is added to improve the flow properties of \nthe granules; Suitable glidants, as described above. \n\nA formulation of the invention may be manufactured by \nalternative granulation processes, all known to those skilled \nin the art, such as spray fluid bed granulation, extrusion and \nspheronization or fluid bed rotor granulation. \n\nA bioadhesive tablet may be made using a formulation of \nthe invention by coating a primary tablet with Suitable coat \nings known in the art. Such coatings are meant to protect the \nactive cores against damage (abrasion, breakage, dust forma \ntion) against influences to which the cores are exposed during \ntransport and storage (atmospheric humidity, temperature \nfluctuations), and naturally these film coatings can also be \ncolored. The sealing effect offilm coats against water vaporis \nexpressed by the water vapor permeability. Coating may be \nperformed by one of the well known processes such as \nWu\u0308rster coating, dry coating, film coating, fluid bed coating, \npan coating, etc. Typical coating materials include polyvinyl \npyrrolidone  (PVP),  polyvinyl  pyrrolidone  vinyl  acetate \ncopolymer (PVPVA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl \nalcohol/polyethylene glycol copolymer (PVA/PEG), gellan \ngum, maltodextrin, methyl cellulose, hydroxyl propyl methyl \ncellulose (HPMC of all grades and molecular weights), car \nrageenan and the like. \n\nIn one embodiment, the tablet core of the present invention \nmay be coated with a bioadhesive material. Such as those \ndefined above, to improve bioadhesion of the tablet in the \nSublingual cavity. In Such design, an eroding or hydrogel core \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n16 \nis  designed and coated with the appropriate bioadhesive \nmaterial, thus creating a design Such as that shown in FIG. 1. \nTo further facilitate the process, appropriate disintegrants \nmay be included in the core, as described above. \n\nIn another embodiment, the tablet core of the present \ninvention may be coated with a moisture-resistant coating, \nSuch as a hydrophobic polymers, including celluloses, etc., to \ncreate a barrier for moisture ingress in the tablet core and thus \nfurther protect moisture-sensitive drugs. In addition, Such \nwater-resistant coat may improve the tablet behavior during \nmanufacture by reducing its growth upon exposure to high% \nRH (relative humidity) environments, etc. A number of coat \ning materials can be used to improve the moisture resistance \nof the tablet such as EUDRAGITR) E PO, Opadry(RAMB, \nstarch acetate and the like. Of particular interest in this appli \ncation are coating materials that have very limited water \nuptake in <85% RH, yet rapidly absorb water at >85% RH. \nSuch a function would facilitate wetting of the dosage form in \nthe Sublingual environment yet protect the dosage form under \ntypical storage and moderate % RH conditions. \n\nIt will be understood that the formulation will be converted \ninto a dosage form for delivery to a Subject using procedures \nroutinely employed by those of skill in the art. The process for \npreparation of the dosage form is  optimized in  order to \nachieve high dose content uniformity, which is particularly \nimportant for the potent compounds, which are generally \npresent in mass ratios of 0.01-10% w/w. \n\nMany methods of making dosage forms for use in the \ninvention are known in the art and may be employed in \npracticing the present invention, Such as direct compression, \nwet granulation, etc. In preparing a small tablet, Such as a \nNanoTab(R), it has been shown that erosion time and adhesion \nare independent of tableting force between 2-500K psi. \n\nThe dosage forms of the invention are adapted to adhere to \nthe oral mucosa during the period of drug delivery, and until \nmost or all of the drug has been delivered from the dosage \nform via the oral mucosa. \n\nThe dosage  form  of the  current  invention  is  further \ndesigned to enable Sustained disintegration of the dosage over \na time period after application in an oral mucosal cavity in \nvivo. The dosage forms of this invention may be designed to \nerode within 30 seconds-8 hours after administration. Fur \nther, they are designed to provide a range of disintegration \nrates, from linear to biphasic over the entire duration of the \nprocess. \n\nIn addition, the oral transmucosal dosage forms of this \ninvention are designed to Sustain and control the release (dis \nSolution) of the drug from the dosage form after application to \nthe oral mucosa in vivo or in vitro. The drug dissolution from \nthese Sustained-release transmucosal dosage forms can fol \nlow first or second order dissolution kinetics which can be \nmanipulated to achieve the optimal in vivo pharmacokinetic \nprofile and pharmacological action. \n\nIn certain embodiments of the invention, the drug dosage \nform is adapted to deliver 30% or more of the total amount of \ndrug contained in a single drug dosage form to an individual \nvia the oral mucosa. In other embodiments the percentage of \nthe total amount of drug contained in a single drug dosage \ndelivered  transmucosally  may be  greater  than  30-40%. \n40-50%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-90% and preferably greater \nthan 95%. In exemplary embodiments, at least 35%, 40%, \n45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, \n95%, 98% or 99%, of the total amount of drug contained in a \nsingle drug dosage form is delivered via the oral mucosa. \n\nIn certain embodiments of the invention, the drug dosage \nform is adapted to deliver no more than 60% of the total \namount of drug contained in a single drug dosage form to an \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n17 \nindividual via the GI tract. In other embodiments the percent \nage delivered via the GI tract maybe lower, such that not more \nthan 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5% or 1% of the total \namount of drug contained in the drug dosage form is delivered \nto the individual via the GI tract. \n\nThe delivery of a greater percentage (and amount) of drug \nvia the oral mucosa and the corresponding lack of delivery via \nthe GI tract provides a significant improvement over prior \nmethods of drug delivery. \n\nOne preferred site for drug delivery is the sublingual area, \nalthough in certain embodiments it may be advantageous for \nthe dosage form to be placed inside the cheek, or to adhere to \nthe roof of the mouth or the gum. \n\nMinimizing the saliva response produces a delivery profile \nthat is consistent and predictable from patient to patient, \nwhich is  not the case with oral lozenge formulations that \nproduce a significant  saliva  response.  A reduced saliva \nresponse is particularly important for drugs with poor bio \navailability through the GI tract. \n\nSublingual delivery is preferred as the Sublingual mucosa \nis more readily permeable to medications than other mucosal \nareas, such as the buccal mucosa, resulting in more rapid \nuptake (Shojaei A. H. et al. Buccal mucosa as a route for \nsystemic drug delivery: a review. Journal of Pharmacy and \nPharmaceutical Sciences. 1:15-30, 1998). \n\nThe formulations of the invention also provide improved \ndissolution profiles over previous oral or oral transmucosal \nformulations,  efficacious  delivery  of drug  via  the  oral \nmucosa, and a consistent plasma level within the therapeutic \nwindow. \n\nThe decreased Swallowing of drug and more consistent \nuptake of oral transmucosal dosage forms made using the \nformulations of the present invention result in peak plasma \nlevels that are more consistent between individual dosages as \ncompared to those using commercially available formula \ntions. \n\nDosage forms comprising a formulation of the present \ninvention are designed to work effectively in the unique envi \nronment of the oral cavity such that a limited amount of fluid, \nthe relatively short period of time for drug delivery, and the \npH levels within the oral cavity do not adversely affect \nabsorption of the drug. The formulations are also designed to \nimprove dissolution, solubility, and stability of the drug dos \nage form. The advantages of the present invention contribute \nto the ability of the drug formulation to provide higher levels \nof drug absorption via the oral transmucosal route and con \nsistent dose-to-effect times, making the present formulation a \nsignificant improvement for the treatment of acute or break \nthrough pain. \n\nThe formulations of the present invention are designed to \navoid the high peak plasma levels of immediate-release liquid \nformulations by controlling both tablet disintegration (or ero \nsion) and drug dissolution and release from the tablet to \nenable more consistent delivery. The formulations of the \npresent invention may be used to provide single or individual, \nrepetitive doses that include a defined amount of the active \nagent, thereby allowing the patient to accurately titrate the \namount of drug delivered and to adjust the amount as appro \npriate in a safe and effective manner. \n\nThe advantage of the Sustained-release oral transmucosal \nformulations described in this invention is that they can main \ntain the plasma drug concentration within a targeted thera \npeutic window for a longer duration than immediate release \nformulations, whether Solid dosage forms or liquid-based \ndosage forms. The high peak plasma levels typically observed \nfor Such conventional immediate release formulations are \nblunted by the sustained release of the drug. In addition, a \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n18 \nrapid decline in plasma levels is avoided since the drug will \ncontinually cross through the oral cavity into the systemic \ncirculation during the entire process of tablet dissolution, thus \nproviding plasma pharmacokinetics with a more stable pla \nteau. In addition, the dosage forms described in this invention \nmay improve treatment safety by minimizing the potentially \ndeleterious side effects due to the reduction of the peaks and \ntroughs in the plasma drug pharmacokinetics, which compro \nmise treatment safety. \n\nThe oral transmucosal bioadhesive formulations of the \npresent invention are typically designed to disintegrate (or \ntotally erode) from within 30 seconds up to  1  minute, 2 \nminutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 \nminutes, 30 minutes, 1  hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours or \nlonger dependent upon the patient and circumstances of drug \nadministration as well as the intrinsic drug pharmacokinetics. \nIt will be understood that the composition of the oral trans \nmucosal  formulations  of the  present  invention  may be \nadjusted to provide both a range of doses and a range of \ndissolution times to fit particular clinical situations. \n\nDissolution times for sublingual administration of the for \nmulations of the invention will vary from 30 seconds up to 1 \nminute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 min \nutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours \nor longer. \n\nThe oral  transmucosal dosage forms of invention are \ndesigned to fit comfortably under the tongue such that the \ndrug form disintegrates Sufficiently slowly to avoid the imme \ndiate peak plasma levels followed by significant drop off seen \nin prior art formulations such as described in U.S. Pat. No. \n6,759,059, wherein fentanyl was administered via tablets \ncontaining 400 ug offentanyl which resulted in a peak plasma \nlevel of 2.5 ng/ml at 5 minutes post-administration, followed \nby an immediate drop in plasma level. \n\nThe formulations of the present invention will be provided \nin a number of dosage forms that vary according to the nature \nand amount of active ingredients while maintaining the fea \ntures of the formulations of the invention for dissolution in the \noral cavity Such that a greater percentage of drug absorption \ntakes place via the oral mucosal route and not the GI route. \nIn one aspect of the invention, when a homogeneous dos \nage form comprising a formulation according to the present \ninvention is placed in the Sublingual cavity, preferably under \nthe tongue on either side of the frenulum linguae, where it \nadheres upon contact. While not wishing to be bound by \ntheory, it appears that when a dosage form comprising a \nformulation of the invention is exposed to the moisture of the \nSublingual space the dosage form absorbs water, resulting in \nthe formation of a hydrogel network. In a preferred embodi \nment, the hydrogel formulation is designed to form a film \nwhich is visible in the sublingual space following tablet dis \nintegration. Upon placement on the oral mucosa, the dosage \nform absorbs water such that upon full hydration, it spreads \nacross the mucosal Surface, thus transforming into a bioad \nhesive film containing the active drug. This transformation \nresults in a significant increase of the Surface area available \nfor drug release, thus accelerating drug diffusion and release \nfrom the dosage form. \n\nHydrogel formation in the dosage forms of the invention \ntakes place in the presence of certain hydrogel-enabling \nexcipients that have the capacity to absorb water and form \ngels. Such excipients include Polyox of all grades, polyeth \nylene  glycols  (of  all  grades),  PEG-based  copolymers, \nwhether homopolymers or heteropolymers (such as Polox \namer, etc), Dextran, HPMC, starch, etc., as detailed above. In \naddition, any combination of Such excipients  may favor \nhydrogel formation upon contact with bodily fluids.  In a \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n19 \ncertain embodiment of the present invention, combinations of \nSuch hydrogel forming excipients with excipients that do not \nfavor gel formation (i.e., don\u2019t have Such a capacity to Swell), \ne.g., certain celluloses and the like also result in formation of \nhydrogel structures, albeit with a lower gelling capacity. \n\nIn another aspect of the invention, dosage forms referred to \nherein as \"eroding-type' dosage forms are provided. Such \n\"eroding-type' dosage forms, although they may absorb sig \nnificant amounts of water (depending on their composition) \nthey do not have the same capacity of Swelling and do not \nform gels as described for the hydrogel type formulations \ndefined above. These \u201ceroding-type' formulations adhere to \nthe Sublingual cavity upon contact, similar to the hydrogel \nformulations. However, in contrast to hydrogels, they follow \na Surface-erosion mechanism without prior formation of a \nhydrated gel. As an \"eroding-type' dosage form is exposed to \nthe moisture of the sublingual space, the surface of the tablet \nhydrates and erodes thereby exposing the underlying layers; \nas the Subsequent layers become hydrated they Subsequently \nerode and so on, thus resulting in a continuous reduction in \nthe size of the tablet. \n\nIn a preferred embodiment, such eroding formulations are \ndesigned to form a film which is visible in the sublingual \nspace following tablet disintegration. Upon placement on the \noral mucosa, the dosage form absorbs water Such that upon \nfull hydration, it spreads across the mucosal Surface, thus \ntransforming into a bioadhesive film containing the active \ndrug. This transformation results in a significant increase of \nthe Surface area available for drug release, thus accelerating \ndrug diffusion and release from the dosage form. Owing to the \nhigher contact surface area, drug absorption occurs fast, \nresulting in fast onset of action. \n\nSuch eroding-type dosage forms are typically character \nized by a lack of inclusion of hydrogel-forming excipients \nand in particular Polyox (of all grades) PEG-based copoly \nmers, whether homopolymers or heteropolymers (such as \nPoloxamer, etc), HPMC, etc. However, it will be understood \nthat the percentage w/w composition of the various compo \nnents of the dosage form will impact the mechanism of ero \nSion.  For example, Small amounts of particular hydrogel \nenabling excipients may not induce formation of a hydrogel \nand as  Such, some hydrogel-enabling excipients may be \nincluded in eroding formulations without changing their ero \nSion-based disintegration mechanism. It is both the combina \ntion of excipients and their percent weight composition that \ngives a hydrogel its capacity to maintain a structural matrix \nupon contact with an aqueous Solution. Therefore, inclusion \nof a hydrogel-forming excipient in a given formulation will \nnot necessarily induce \u201cswelling as with the typical hydrogel \nformulations. Both hydrogel-forming and eroding-type for \nmulations of the invention provide control of the drug disso \nlution and/or in vivo absorption kinetics to enable enhanced \nbioavailability and improved efficacy. \n\nThe formulations of the invention find particular utility in \npediatric  applications,  since the  comfortable and secure \nnature of the dosage form will allow small children to readily \naccept this mode of therapy and will reliably deliver drug \ntransmucosally. Specific examples include, but are not lim \nited to, treatment ofpediatric acute pain when IV access is not \navailable or inconvenient, treatment ofpediatric asthma when \nthe child is notable to use an inhaled route of administration \neffectively, treatment of nausea when a child can not or will \nnot Swallow a pill, pre-procedural sedation when a child is \nNPO (no oral  intake allowed) or a  more rapid onset is \nrequired. \n\nSimilarly, the formulations of the invention find particular \nutility in geriatric applications, since the comfortable and \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n20 \nsecure nature of the dosage form will allow elderly patients to \nreadily accept this mode of therapy and will reliably deliver \ndrug transmucosally. Specific examples include, but are not \nlimited to, treatment of nausea when a elderly patient can't \nSwallow a pill, acute pain when IV access is not available or \ninconvenient, pre-procedural sedation when a child is NPO \n(no oral intake allowed) or a more rapid onset is required, etc. \nThe formulations of the invention find further utility in \nVeterinary applications. Specific examples include, but are \nnot limited to, any treatment of an acute condition for which \nIV administration is not readily available or inconvenient, \nSuch as pain relief, anxiety/stress relief, pre-procedural seda \ntion, etc. \n\nIV.

Such applicators are \ncapable of enabling accurate placement of the dosage forms \nof the present invention in the oral transmucosal cavity, and \npreferably the sublingual area. \n\nPharmaceutically active agents for use in a formulation of \nthe invention are characterized by logarithm of the octanol \nwater partition coefficient (Log P) between 0.006 and 3.382. \nFormulations of the Invention for Suppression or Mitiga \n\ntion of Pain. \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\nIn one exemplary application, the formulations of the \ninvention find utility in treating a subject Suffering from pain \nthat may be associated with any of a variety of identifiable or \nunidentifiable etiologies. The formulations of the invention \nfind utility in Suppression or mitigation of pain. The term \n\u201ctreatment\u2019 or \u201cmanagement  of pain is used here to gener \nally describe regression, Suppression, or mitigation of pain so \nas to make the subject more comfortable, as determined for \nexample by pain score. \n\nThe term \u201cacute pain' is used herein with reference to pain \nthat is typically present for less than one month, however, in \nSome cases pain that, is present for as long as three months \nmay also be considered to be \u201cacute\u201d. \n\nThe term \"chronic pain' is used herein with reference to \n\npain that is typically present for longer than one month. \n\nIn one exemplary aspect, the invention relates to oral trans \nmucosal delivery of a formulation for pain-relief comprising \na drug such as an opioid or opioidagonist, for the treatment of \nacute or break-through pain. \n\nThe active agent in Such formulations may include Sufen \ntanil, or a Sufentanil congener Such as alfentanil, fentanyl. \nlofentanil, carfentanil, remifentanil, trefentanil, or mirfenta \nnil.  One preferred embodiment utilizes  sufentanil as the \nactive agent. Another preferred embodiment utilizes fentanyl \nas the active agent. Other preferred embodiments utilize \nalfentanil, lofentanil, carfentanil, remifentanil, trefentanil, or \nmirfentanilas the active agent. Yet another preferred embodi \nment utilizes a combination of Sufentanil and at least one \nadditional agent for treatment of analgesia as the active agent. \nIn alternative embodiments, a formulation of the invention \nincludes a combination of two or more opioid analogues. Such \nas Sufentanil plus an opioid such as fentanyl, alfentanil, \ntrefentanil, mirfentanil or remifentanil. Various opioid drugs \nhave different pharmacokinetic profiles and different interac \ntions with mu opioid receptor splice variants and, therefore, \nmay be used in combination to enhance the therapeutic effect. \nFor example, sufentanil combined with fentanyl may have a \nrapid onset due to the sufentanil with a slower loss of anal \ngesia due to the fentanyl. \n\nIn alternative embodiments, the drug dosage form of the \ninvention may include at least one opioid drug and one or \nmore other drugs wherein the other drug may be an opioid or \nnon-opioid drug. The oral transmucosal drug delivery formu \nlations are useful for delivery of any active drug compound \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n22 \nand treatment of any condition wherein the active drug com \npound may be delivered via the oral mucosal route. \n\nThe formulation of the invention may contain a highly \npotent opioid, Such as Sufentanil, fentanyl or a Sufentanil \ncongener. \n\nIn one exemplary embodiment of the invention, each dos \nage form contains from about 0.25 to about 200 ug of Sufen \ntanil,  in combination with one or more other therapeutic \nagents or drugs. \n\nIn yet another example of the invention, each dosage form \ncontains from about 2 to about 1500 g offentanyl, in com \nbination with one or more other therapeutic agents or drugs. \nIn some embodiments, the oral dosage formulations of the \ninvention include an opioid antagonist, Such as naloxone. In \nSuch embodiments, naloxone is provided in an appropriate \nconcentration to inhibit activity of the opioid component of \nthe formulation were it to be injected. \n\nThe invention finds utility in the treatment of both opioid \n\nnaive patients and opioid tolerant patients. \n\nThe term \u201copioid naive patient' is used herein with refer \nence to a patient who has not received repeated administration \nof an opioid substance over a period of weeks to months. \n\nThe term \u201copioid tolerant patient\u2019 as used herein means a \nphysiological state characterized by a decrease in the effects \nof an opioid substance (e.g., analgesia, nausea or sedation) \nwith chronic administration. An opioid Substance is a drug, \nhormone, or other chemical Substance that has analgesic, \nsedative and/or narcotic effects similar to those containing \nopium or its derivatives. If analgesic tolerance develops, the \ndose of opioid substance is increased to result in the same \nlevel of analgesia. This tolerance may not extend to side \neffects and side effects may not be well tolerated as the dose \nis increased. \n\nIn certain embodiments, a dosage form comprising a for \nmulation of the invention contains at least 0.001% percent by \nweight of the active ingredient. Preferably, the dosage form \ncomprises from about at least 0.005% to as much as 99.9% by \nweight, 0.05% to 99%, 0.01% to 50%, 0.1% to 10% of the \nactive ingredient. In certain other embodiments, a dosage \nform comprising a formulation of the invention contains as \nmuch as 10 ug, 15 Jug, 25 Jug, 50 Lig, 100 ug, 500 ug, 1  mg, 2 \nmg, 3 mg, 4 mg, 5 mg, 6 mg, 7 mg. 8 mg.9 mg or 10 mg of the \nactive ingredient or drug. \n\nThe percentage of active ingredient(s) will vary dependent \nupon the size of the dosage form and nature of the active \ningredient(s), optimized to obtain maximal delivery via the \noral mucosal route. In some aspects of the invention more \nthan one active ingredient may be included in a single dosage \nform \n\nIn one exemplary embodiment, a dosage form for use in the \ntreatment of pain may comprise from about 0.25 to about 200 \nug of sufentanil, from about 2.5 to about 100g of sufentanil, \nfrom about 2.5 to about 40 g of sufentanil, from about 2.5 to \nabout 15.0 ug of sufentanil, from about 2.0 to about 1500 g \noffentanyl, from about 50 to about 1500 ug offentanyl, or \nfrom about 200 to about 1500 lug offentanyl. \n\nIn various embodiments, the formulation of the present \ninvention generally provides appropriate pain relief in all \ntypes of patients including children, and adults of all ages \nwho are opioid tolerant or naive. The invention finds utility in \nboth the in-patient and out-patient setting. \n\nThe clinical use of sufentanil has predominantly been lim \nited to IV administration in operating rooms or intensive care \nunits. As further described herein, there have been a few \nstudies on the use of liquid Sufentanil preparations for low \ndose intranasal administration and a case report of sublingual \ndelivery of a liquid Sufentanil preparation. In most of these \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n23 \nstudies, the Smallest dosing of Sufentanil in adults was 5ug in \nopioid naive patients. Intranasal bioavailability was approxi \nmately 75% of that obtained by IV, however no pharmacoki \nnetic data has been published on the Sublingual use of Sufen \ntanil. \n\nThe bioadhesive transmucosal formulations of the inven \ntion contain from about 0.25 to about 200g of sufentanil per \ndosage form for oral transmucosal delivery. As will be under \nstood by those of skill in the art, the dose will be on the low \nend of the range for children and the high end of the range for \nadults dependent upon body mass, in particular when admin \nistered long-term to opioid-tolerant adults. Small-volume \noral transmucosal drug delivery dosage forms of Sufentanil \nhave not been described. \n\nExemplary formulations of the invention for administra \ntion to children (pediatric patients) contain from about 0.25 to \nabout 120 ug of Sufentanil per dosage form. For example, a \nformulation of the invention for administration to children \nmay contain about 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 40, \n60 or 120 ug of sufentanil for oral transmucosal delivery. It \nfollows that for pediatric patients, an exemplary dose range is \nfrom at least about 0.02  g/kg to about 0.5 ug/kg with a \npreferable range of from about 0.05 to about 0.1  g/kg. \n\nExemplary formulations of the invention for administra \ntion to adults contain from about 2.5 to about 200 lug of \nSufentanil per dosage form. For example, a formulation of the \ninvention for administration to adults may contain about 2.5, \n3, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 180 or 200 ug \nor more of sufentanil for oral transmucosal delivery. \n\nThe dosage forms of the invention contain from about 2 to \nabout 1500 ug offentanyl per dosage form for oral transmu \ncosal delivery. As will be understood by those of skill in the \nart, the dose will be on the low end of the range for children \nand the high end of the range for adults dependent upon body \nmass, in particular when administered long term to opioid \ntolerant adults. \n\nExemplary dosage forms of the invention for administra \ntion to children (pediatric patients) contain from about 2 to \nabout 900 ug offentanyl per dosage form. For example, a \ndosage form of the invention for administration to children \nmay contain about 2, 3.75, 7.5, 18.75, 30, 37.5, 45, 60, 75, \n112.5, 150, 300, 450 or 900 ug offentanyl for oral transmu \ncosal delivery. \n\nExemplary dosage forms of the invention for administra \ntion to adults contain from about 18.75 to about 1500 ug of \nfentanyl per dosage form. For example, a dosage form of the \ninvention for administration to  adults may contain about \n18.75, 22.5, 37.5,56, 75, 112.5, 150,300,450, 600, 750,900, \n1050, 1350 or 1500 ug or more offentanyl for oral transmu \ncosal delivery. \n\nThe dosage forms of the invention contain from about 10 to \nabout 10000 ug of alfentanil per dosage form for oral trans \nmucosal delivery. As will be understood by those of skill in \nthe art, the dose will be on the low end of the range for \nchildren and the high end of the range for adults dependent \nupon body mass, in particular when administered long term to \nopioid-tolerant adults. \n\nExemplary dosage forms of the invention for administra \ntion of alfentanil contain from about 10 ug to about 10 mg of \nalfentanil per dosage form. For example, a dosage form of the \ninvention for administration may contain about 10, 25, 50. \n150, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 7000, \n9000 or 10000 ug of alfentanil for oral transmucosal delivery. \nIn a different exemplary embodiment, a dosage form for \nuse in the treatment of pain may comprise from about 0.25 to \nabout 200 ug of sufentanil in combination with from about 2 \nto about 1500 ug offentanyl or from about 0.25 to about 200 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n24 \nug of sufentanilor from about 2 to about 1500 lug offentanyl \nin combination with one or more additional drugs. \n\nRemifentanil, lofentanil, carfentanil, trefentanil and mir \nfentanil are potent fentanyl congeners which may be suitable \nfor treatment of acute pain when delivered via a bioadhesive \ntransmucosal formulation of this invention. The dose ranges \nfor exemplary formulations of these congeners may include \n0.25ug to 99.9 mg for both adult and pediatric patients. These \ndosages may be repeated at appropriate time intervals, Suit \nably defined for each molecule. \n\nAlfentanil is also a potent fentanyl congener that is rapidly \nmetabolized and may be suitable for use when delivered via a \nbioadhesive  transmucosal  formulation  of this  invention. \nAppropriate dosing of alfentanil may be in the range of 10 ug \nto 10 mg for both adult and pediatric patients. These dosages \nmay be repeated at appropriate time intervals. \n\nPatients suffering from chronic painful conditions can also \nhave intermittent exacerbations of their pain, requiring acute \nuse of fast-acting breakthrough opioids in addition to their use \nof slow-onset time-release opioids for their baseline chronic \npain. \n\nBreakthrough pain or procedural pain can be intense for \nshort periods of time, as short as 1 or 2 minutes or as long as \n30 minutes or more, therefore there would be a significant \nadvantage in providing an opioid formulation that produced \nmore rapid clinically effective plasma levels with a more \nconsistent and predictable period of effect. \n\nOpioids remain the most powerful from of analgesics, \nhowever, improved forms are needed that have minimal side \neffects, and can be provided in a manner in which patient use \ncan be easily tracked by the physician. \n\nUsing current treatment methods, pain control is attempted \nusing a number of interventions, which generally include: \nintravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), continuous \nepidural infusion (CEI), other types of acute pain control, \npalliative care pain control, and home health patient pain \ncontrol. These methods meet with varying degrees of success \nwith respect to duration of control, ease of treatment and \nsafety versus side effects. \n\nThe need for rapid treatment of acute pain occurs in many \ndifferent clinical situations, including post-operative recu \nperation, rheumatoid arthritis, failed back, end-stage cancer, \netc. Post-operatively, for example, patients suffer from severe \npain for the first few days followed by days of mild to mod \nerate levels of pain. \n\nThe most common analgesic used to treat moderate to \nsevere post-operative pain is  IV morphine. This is either \ndelivered on an \u201cas needed  basis by a nurse to the patient by \nan IV injection or commonly a morphine Syringe is placed in \na PCA pump and the patient self-administers the opioid by \npressing abutton which has a lock-out feature. Other opioids, \nSuch as hydromorphone and fentanyl may also be used in this \n\na. \nTreatment of acute pain is also necessary for patients in an \noutpatient setting. For example, many patients suffer from \nchronic pain and require the use of opioids on a weekly or \ndaily basis to treat their pain. While they may have a long \nacting oral or transdermal opioid preparations to treat their \nchronic underlying pain levels, they often need short-acting \npotent opioids to treat their severe breakthrough pain levels. \nTreatment of acute pain is also necessary \u201cin the field' \nunder highly sub-optimal conditions. Paramedics or military \nmedics often are required to treat severe acute pain in un \nsterile situations, where needles used for IV or IM adminis \ntration can result in unintended needle Sticks, risk of infec \ntion, etc. Oral opioid tablets often take 60 minutes to provide \nrelief which is too long for someone in severe pain. \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n25 \nIn a number of clinical settings, there is clearly a need for \na formulation that produces effective pain relief in a manner \nthat is titratable, may be used safely and conveniently, and \nprovides pain relief for severe breakthrough or intermittent \npain over an appropriate period of time. \n\n5 \n\nV. Use of Formulations of the Invention \n\nOral transmucosal drug delivery is simple, non-invasive, \nand can be administered by the caregiver or the patient with \nminimal discomfort. Generally, oral transmucosal delivery of \npharmaceuticals is achieved using Solid dosage forms such as \nlozenges or tablets, however, liquids, sprays, gels, gums, \npowders, and films may also be used. \n\nFor certain drugs, such as those with poor bioavailability  15 \n\n10 \n\nvia the GI tract, such as many lipophilic opioids, oral trans \nmucosal (OT) delivery may provide a better delivery route \nthan GI delivery. For drugs such as opioids, oral transmucosal \ndelivery has shorter onset time (i.e., the time from adminis \ntration to therapeutic effect) than does oral GI delivery and \nprovides significantly improved bioavailability. \n\nPharmacokinetics (PK) and Formulation Attributes \nThe uptake of medications from the bioadhesive transmu \ncosal formulations of the present invention results in a more \nconsistent delivery between individual dosages and indi \nvidual patients as compared to that of currently available oral \ntransmucosal dosage forms for which a large fraction of drug \nuptake occurs via the GI route. \n\nThe bioadhesive transmucosal formulations of the present \ninvention are designed to work effectively in the unique envi \nronment of the oral cavity such that a limited amount of fluid, \na relatively short period of time for drug dissolution, and pH \nlevels within the oral cavity do not adversely affect absorption \nof the drug (FIG. 11). The dosage forms are also designed to \nimprove dissolution, solubility, and stability of the drug. The \nadvantages of the present invention include the ability to \nprovide higher levels of drug absorption via oral transmu \ncosal delivery, and consistent dose-to-effect times, making \nthe present formulation a significant improvement for the \ntreatment of acute or break-through pain. \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\nThe oral transmucosal formulations of the present inven \ntion are designed to avoid the high peak plasma levels of \nintravenous dosage forms by utilizing the oral mucosa and by \ncontrolling both tablet disintegration (or erosion) and drug \ndissolution and release from the tablet over time to provide a 45 \nsafer delivery profile. The oral transmucosal formulations of \nthe present invention provide individual, repetitive doses that \ninclude a defined amount of the active agent, thereby allowing \nthe patient to accurately titrate the amount of drug delivered \nand to adjust the amount as appropriate in a safe and effective  50 \n\na. \nAn advantage of the bioadhesive oral transmucosal formu \nlations described in this invention is that they exhibit consis \ntent bioavailability and can maintain the plasma drug concen \ntration  within  a  targeted  therapeutic  window  with  55 \nsignificantly lower variability for a longer duration than cur \nrently available Solid dosage forms. The high peak plasma \nlevels typically observed for IV dosage forms are blunted \nfollowing administration of a formulation of the invention, \nwhich are characterized by sustained release of the drug. In  60 \naddition, a rapid decline in plasma levels is avoided since the \ndrug is continually crossing from the oral cavity into the \nbloodstream during the length of time of dissolution of the \ntablet or longer, thus providing plasma pharmacokinetics \nwith an extended plateau phase as compared to the IV route of 65 \nadministration. Further, the dosage forms of this invention \nmay improve treatment safety by minimizing the potentially \n\n26 \ndeleterious side effects due to the relative reduction of the \npeaks and troughs in the plasma drug pharmacokinetics, \nwhich compromise treatment safety and is typical of cur \nrently available dosage forms. \n\nAdvantages of solid Sublingual formulations of the present \ninvention over various liquid forms for either sublingual or \nintranasal administration of opioids include the Sustained \nlocal release of the Solid dosage form and the avoidance of \nSwallowing of drug from administration of liquid dosage \nforms either via the nasal or the oral route. Published phar \nmacokinetic data on intranasal Sufentanil liquid administra \ntion (15ug) in humans demonstrates a bioavailability of 78% \n(Helmers et al.  Comparison of intravenous and intranasal \nSufentanil absorption and sedation. Canadian Journal of Ana \nesthesia  36:494-497,  1989).  Sublingual liquid  sufentanil \nadministration (5ug) in Beagle dogs (Example 8) resulted in \na bioavailability of 40%. Both these bioavailabilities are less \nthan the 91% average that was obtained in human volunteers \nusing Sufentanil administered Sublingually in the form of a \nNanoTab(R) formulation of the invention or greater than the \n75% bioavailability obtained in the animal studies (Examples \n7-12 below). \n\nThe oral transmucosal dosage forms of the invention are \ndesigned to fit comfortably under the tongue such that the \ndrug-loaded dosage form disintegrates Sufficiently slowly to \navoid the immediate peak plasma levels followed by signifi \ncant drop-off seen in prior art formulations such as described \nin U.S. Pat. No. 6,759,059 (Rapinyl), wherein fentanyl was \nadministered via tablets containing 400g offentanyl which \nresulted in a peak plasma level of 2.5 ng/mL followed by an \nimmediate drop in plasma levels. Fentora (fentanyl buccal \ntablets) also suffers from a lack of a plateau phase but rather \nhas a steep incline up to the C  followed by a significant \ndrop-off in plasma levels (Fentora package insert). \n\nThe bioadhesive transmucosal formulations described in \nthis invention are designed to form two specific kinds of \ndelivery vehicles: hydrogels and eroding tablets. These fol \nlow two distinct disintegration and drug release mechanisms \nbased on (i) diffusion from a hydrogel and (ii) erosion with \ndiffusion from the eroding-type tablets. Using these funda \nmental designs the formulations of the invention can be \ndesigned to be fast-,  intermediate- or slow-disintegrating. \nThese system architectures are vastly different from efferves \ncent-type tablets which are designed to breakdown rapidly by \nuse of carbonate-type (or other) excipients. In addition, they \nare  fundamentally  different  from dosage forms that are \ndesigned to disintegrate into large carrierparticles that carry \nthe Smaller (typically micron-sized) drug particles following \nordered  mixing. The architecture of the transmucosal for \nmulations of the present invention does not pose any require \nments for specific particle sizes of drug or excipient particles, \nnor does require disintegration to the  drug-coated  carrier \nparticles to achieve the desired performance. \n\nThe bioadhesive transmucosal formulations of the present \ninvention can be designed to manipulate and control the phar \nmacokinetic profile of the active drug. As such, the formula \ntions can be adjusted to achieve fast disintegration and fast \ndrug release and thus enable fast pharmacokinetic profiles \nthat provide fast onset of action, while maintaining the other \nperformance attributes of the tablet such as bioadhesion, \nreproducibility of action, blunted C, etc. Such fast-disin \ntegrating tablets  may be engineered to  disintegrate from \nwithin 30 seconds up to 20 minutes and enable pharmacoki \nnetic profiles that can vary accordingly with duration of \naction that can vary from 10 minutes to 1-2 hours. Alterna \ntively,  the formulations of the present invention  can be \nadjusted to achieve  intermediate  erosion times and drug \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n27 \nrelease and thus enable  intermediate pharmacokinetic pro \nfiles that provide a more Sustained action. Although Such \nformulations may still provide a fast onset of action, they are \nmostly designed to enable the longer sustained effect while \nmaintaining the other performance attributes of the tablet \nSuch as bioadhesion, reproducibility of action, blunted C, \netc. Such  intermediate-disintegrating tablets may be engi \nneered to disintegrate from within 30 seconds up to 30 min \nutes  and enable pharmacokinetic profiles  that  can  vary \naccordingly. Finally, the formulations of the present invention \ncan be adjusted to achieve  slow disintegration times (and \nerosion kinetic profiles) and slow drug release and thus enable \nvery prolonged PK that provides Sustained drug action. \nAlthough Such formulations may be designed to still provide \na fast onset, they are mostly intended to enable the Sustained \ndrug PK and effect while maintaining the other performance \nattributes of the tablet such as bioadhesion, reproducibility of \naction, blunted C, etc. Such slowly-disintegrating tablets \nmay be engineered to disintegrate from within 15 minutes to \nup to 8 hours and enable pharmacokinetic profiles that can \nvary accordingly. \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\nFurther, the bioadhesive transmucosal dosage formula \ntions of this invention can exhibit the aforementioned perfor \nmance with a number of active drugs that may span a wide \nrange of physicochemical properties, such as water solubility, \npartition coefficient, etc., as further described herein. \n\nIn addition, an important advantage exhibited by the oral \ntransmucosal formulations of the present invention is the \npH-independent nature of drug dissolution for drugs over the \nrange of pH 4.5 and 8.0. pH-independence of drug dissolution \nminimizes the effect of environmental conditions on drug \ndissolution and absorption and provides consistently high \nbioavailability as described above. Further, normal physi \nologic or disease state saliva pH is typically between 4.5-8.0. \nThus, the pH-independence of drug dissolution over a pH \nrange of 4.5-8.0 exhibited by formulations of the invention \nprovides advantages over prior art formulations. \n\nFinally, the performance and attributes of the bioadhesive \ntransmucosal formulations of this invention are independent \nof the manufacturing process. A number of conventional, \nwell-established and known in the art processes can be used to \nmanufacture the formulations of the present invention (Such \nas wet and dry granulation, direct compression, etc). without \nimpacting the dosage form physicochemical properties or in \nVivo performance. \n\nPharmacokinetics\u2014Animal Studies \nSelected dosage forms comprising formulations of the \ninvention were tested in a suitable animal model to evaluate \nthe pharmacokinetics following Sublingual administration \nand thus elucidate the properties of the formulations of the \npresent invention. Comparisons of oral transmucosal drug \ndelivery using formulations of the invention relative to liquid \nsublingual administration as well as swallowed NanoTabs(R) \nwere made to evaluate their performance. The results support \nour claim that the bioadhesive formulations of the invention \nare well tolerated Sublingually in dogs, result in higher bio \navailability and more consistent pharmacokinetic profiles \nthan  other  oral  transmucosal  dosage  forms,  including \ninstilled liquids. Further, they demonstrate the ability of the \ntransmucosal formulations of this invention to blunt the C. \nand modify the drug absorption profile to achieve fast, inter \nmediate or prolonged absorption. \n\nIn order to demonstrate the broad applicability of the bio \nadhesive transmucosal dosage forms of this invention, formu \nlations were prepared with three different opioids: Sufentanil \ncitrate, fentanyl citrate and alfentanil hydrochloride. These \nmolecules, albeit members of the same opioid family of anal \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n28 \ngesics, span a wide range of log P values (between 0.006 and \n3.382), as shown in Table 1A. The ability of the formulations \nof the current invention to similarly manipulate the in vivo \npharmacokinetics of these distinct molecules in vivo demon \nstrates the broad applicability of the formulations of the \npresent invention to a wide range of molecules with distinct \nphysicochemical characteristics. \n\nTABLE 1A \n\nPhysicochemical Properties of Selected Opioids. \n\nMolecule \nProperty \n\nSufentani \n\nFentanyl \n\nAlfentani \n\nMolecular Weight (Da) \nSolubility in water \nlogP (ofw) \nT  (C.) \npKa \nTherapeutic Index \n\n387.5 \n97  g/mL \n3.382 \n97 \n8.01 \n\n25,000 \n\n336.5 \n200  g/mL. \n2.928 \n87 \n8.43 \n\n300 \n\n416.2 \n130 mg/mL \nO.OO6 \n\n140.8 \n6.5 \n\n1OOO \n\nOne study was carried out to compare a Sublingual 5 Jug \nSufentanil  NanoTab(R)  formulation  to  IV  sufentanil  as \ndescribed more fully in Example 7 (Table 12). A total of three \nBeagle dogs were studied and the results of the pharmacoki \nnetic analysis are presented in FIG.3 and tabulated in Table \n13. All tablets disintegrated in <20 min following adminis \ntration in dogs. The bioavailability sufentanil from the sub \nlingual NanoTabR formulation was 74.8+10.7 compared to \nIV, thus confirming the superior attributes of the formulation \nover other dosage forms or formulation types (effervescent, \netc). The coefficient of variation for the bioavailability was \nlow (CV-14.4%) compared to that of other commercial trans \nmucosal dosage forms, indicating unexpectedly very repro \nducible and efficient delivery. Absorption from the sublingual \nNanoTabR formulations is  fast  with an average T  of \napproximately 12 minutes, while the onset of delivery occurs \nwithin 7 minutes from administration. However, in contrast to \nIV administration, the formulation blunts the absorption \nmaximum by 2-3-fold compared to  IV.  In  addition,  the \nabsorption half-life is extended significantly (3.3-fold over \nIV) indicating a more Sustained absorption profile. \n\nAn important mathematical ratio that demonstrates the \nprolonged plateau phase of the measured blood plasma levels \nof Sufentanil following administration of the transmucosal \nbioadhesive formulations is  the Therapeutic Time Ratio, \nwhich is defined as the time spent above 50% of C, \nnor \nmalized by the known IV terminal elimination half-life of the \ndrug: \n\nThe Therapeutic Time Ratio of the sublingual sufentanil \nformulation of this example is 0.28 whereas the ratio for IV \nsufentanil is 0.05 (using the published IV elimination half-life \nof Sufentanil in dogs of 139 minutes). Therefore, the trans \nmucosal formulation (#44) resulted in a 5.6-fold increased \ntherapeutic time ratio compared to IV Sufentanil, indicating \nthat after delivery from a sublingual bioadhesive formulation \nof this invention, Sufentanilachieves and remains within effi \ncacious therapeutic levels for longer time compared to IV. \nThis example highlights some of the advantages of the Sub \nlingual  Sufentanil  formulations  of this  invention,  which \ninclude (i) efficient and reproducible delivery (ii) fast onset of \naction (iii) blunted C  of absorption and (iv) prolonged \nabsorption profile. These attributes Suggest that the transmu \ncosal  formulations  of the present  invention  can lead to \nimproved drug therapeutic benefit while minimizing side \neffects and improving the safety of drug administration. \n\nAnother study in Beagle dogs was performed to evaluate \nthe advantages of the Sublingual formulations over liquid \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n29 \nadministration sublingually. This study is described in detail \nin Example 8 (Table 14). The results (presented in Table 15 \nand FIG. 4) indicate that although sublingual delivery of \nSufentanil (5 Jug) via instillation from a liquid dosage form \nresults in rapid T., this  method of drug administration \nresults in very low absorption (F=40.0+32.5%) and very high \nvariability of absorption (83.1% CV) compared to the sublin \ngual sufentanil formulation of Example 7. This is probably \ndue to partial oral absorption of the drug following partial \nSwallowing of the instilled liquid. The C  is also highly \nvariable with this method of drug administration, exhibiting a \nhigh coefficient of variation of 72%. The Therapeutic Time \nRatio for the instilled liquid sufentanil was calculated as \n0.04+0.02, which is very similar to the IV sufentanil arm. \nTherefore, Sublingual instillation from a liquid does not pro \nvide the advantageous therapeutic plateau observed with the \nSublingual formulation. These findings demonstrate that the \nhigh sublingual bioavailability observed from the bioadhe \nsive formulations claimed in this application is not intrinsic to \nthe molecule but rather it is a direct result of the unique design \nof the dosage form and its formulation. The transmucosal \nformulation's strong adhesion to the Sublingual cavity mini \nmizes the variability in the surface area available for absorp \ntion, as is the case of a liquid solution, thus improving deliv \nery of the molecule to the systemic circulation. In addition, \nowing to its unique design and Small dimensions, the Nano \nTabR does not elicit significant saliva production, thus reduc \ning the potential for ingestion of the released drug. Both \nfactors  contribute to the higher and more uniform drug \nabsorption from the Sublingual cavity. \n\nIn another part of the same study (presented in Example 9), \nthe bioavailability of sufentanil following swallowing of the \nNanoTab(R) was determined in the same animal model. Since \nthere is little to no literature data on the GI sufentanil bio \navailability, it was important to evaluate the bioavailability of \nthis route of administration to further support the observation \nthat drug from the Sublingual administration of formulations \ncould not be swallowed and maintain a high bioavailability. \nAs indicated by the PKanalysis data in Table 15, oral absorp \ntion of sufentanil from the bioadhesive tablets results in very \nlow drug bioavailability (F=12.2+16.3%). The low absorp \ntion leads to high variability in PK, e.g., in the amount of drug \nabsorbed and the pharmacokinetics of absorption  (C, \nT) as shown in Table 15 (134.2% CV). The data further \ndemonstrate that absorption from the bioadhesive formula \ntion of Example #7 occurred almost exclusively via sublin \ngual rather than GI absorption in contrast to commercially \navailable opioid transmucosal dosage forms, in which a con \nsiderable amount of the drug is  delivered to the GI tract \n(ActiqR  75%: FentoraR)\u201450% oral  absorption).  These \nfindings Support the conclusion that the bioadhesive Sublin \ngual formulations of the current invention strongly adhere in \nthe Sublingual cavity in Such a manner that they don\u2019t dis \nlodge, thus avoiding oral ingestion and avoiding the high \nvariability of plasma levels which is typical when drug is \nabsorbed via the GI route. \n\nIn certain embodiments, the bioadhesive transmucosal for \nmulations of the present invention can be modified in order to \nmanipulate and control the pharmacokinetic profile. As an \nexample the formulations can be adjusted to achieve fast \ndisintegration and drug release and thus enable fast pharma \ncokinetic profiles that enable fast onset of action, while main \ntaining the other performance attributes of the tablet such as \nbioadhesion, reproducibility of action, blunted C, etc. \nSuch fast-disintegrating tablets may be engineered to disin \ntegrate from within 30 seconds up to 20 minutes and enable \npharmacokinetic profiles that can vary accordingly with dura \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n30 \ntion of action that can vary from 10 minutes to 1-2 hours. \nAlternatively, the formulations of the present invention can be \nadjusted to achieve intermediate erosion times (and erosion \nkinetic profiles) and drug release and thus enable intermedi \nate pharmacokinetic profiles that provide a more Sustained \naction. Although Such formulations may still provide a fast \nonset of action, they are mostly designed to enable the longer \nSustained effect while maintaining the other performance \nattributes of the tablet such as bioadhesion, reproducibility of \naction, blunted C, etc. Such intermediate-disintegrating \ntablets may be engineered to disintegrate from within 30 \nseconds up to 30 minutes and enable pharmacokinetic pro \nfiles that can vary accordingly. Finally, the formulations of the \npresent invention can be adjusted to achieve  slow disinte \ngration times (and erosion kinetic profiles) and slow drug \nrelease and thus enable very prolonged pharmacokinetic pro \nfiles that provide Sustained drug action. Although Such for \nmulations may be designed to still provide a fast onset, they \nare mostly intended to enable the sustained drug PK and \neffect while maintaining the other performance attributes of \nthe tablet  such as bioadhesion, reproducibility of action, \nblunted C, etc. Such slowly-disintegrating tablets may be \nengineered to disintegrate from within 15 minutes to up to 8 \nhours and enable pharmacokinetic profiles that can vary \naccordingly. \n\nIn addition, the pharmacokinetic profiles obtained from \nSuch bioadhesive Sublingual formulations may vary depend \ning on the dosage form design, geometry, compositions, etc. \nExamples of Such PK profiles include ascending plasma pro \nfiles, which resemblebell-shaped curves, profiles that exhibit \nmore than a single peak, prolonged seemingly flat PK profiles \nover the entire duration of action or intermediate profiles. Of \nparticular  interest  are  bi-phasic  absorption  profiles  that \nexhibit a fast release component followed by a slow, extended \nrelease phase. \n\nIt should be noted that the bioadhesive transmucosal for \nmulation described herein (whether the fast-, intermediate- or \nslow-disintegrating type) are neither effervescent nor do they \ndisintegrate to the individual carrier particles comprising the \ndosage form. \n\nTo demonstrate the ability of the bioadhesive transmucosal \nformulations of the present invention to enable such distinct \npharmacokinetic profiles, a number of formulations (#54 \n#58) were prepared in Example 10 representing both hydro \ngel- and eroding-type formulations. They were prepared with \nSufentanil citrate and designed to provide fast, intermediate \nand slow release of the drug from the dosage form. The \nformulations, which are described in Table 16, were prepared \nby direct compression, as described in Example 1, except for \nformulation #56, which was prepared by wet granulation, as \ndescribed in  Example 3 and were evaluated in a healthy \nconscious Beagle dog model, as described in Example 10 and \nTable 17. \nSufentanil Administration from Fast- and Medium-Disinte \ngrating Formulations (#55, 54). \n\nThe analytical results are shown in FIG.5 and the results of \nthe pharmacokinetic analysis are summarized in Table 18. \nTablets of formulation #55 disintegrated in <5 min following \nadministration, while tablets of formulation #54 disintegrated \nin <20 minutes. Formulation #54 exhibited a fast onset of \naction (T-7.1+0.5 min) and a relatively fast T  (as early \nas 10 minutes) following administration. In-spite of the fast \nonset of action, the formulation resulted in blunting of the \nC, albeit Smaller than the longer-acting formulation of \nExample 7 and a somewhat prolonged action, as indicated by \nthe longer plasma half-life (26.7+2.2 min) compared to IV. \nThe performance of this formulation mirrors that of Example, \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n31 \n7,  in  that  it  maintains  high  sufentanil  bioavailability \n(F=90.4+25.3% compared to IV) and low coefficient of varia \ntion (CV-28%) compared to other commercial transmucosal \ndosage forms. Finally, the TTR was increased 3-fold com \npared to IV, thereby confirming the very reproducible and \nefficient delivery enabled by the formulations of the present \ninvention over other dosage forms or formulation types. \n\nFormulation #54 exhibits a similarly fast (albeit slower \nthan Formulation #55) onset of action (T=9.2+4.3 min) \nand a relatively slower T  (25.0+8.7 min), while it enables \nincreased blunting of the C. In addition, it displays more \nprolonged action, as indicated by the longer plasma half-life \n(49.2+22 min) compared to IV. Still, the formulation exhibits \nhigh bioavailability (F-88.2+28.9%) of sufentanil and an \nenhanced therapeutic benefit as indicated by the almost 6-fold \nincrease of the TTR (0.28+0.13) compared to IV. \nSufentanil Administration from Slow-Disintegrating Formu \nlation (#58). \n\nThe  tablets  of this  formulation  disintegrated  slowly \nbetween 35 and 120 minutes following administration. This \nformulation  exhibited  a  very  slow  onset  of  action \n(T \n48.0-34.1 min) and Sustained Sufentanil pharmaco \nkinetics even after 8 hours post-administration (plasma half \nlife of 205-93.1 min). The prolonged PK resulted in signifi \ncant (almost 2.4-fold) blunting of the C  compared to IV \nand a very pronounced increase (almost 22.6-fold) of the TTR \n(range of 8.8-36.4). These examples serve to illustrate the \nability of the bioadhesive transmucosal formulations of the \npresent invention to modify and control the drug release and \npharmacokinetic action of the drug in vivo. \n\nTo further demonstrate the ability of the bioadhesive trans \nmucosal formulations of the present invention to modify and \ncontrol drug pharmacokinetics independent of the type of \ndrug and its physicochemical properties, a number of formu \nlations were prepared with two additional opioids, fentanyl \nand alfentanil. \n\nAs presented in Example 11, a number of formulations \n(#59-#62) were prepared (by direct compression) with fenta \nnyl citrate representing both hydrogel- and eroding-type, \ndesigned to achieve intermediate and slow release of the drug. \nThey were evaluated in a healthy conscious Beagle dog \nmodel, as described in Table 21. The results of the PKanalysis \nare summarized in Table 22 and the analytical results are \nillustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8. \nFentanyl Administration from Medium-Disintegrating For \nmulations (#59, 60). \n\nTablets of formulation #59 disintegrated between 20 and \n50 min, similarly with those of formulation #60 which disin \ntegrated within 20 min following administration. Both for \nmulations exhibited a relatively fast onset of action (16.2+6.8 \nand 9.0+2.6 min, respectively) and blunted the blunted the \nC, albeit to a different extent each: 2.4-fold for formula \ntion #59 and 6.7-fold for formulation #60. Further, they \nachieved high drug bioavailability (around 95% compared to \nIV) and low variability of absorption (8.4 and 10.5% for \nformulations #59 and #60, respectively) compared to other \ncommercial transmucosal dosage forms. In addition, both \npreparations significantly prolonged the drug PK. Formula \ntion #59 exhibited a more pronounced absorption peak and \nexhibited a plasma half-life of 75.5+32.5 minutes (7.5-fold \nprolongation over IV). In contrast, formulation #60 exhibited \na more prolonged absorption profile, as shown by the 12.1- \nfold extension of its plasma half life (121.5+19.1 minutes). \nThis prolongation of action was also reflected in the increased \nTTR which increased by 6-fold for formulation #59 to 11.5- \nfold for formulation #60. This data confirms that fentanyl \nabsorption via the bioadhesive transmucosal formulations of \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n32 \nthis invention results in very reproducible and efficient deliv \nery over other dosage forms or formulation types (efferves \ncent, etc). \nFentanyl Administration from Slow-Disintegrating Formula \ntion (#62). \n\nTablets  of the  slowly-disintegrating  formulation  #62 \neroded slower that the medium-disintegrating ones; erosion \nwas completed between 35 and 65 minutes. In contrast to the \nmedium-disintegrating formulations, the slow formulation \nexhibited a delayed onset of action (43.6+20.7 min), albeit \nmaintained a very high bioavailability (F=99.0+4.4%) and \nvery low variability (CV-4.5%) compared to other commer \ncial transmucosal dosage forms. This formulation provides an \neven more prolonged absorption offentanyl compared to the \nintermediate-disintegrating formulations: the plasma half \nlife is extended to 154.4+52.6 minutes, representing a very \nprolonged drug absorption profile-a nearly 15.5-fold exten \nsion for the duration of action compared to IV. This is also \nreflected in the nearly 4-fold reduction of the C  compared \nto IV. Finally, the Therapeutic Time Ratio is also increased \ncompared to  IV to  0.46+0.12, representing an  11.5-fold \nincrease. \n\nIn addition, as shown in Example 12, a bioadhesive trans \nmucosal formulation (#63) was prepared with alfentanil \n(Table 23) and was evaluated in a healthy conscious Beagle \ndog model, as described in Table 24. The results of the phar \nmacokinetic analysis are summarized in Table 25 and the PK \nanalysis results are illustrated in FIG. 9. \n\nDisintegration of both tablets of formulation #63 occurred \nwithin 20 minutes from administration. Alfentanil adminis \ntration from the bioadhesive formulation resulted in a high \nbioavailability of 94% compared to IV alfentanil and a coef \nficient of variation of 15% for the bioavailability, 7% for C. \nand 28% for T. The onset of alfentanil absorption from this \nformulation was fast, occurring within 5 minutes from admin \nistration. The formulation blunted the absorption peak by \nalmost 4-fold. Overall, the formulation enabled a sustained \nabsorption profile of the drug, as indicated by the 8-to-10-fold \nincreased plasma half-life (40.8 vs. 4.4 minutes). The TTR \nwas calculated to be 0.33, compared to 0.04 for the IV alfen \ntanil arm of this study (calculated using a published IV elimi \nnation half-life of 104 min for alfentanil in dogs). Therefore, \nthe alfentanil transmucosal  formulation (as  described  in \nExample 12) produces an 8-fold improved TTR over the IV \nalfentanil arm. The high bioavailability of this formulation \nagain Supports the claim that minimal Swallowing of drug \noccurs with use of a NanoTab(R). \n\nThese examples illustrate the highly efficacious delivery of \na number of molecules from the bioadhesive transmucosal \nformulations, which enabled high drug bioavailability with \nlow variability for all three drugs examined. The overall drug \nefficacy is also portrayed in the enhanced Therapeutic Time \nRatio indicating that after delivery from a sublingual formu \nlation of the present invention, the drug achieves and remains \nwithin efficacious therapeutic levels longer than intravenous \nadministration. In addition, the above data Support the claim \nof the transmucosal bioadhesive formulations of the present \ninvention are capable of controlling the drug release and \nenable a number of modified pharmacokinetic profiles, rang \ning from fast, intermediate, to slow drug absorption. \nIn Vivo Pharmacokinetics\u2014Human Clinical Study \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Sufentanil following Sublingual \nadministration of selected bioadhesive formulations (#46, \n#47 and #48 described in Table 9) were evaluated in a cross \nover clinical study, which is described in detail in Example \n13, involving healthy, naltrexone-blocked human volunteers. \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n15 \n\n10 \n\n25 \n\n33 \nThe transmucosal formulations eroded over a period of \n10-30 minutes in all subjects. In addition, there was only one \nincident of tablet dislodgment from the point of administra \ntion out of a total of 72 tablet administrations, indicating \nstrong bioadhesion of the tablet to the sublingual cavity. Sub-  5 \nlingual sufentanil administration from the bioadhesive for \nmulations results in a remarkably consistent pharmacokinetic \nprofile as illustrated in FIG. 10 and summarized in Table 26. \nThe bioavailability compared to IV (for single administra \ntion) of all three dosages averaged 91%, which is far superior \nto that measured for commercially available fentanyl trans \nmucosal preparations, Actiq and Fentora (47% and 65%, \nrespectively\u2014Fentora package insert). Although the attain \nment of high bioavailability could be due to a number of \nfactors, it can be largely attributed to the reduced (if any) \nSwallowing of the drug owing to both (i) the strong tablet \nbioadhesion to the sublingual mucosa that did not allow its \ndislodgment and Subsequent Swallowing, but also (ii) the lack \nof increased saliva production due to the small size of the \ndosage form. In contrast to these findings, both commercial \nproducts of Fentora and Actiq (as stated in their package \ninserts) claim at least 50% and 75% of the drug dose, respec \ntively, is Swallowed via salivaingestion, thus leading to lower \nbioavailability than the formulations of the present invention. \nThis  finding  mirrors  the  results  of the  animal  studies \ndescribed in Examples 7-12, which indicate very high bio \navailability for the transmucosal formulations of this inven \ntion. All studies presented in this invention Support the con \nclusion  that  greater than  75% of the  drug is  absorbed \ntransmucosally. Therefore, less than 25% of the drug is swal \nlowed, which is a much lower to that reported by the afore \nmentioned commercial products. \n\n40 \n\n35 \n\nImportantly, this high bioavailability is also linked to high \nreproducibility of delivery, as indicated by the low coeffi \ncients of variation for bioavailability of 24.7-34.1% for the \nthree formulations evaluated compared to 20.1% for IV. This \nis much lower than that reported for Fentora (CV-45%) and \nActiq (CV-41%) (Fentora package insert). Therefore the \ntotal dose delivered to the patient/subject is not only more \nbioavailable for the sufentanil formulations of this invention \nbut it is more consistently the same from patient to patient. \nAlthough, as described above, this may be due to a number of \nfactors, this is largely due to (i) the strong bioadhesion of the \ntransmucosal dosage form in all patients, thereby reducing \nmovement of the tablet and thereby decreasing variability of 45 \nabsorption and (ii) the reduced Swallowing of the drug. \n\nThe Sufentanil Sublingual formulations are also Superior in \nterms of consistent drug plasma levels early after administra \ntion. The C  obtained with formulation #48 was 27.5+7.7 \npg/ml with a CV of only 28%. In contrast, the Fentora and 50 \nActiq C. \n41-56% and 33%, respectively (Fentora package insert). \n\nsuffers from increased variability with CVs of \n\nIn addition to Superior bioavailability and consistency in \nplasma concentrations, the T  is a very important param \neter due to the requirement for quick and consistent onset of 55 \npain relief is important in the treatment of acute pain. The \nT  for the transmucosal formulation #48 was 40.8+13.2 \nminutes (range 19.8-60 minutes) which is superior to the \nreported average T  for Fentora (46.8 min with a range of \n20-240 min) and Actiq (90.8 min, range 35-240 min) (Fentora  60 \npackage insert). Therefore the bioadhesive transmucosal for \nmulations of this invention offer markedly improved onset \nand consistency in the onset of analgesia over Fentora and \nActiq, with a 400% decrease in the slowest onset of T. \n\nImportant in the treatment of acute pain, especially acute  65 \n\nbreakthrough pain, is a consistent and relatively short half \nlife of the drug. The plasma elimination half-life of the 10 ug \n\n30 \n\n34 \nSufentanil NanoTab(R) was 1.71+0.4 hours, which allows the \ndrug to be titratable for various levels of pain. If the break \nthrough pain event lasts longer than 1.5 hours then the patient \ncan dose with another NanoTabR. The half-life of Actiq and \nFentora are 3.2 hours and 2.63 hours, respectively, for the \nlowest doses. The half-lives for the higher doses increase \nsubstantially for these drugs, thereby limiting the titratability \nof these drugs. \n\nAnother aspect of the PK curves generated by sublingual \nSufentanil formulations tested in the human studies is the \nplateau phase, which allows for a period of consistent plasma \nlevels, which is important for both safety and efficacy. Com \npared to either IV bolus administration (see Animal Studies \nExamples 7-12) or the 10 minute IV infusion in the human \nstudy (Example 13), the PK profile for the sufentanil formu \nlations is clearly safer, as they result in blunting of the C. \nplasma levels. Given the ability of opioids to produce respi \nratory depression, avoiding these high peaks in the PK profile \nis advantageous. \n\nThe time spent above 50% of C. \n\non average for the 12 \nVolunteers for the 2.5, 5 and 10 ug dosage strengths was 110, \n111 and 106 minutes, respectively, resulting in TTRs (for all \nthe sufentanil formulations evaluated in the clinical study) \nthat ranged from 0.72-0.75. These values are well in agree \nment with those obtained in the animal studies with Sufentanil \nformulations (0.14-1.13). As the transmucosal formulation is \nmodified to enable shorter or longer disintegration times, the \nTherapeutic Time Ratio may be modified from approximately \n0.2-2.0 for sufentanil in humans. \n\nIn addition, the Therapeutic Time Ratio is a measure of \nhow Successfully short-acting drugs are formulated to pro \nduce an increase in therapeutic time and increase safety by \navoiding  high  peak  plasma  C  concentrations.  For \nexample, as a comparison, the Sufentanil IV arm of the human \nstudy demonstrated a Therapeutic Time Ratio of 0.067. This \nlow ratio value for the IV arm, therefore, is a measure of the \nhigh peak produced by IV infusion of Sufentanil and demon \nstrates that this formulation does not produce a significant \nplateau phase. In contrast, the bioadhesive transmucosal for \nmulations  evaluated  in  the  clinical  study  demonstrated \n10-fold higher Therapeutic Time Ratios versus IV, thereby \nSupporting a prolonged therapeutic plateau profile for these \nformulations. \n\nIn Summary, the data from both the clinical and animal \nstudies clearly demonstrate the advantages of the bioadhesive \ntransmucosal formulations  of the present invention  over \nintravenous delivery and delivery from commercially avail \nable  product  based  on  conventional  technologies.  The \nexamples provided herein provide compelling data that dem \nonstrate (i) efficient and reproducible delivery (ii) fast onset \nof action (iii) blunted C  of absorption and (iv) prolonged \nabsorption profile. These attributes suggest that the bioadhe \nsive  formulations  of the  present  invention  can  lead  to \nimproved drug therapeutic benefit while minimizing side \neffects and improving the safety of drug administration. \nIn Vitro Formulation Characterization \n\nIn Vitro Bioadhesion Force \nAs illustrated in Example 5, the transmucosal formulations \nof the present invention can be engineered to demonstrate \nvarying degrees of bioadhesion. In the exemplary formula \ntions of that example, the transmucosal formulations exhib \nited attachment forces to the porcine mucosa Substrate that \nvaried between 0.03 to 0.18 N/cm. The determined forces of \nattachment correlate directly to the magnitude of the force of \nadhesion in  vivo. It  is important to note that the specific \nexperimental conditions (such as contact time, rinsing, etc) \nare expected to significantly influence the recorded detach \n\n\f35 \nment force; for example increased contact time will lead to \nincreased interaction and thereby increased force of adhe \nsion. For the determinations the 2 minutes of contact time \nwere selected to reflect the contact time of a fast-disintegrat \ning formulation. \n\nThe results  summarized in  Table  11  indicate  that  the \nstrength of adhesion of the selected transmucosal formula \ntions of Example 5 varied over a 6-fold range. However, the \nformulations  of this  invention  are  expected  to  exhibit \nstrengths of adhesion that can extend well beyond this experi \nmentally determined range. It is anticipated that the strength \nof bioadhesion of the formulations presented in this invention \ncan be modified over the range of 0.005-1.0 N/cm (500-10 \ndyn/cm). \nIn Vitro Drug Dissolution Kinetics \n\nSufentanil citrate dissolution from formulations #46-#48 \n(FIG. 2) follows diffusion-type kinetics according to Higu \nchi\u2019s law. This type of release is the signature of hydrogel \ntype systems. In addition, the data is described well by the \nKorsmeyer & Peppas equation (Korsmeyer, R. W., Gurney, \nR. Doecker, E., Buri, P., Peppas, N.A., Mechanisms of solute \nrelease from hydrophilic polymers, J. Pharm. Sci. 15:25-35, \n1983), with R values between 0.96-0.98. Fitting of the dis \nSolution curve indicated that drug release from all three sys \ntems was independent of the amount of drug loaded and that \nthe exponent in returned fitted values of 0.566+0.109 (0.068% \nw/w sufentanil citrate tablet),  0.673+0.123 (0.163% w/w \nsufentanil  citrate  tablet)  and 0.446+0.116  (0.273% w/w \nsufentanil citrate  tablet).  It  is  noted that all  values of n \napproach 0.5, which indicates Fickian diffusion-controlled \nrelease which is somewhat influenced by the swelling of the \ntablet, further corroborating the hydrogel-type release from \nthese formulations. \n\nAs also  demonstrated  in  vivo  (Examples 7-12),  it  is \nexpected that the formulations of this invention can exhibit a \nrange of dissolution profiles that may extend from a few \nminutes (2-4 min) to over several hours (6-8). In addition, \ndepending on the drug physicochemical properties, the for \nmulation composition and tablet design (such as physical \ndimensions, presence of coatings, number of coating layers, \netc),  the obtained in  vitro  drug dissolution profiles  may \nexhibit a number of dissolution kinetics, such as first or sec \nond order, diffusion or erosion-based or following a mixed \nerosion-diffusion mechanism. \n\nDissolution testing of the colored dye (a surrogate for the \nactive drug) from various formulations was performed in \ndistilled water, using USP Apparatus 1 (Distek Technologies) \nand analyzed by UV-Vis detection at 590 nm for bromocresol \nblue. Each tablet was placed in 100 \nbasket which were \nthen placed in 100-mL glass dissolution vessels containing 5 \nmL of dissolution media, thermostated at 37+0.5\u00b0C. Samples \nwere pulled at selected intervals and analyzed using an Agi \nlent 8453 UV-Vis spectrophotometer using a 1 cm-pathlength \nflow-through cell with Agilent 1 FS sipper system. The in \nvitro dissolution of the dye for the NanoTabs was evaluated \nwith selected formulations. The results are presented in FIG. \n11. \nEffect of Effect of pH on Sufentanil Formulation Dissolution \nIn Vitro. \n\nSufentanil  dissolution kinetics  from formulation  HA34 \nloaded with 80  g of Sufentanil base was determined in a \nType II  USP dissolution  apparatus suitably  modified to \naccommodate a small Volume NanoTabR containing a small \namount of sufentanil.  Drug release from the bioadhesive \ntransmucosal formulations were monitored by LC/MS. The \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\nUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n36 \nresults are shown in FIG. 11 and denote the similarity of the \ndissolution kinetics of sufentanil from the dosage form within \nthe pH ranges examined. \nHardness \n\nDosage form hardness can be determined by any pharma \nceutical-grade tablet hardness equipment, such as the Vankel \nVK-200 Hardness Tester (manufactured by Varian Inc., Cary, \nN.C.). The hardness of a given dosage form typically corre \nlates with dosage form disintegration and may range from 0.1 \nto 50 kiloponds (+1% full scale). In general, for hardness \ntesting, the dosage form is placed between the  jaws\u2019 of a \nhardness tester. The moving jaw moves toward the stationary \njaw until the dosage form is crushed and the dosage form \ncrushing force is measured by the apparatus. Exemplary hard \nness measurements for a dosage form of the invention, range \nfrom about 4 to about 25 Newtons, as illustrated by the hard \nness values for a number of formulations shown in Table 1B. \n\nTABLE 1B \n\nHardness values for a number of bioadhesive drug formulations. \n\nFormulation \ni \n\nHardness \n(N) \n\nWeight \n(mg) \n\nBioadhesion \n(Mean \nDetachment force) \n(N/cm2) \n\nO.139  O.O61 \nO.066  O.OO7 \nO.158  0.009 \nO.1260.042 \n\nO.O86  O.O41 \n\nO.097 -  O.O41 \nO.O92  O.O39 \n\n5.7 \nS.1 \nS.6 \nS.6 \n6 \n6.2 \n6.1 \n6.2 \n6.1 \n6.4 \n5.8 \nS.61 \nS.62 \n\n5.5 \n5.5 \nS.63 \n5.4 \n5.9 \n5.8 \n5.8 \nS.61 \n5.85 \n\n569 \n\nA13 \nA14 \nA15 \nA16 \nA17 \nA18 \nA19 \nA20 \nA21 \nA22 \nA23 \nA24 \nA25 \nA26 \nA27 \nA28 \nA29 \nA3O \nA31 \nA32 \nA33 \nA34 \nA3S \nAS4 \nASS \nA56 \nA57 \nAS8 \nAS9 \nA60 \nA61 \nA62 \nA63 \nA64 \nA65 \nA66 \nA67 \nA68 \nA69 \n\n0.7 \n5.3 \n8.9 \n8.9 \n2.2 \n9.6 \n1.6 \n2.6 \n4 \n4 \n1.6 \n9.5 \nO.2 \n1 \n7.5 \nO.8 \n8.5 \n5 \n8.1 \n1.6 \n0.7 \n3.2 \n10-13 \n6.9  O.7 \n9.8 -  1.3 \n12.23.2 \n6.92.8 \n10.5 -  18 \n7.71.7 \n13.21.O \n113 -  1.3 \n12.20.9 \n15.3 -  0.9 \n14.9 -  1.1 \n10.6 -  1.0 \n14.7  1.2 \n12.4 + 1.0 \n12.4 + 1.0 \n13.3  1.6 \n\nSingle and Multiple Dose Applicators \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\nThe invention provides disposable applicators for deliver \ning dosage forms comprising a formulation of the invention to \nthe oral mucosa of a patient Such that application to a pre \ndetermined location for drug delivery (e.g. the mouth, Sub \nlingual space, etc.) is effected. \n\nIn one approach to the invention, a dosage form, may be \ndelivered to the oral mucosa, using a single dose applicator. \nThe dosage form is provided in a child-resistant drug dispens \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n37 \ning device or packaging and delivered to the oral mucosa, for \nexample, the Sublingual cavity. Alternatively, the dosage form \nis administered with assistance with or without a device. \n\nIn one embodiment, a single dose applicator (SDA) is used \nto administer variety of drug dosage forms, including a solid \ntablet, a liquid capsule, a gel capsule, a liquid, agel, a powder, \na film, a strip, a ribbon, a spray, a mist, a patch, or any other \nSuitable drug dosage form. \n\nThe single dose applicator (SDA) may contain the dosage \nform within, may have the drug dosage form attached or \naffixed to it, may have the dosage form dissolved in it, and \nmay afford a seal against moisture, humidity, and light. The \nsingle dose applicator may be manually manipulated by a \npatient, healthcare provider, or other user to place the dosage \nform in the proper location for drug delivery. \n\nIn practicing the invention, a single- or multiple-dose \napplicator or drug dispensing device may be used to deliver \ntablets or other dosage forms into the hand, the mouth, under \nthe tongue, or to other locations appropriate for specific drug \ndelivery needs. \n\nIn one embodiment, a single- or multiple-dose applicator \nor drug dispensing device is used to deliver a dosage form to \nthe oral mucosa, e.g., the Sublingual space. \n\nThe dosage forms inside the dispensing device remain dry \nprior to dispensing, at which point a single dosage form is \ndispensed from the device into the mouth, e.g., the Sublingual \nspace, wherein a patient\u2019s saliva will wet the tablet and allow \nfor tablet disintegration/erosion and drug dissolution. \n\nThe SDA may be provided as a pair of forceps, a Syringe, a \nStick or rod, a straw, a dropper, a sprayer or atomizer, or any \notherform suitable for the application of a single drug dosage \nform. After use, the SDA may be disposed of, so as to elimi \nnate the risk of contaminating the drug dispensing device with \nsaliva, or other contaminants. \n\nFor Sublingual administration, a small Volume dosage form \nmay be administered Sublingually by placement under the \ntongue, adjacent to the frenulum using forceps. Alternatively, \na small Volume dosage form may be administered Sublin \ngually by placement under the tongue, adjacent to the frenu \nlum using a Syringe, a stick or rod, a straw, a dropper, or any \notherform suitable for the application of a single drug dosage \nform, including but not limited to a SDA, as further described \nherein. \n\nThe dosage forms may be provided in a package that con \nsists  of molded plastic or laminate that has indentations \n(\u201cblisters\u2019) into which a dosage form, is placed, referred to \nherein as a \u201cblister pack\u201d. A cover, typically a laminated \nmaterial or foil, is used to seal to the molded part. A blister \npack may or may not have pre-formed or molded parts. \n\nIn one embodiment, the blister pack has two flexible layers \nthat are sealed with the dosage form in between and the \nprimary unit dose blister packalso serves as an applicator for \ndelivering a single dosage form to the Sublingual space, once \nthe child-resistant foil is peeled back. \n\nIn yet another embodiment of the invention, a long tape or \narray of dosage forms sealed between a flexible blister layer \nand a foil or otherwise breakable layer is provided. A pushrod \nis positioned above a dosage form, and upon actuation pushes \nagainst the blister, forcing the dosage form through the foil or \nbreakable layer, dispensing the dosage form. \n\nSuch blister packs may be provided in a child resistant \n\nmultiple dosage drug dispensing device. \n\nFIGS. 15A-C, FIGS. 16A-F, FIGS. 18A-C and FIGS. 19A \nand B are schematic depictions of exemplary embodiments of \na SDA of the invention. \n\nIn one approach, the present invention provides disposable \nsingle dose applicators comprising ablister pack 151, which \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n38 \ncontains drug dosage forms 67 inside a housing and a handle \n131, wherein a backing, such as a foil seal 135 covers the \ndosage form 67 and the handle 131, as shown for example in \nFIGS. 16B and 16D. \n\nIn one embodiment, the disposable single dose applicator, \nthe combination of housing or tube 129 and handle 131 has \nthe shape of a spoon. \n\nThe housing or tube 129 for the dosage form 67 is ablister \npack 151 that accommodates a unit dose of a dosage form 67 \nfor administration to a subject. The dosage form 67 is sealed \nin the blister pack 151 by a foil or other type of seal 135. \n\nIn some embodiments, the foil or other type of seal 135 is \nremoved prior to administration of the dosage form 67 and the \nhandle 131 is used to place the dosage form 67 in the appro \npriate location against the oral mucosa of the Subject such that \nthe dosage form 67 adheres to the oral mucosa. See, e.g., \nFIGS. 16B, 16D, 16E and 16F. In other embodiments, the foil \nor other type of seal 135 is perforated and removed prior to \nadministration of the dosage form 67 by folding the applica \ntor 123 at the perforation 149 prior to administration where \nthe handle 131 is used to place the dosage form 67 in the \nappropriate location against the oral mucosa of a subject. See, \ne.g., FIGS. 19A and B. This permits the handling of only a \nsingle drug dosage form 67 at a time and prevents the other \nindividually sealed drug dosage forms 67 from becoming \nexposed to Saliva, humidity and the like. \n\nThe foil or other type of seal 135 of a disposable applicator \n123 including handle 131 is typically made of a single piece \nof foil laminate, paper, plastic or other covering, i.e. an appli \ncator tab 147 that spans the back of the housing or tube 129 \nalone or both the housing or tube 129 and the handle 131, \neffectively seals the dosage form 67 in a blister pack 151 or \nother container. \n\nThe handle 131 enables proper placement of the dosage \n\nA plurality of single dose applicators may be provided as a \nseries of individual single dose applicators attached by the \nbacking or housed in multiple dose dispenser 137. \n\nIn another embodiment, a dispensing device 11 comprises \na package 141 that holds a single or multiple drug dosage \nforms, a distal orifice for delivery of the drug dosage form, \nand an internal mechanism that segregates and releases the \ndosage forms. See, e.g., FIG. 17. The dispensing device is \ntypically handheld and may comprise some or all of the \nfeatures set forth above for a device used to dispense non \npackaged dosage forms. \n\nFIGS. 14A and 14B show one embodiment of a single dose \napplicator 123 a dispensing device for delivering drug dosage \nforms. The dispensing device shown in FIG. 14A depicts the \nsingle dose applicator 123 that is ready to dispense a drug \ndosage form 67. In one aspect of this embodiment, a user \npinches the single dose applicator 125 which opens the appli \ncator and a drug dosage form 67 is dispensed as shown in FIG. \n14B. \n\nFIGS. 15A-C show an embodiment of a single dose appli \ncator 123 that is comprised of a applicator shaped as a tube \n129, a stopper seal 127, a handle 131 (e.g., an ergonomic \nhandle), and a single dosage form 67. FIG. 15A shows the \nsingle dose applicator 123 in its sealed configuration, prior to \nuse. FIG. 15B shows the single dose applicator 123 with its \nstopper seal 127 removed, forming an opening 133, and ready \nfor use. FIG. 15C shows the single dose applicator 123 tilted \nSo as to dispense the dosage form 67 on the oral mucosa, e.g., \nin the Sublingual space. \n\n35 \n\nform 67 without touching the dosage form 67. \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n39 \nFIGS. 16A-F show several alternate embodiments of the \nsingle dose applicator 123. In all of these figures the applica \ntor seal 127 is broken and the applicator is tilted so as to drop \nthe drug dosage form 67 adjacent an oral mucosal membrane \nin the mouth of a Subject, e.g., under the tongue for Sublingual \ndosage form placement. FIG. 16A shows a tube like applica \ntor 129 with a handle 131 located axially under the tube 129. \nFIG. 16B shows an applicator formed as a thermoform or \nblister package 151 with a foil seal 135 that is peeled so as to \nopen the applicator package 141 prior to placing the dosage \nform 67. FIG. 16C shows an applicator that is a tube 129 \nwhich is broken to break the seal prior to dosage form 67 \nplacement. FIG. 16D shows a blister pack tube 151 type \ndosage form package 141 with a handle 131 such that after the \nseal 135 is peeled back the blister pack 151 can be held and \ntilted to place the drug dosage form 67, on an oral mucosal \nmembrane. FIGS. 16E and 16F show blister pack 151 type \npackaging with a handle 131 shaped like a flower or an \nanimal, respectively, to be used for single dose applicator 123 \ndesigned for pediatric  use.  Other single dose applicator \nshapes could include cartoon characters, animals, Super-he \nroes or other appropriate shapes for pediatric applications. \n\nFIG. 18A shows a flat rigid applicator 123 with a dosage \nform 67 adhered to one end, for example, by means of a \nrapidly  dissolving ingestible adhesive material Such that \nwhen the applicator end with the dosage form is placed under \nthe tongue, the adhesive dissolves, the dosage form 67 is \nplaced on an oral mucosal membrane, such as in the Sublin \ngual space, and the applicator can be removed. FIG. 18B \nshows an applicator 123 made from a water permeable mate \nrial, impregnated with drug, forming a material and dosage \nfrom matrix. When the impregnated end of this applicator 123 \nis placed under in the mouth on an oral mucosal membrane, \nthe moisture in the saliva dissolves the drug and delivers it \ntransmucosally.  FIG.  18C shows dissolving film  dosage \nforms 145 and a dosage form package with a plurality of \ndissolving film dosage forms 143 within it. The dissolving \nfilm dosage form 143 is removed from the package 141 and \nplaced on an oral mucosal membrane, e.g., in the Sublingual \nspace where it dissolves and delivers the drug transmucosally. \nFIGS. 19A-B provides an illustrations of two stages of use \nof one embodiment of a single dose applicator 123. FIG. 19A \nshows the applicator 123 in its configuration prior to use, with \ntwo applicator tabs 147, two perforations 149, and a blister \npack 151 containing a dosage form 67. In order to administer \nthe dosage form 67, the two applicator tabs 147 are bent \ndownward at the perforations 149, forming a handle 131, and \nthe seal 135 is peeled back to reveal the blister pack 151 and \nallow the dosage form 67 to be dropped on an oral mucosal \nmembrane, e.g., in the Sublingual space. \n\nIn another embodiment, a drug dispensing device of the \ninvention may contain a plurality of SDA's, in a cartridge or \nindividually packaged, and may dispense a single SDA con \ntaining a single drug dosage form for use by the patient, \nhealthcare provider, or user. The drug dispensing device may \ndispense single SDA's in the same way and with the same \nfeatures as would be advantageous for the dispensing of \nsingle drug dosage forms described in the invention. \n\nIn yet another embodiment the multiple dose applicator \n137 is a device which comprises one or more drug dosage \nforms 67 or single dose applicators 123, a portable power \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n40 \nmeans, like a battery, a printed circuit board, a data connec \ntivity means, and a user interface. In this embodiment the \ndrug dispensing device may include the ability to perform one \nor more of the following functions: record drug dosage dis \npensing history, check user identification by means offinger \nprint identification, RFID, voice recognition, etc., allow the \ndosage history to be transferred to another device, computer \nor network, and/or provide a lockout period between dose \ndispenses. \n\nFIG. 17 is a schematic depiction of an exemplary multiple \ndose applicator 137 for delivering dispensing drug dosage \nforms 67, each individually packaged in a single dose appli \ncator 123. \n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides drug formulations \nhaving a hardness of from about 4 to about 24 Newtons which \ncan be administered to a patient using a device. Exemplary \nhardness values for formulations of the invention are shown \nin FIGS. 12 and 13. Sufficient hardness for delivery using a \ndevice is particularly relevant to fragile dosage forms, such as \nsmall volume tablets or NanoTabs(R). \n\nAll publications referred to herein are incorporated herein \nby reference in their entirety for the purpose of describing and \ndisclosing the compositions and methodologies which are \ndescribed in the publications which might be used in connec \ntion with the presently described invention.

In a typical preparation, a full \nwet granulation was employed. In such a process, the alumi \nnum lake dye (acting as the drug Surrogate) was dissolved in \nthe appropriate diluent (water, EtOH or hydroalcoholic mix \ntures of a number of ratios) and was added either via direct \npouring or by spraying onto the dry blend of the remaining \nexcipients. The wet mix was then mixed in a high-shear mixer \nand processed to form granules of the desired size, in a high \nshear granulator (such as the KG-5). The formed granules \nwere then dried in a tray oven and mixed. The final mix was \nfed to a Piccola rotary press (or a beta press) equipped with \nthe specially designed load cell to enable the preparation of \ndosage forms. To achieve that approximately 5.5-8.0 mg of \nthe dried granules were compressed at 1-20 KN. For some of \nthe examples below additional excipients, such as the binder \nor the bioadhesive, were included in the solution that was \npoured over the dry blend of excipients. \n\nFurther, a number of different grades and particle sizes of \nmannitol can be employed to help optimize the granulation \nprocess. In the examples provided below, the mannitol grades \nwere varied (Pearlitol 100SD, Pearlitol 200SD or Pearlitol \n160C) obtain different quality granules (size, distribution, \netc.). \n\nAs is well-known to those skilled in the art, there is a \nnumber of process alterations that could be used in this pro \ncess. In one such alteration, a partial wet granulation was \nemployed to prepare dosage forms. In this process only a \nportion of the excipients was used in the formation of the \ngranules (intra-granular mix). In such process, the remaining \nexcipients were added extra-granularly to the granules and \nthe mix would be blended for a few minutes in order to create \na homogeneous matrix. The formulation examples given \nbelow (Table 8) also reflect partial granulation process. \n\nTABLE 7 \n\nExemplary Eroding & Hydrogel Formulations Prepared By Full Wet Granulation \n\nFormulation Type \n\nEroding \n\nHydrogel \n\nHydrogel \n\nHydrogel \n\nHydrogel \n\nFormulation # \nPourispray solution \n\nGranulation \nExcipient \nFDC Green (dye) \nMannitol (Pearlitol \nOOSD) \nMannitol (Pearlitol \n200SD) \nMannitol (Pearlitol \n60C) \nPEG 8OOO \nPVP K90 \nCarbopol 974 \nPolyox 303 \nLutrol F68 \nStearic Acid \nMgStearate \n\n#32 \nDye \nsolution \nLow Shear \n\n#33 \nDye + binder \nSolution \nLow shear \n\nO.O7 \n60.10 \n\nO.O7 \nS8.00 \n\n#34 \nWater \n\n#35 \nWater \n\nHigh Shear \nComposition, % wiw \n\nHigh Shear \n\nO.O7 \n\n0.07 \n\n#36 \nWater \n\nHigh Shear \n\nO.O7 \n\nS8.00 \n\nS8.OO \n\n28.83 \n\n1O.OO \n\n1.OO \n\n28.93 \n\nS.OO \n2.OO \nS.OO \n1.OO \n\n23.93 \nS.OO \n\nS.OO \n2.00 \nS.OO \n1.00 \n\n23.93 \nS.OO \n\nS.OO \n2.00 \nS.OO \n1.OO \n\n73.93 \n\n1S.OO \n\n3.00 \n2.OO \nS.OO \n1.OO \n\nTotal \n\n1OOOO \n\n100.00 \n\n100.00 \n\n1OO.OO \n\n1OOOO \n\n\fExcipient \n\nFDC Green \n(dye) \nMannitol \n(Pearlitol \n100SD) \nMannitol \n(Pearlitol \n200SD) \nPEG 8000 \nMicro- \ncrystalline \nCellulose \n(MCC-Emcel \n90M) \nPolyox 303 \nLutrol F68 \nStearic Acid \nMgStearate \n\n45 \nTABLE 8 \n\nExemplary Hydrogel Formulations Prepared \nBy Partial Wet Granulation \n\nFormulation # \n\n#37 \n\n#38 \n\n#39 \n\ni40 \n\nComposition, % wiw \n\nhiz1 \n\n#42 \n\nO.OS \n\nO.OS \n\nO.OS \n\nO.OS \n\nO.OS \n\nO.OS \n\n73.95 \n\n68.96 \n\n73.95 \n\n73.6 \n\n75.45 \n\n73.95 \n\n15 \n\n1S.OO \n\n1S.OO \n\n1S.OO \n\n2O.OO \n\n14.93 \n7:44 \n\nUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n46 \nTABLE 10 \n\nExemplary Placebo Formulations for Evaluations In Vitro. \n\nFormulation # \n\nComposition \n\nAluminum \nLake Dye \nMannitol \nCarbopol 971 \nPEG 8000 \nHPMC \nDibasic \nCalcium \nPhosphate \nPolyox 303 \nLutrol F68 \nStearic Acid \nMgStearate \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n49 \n\n50 \n\n51 \n\n47 \n\n52 \n\n53 \n\nComposition, % wiw \n\nO.14 \n\nO.14 \n\nO.14 \n\nO.14 \n\nO.14 \n\nO.14 \n\n83.87 \n\n68.87 \n\nS.OO \n1O.OO \n\nS.OO \n2O.OO \n\n56.87 \n7.00 \n35.00 \n\n73.86 \n\n1S.OO \n\nS1.9 \n2O.OO \n1S.OO \n\n40.7 \n2O.OO \n25.60 \n1O.OO \n\n1.00 \n\nS.OO \n1.OO \n\n1.00 \n\n3.00 \n2.OO \nS.OO \n1.OO \n\n7.OO \nS.OO \n1.OO \n\n2.60 \n\n1.00 \n\nTotal \n\n1OOOO  100.OO \n\n100.OO \n\n100.OO \n\n100.OO \n\n100.00 \n\n3 \n2 \n5 \n1.00 \n\n2.99 \n\n1.OO \n\n1...SO \n2.00 \nS.OO \n1.00 \n\n3.00 \n2.OO \nS.OO \n1.OO \n\n3.00 \n2.00 \nS.OO \n1.00 \n\n3.00 \n2.OO \nS.OO \n1.OO \n\nTotal \n\n1OOOO  10O.OO \n\n100.OO \n\n100.OO \n\n100.OO \n\n100.00 \n\nExample 4 \n\nExemplary Hydrogel Formulations Prepared with \nActive Substance: Sufentanil Citrate \n\nFor purposes of illustration, a number of formulations were \nprepared with active drug Substance.

The mucoadhesive testing \nsystem  is  consisting  of a  precision  load  cell  (GS-500 \nTranducer techniques, Temecula, Calif.) and a hook attach \nment. The load cell generates analogue signals, which are \nconverted into digital signals through a data acquisition sys \ntem equipped with an A/D converter and a computer; data are \nanalyzed using EasyLX software (Keithley Metrabyte). A \nhanging platform comprising a glass slide attached with plas \ntic plunger (8 cm) on the top and a circular-steel projection \n(0.5 cm) with flat surface on the bottom is attached to the load \ncell. A flat-surfaced tablet die serves as a lower static-plat \nform. The mucosal tissue is mounted onto the lower platform \nusing a screw-clamp. The hanging platform with the film is \nbrought down and placed over the surface of the mucosa with \na known applied force for a specified time. The detachment \nforce in N/cm  is determined and compared. Between each \nmeasurement, the mucosal Surface is rinsed with 4 mL of \npurified water. The excess water is wiped with a soft tissue \npaper and the mucosa is wetted with a known Volume of \nphosphate buffer pH 6.8. Studies are performed in triplicate at \nroom temperature (23-25\u00b0 C.). Adhesion and peak detach \nment force can be used to evaluate the bioadhesive strength of \ndosage forms comprising various formulations of the inven \ntion. A dosage form of the invention expresses bioadhesion \nforces greater than 100 dynes/cm, eg 500 dynes/cm. \n\nThe bioadhesive strength of the placebo formulations was \n\nevaluated and the results are given in Table 11. \n\nTABLE 11 \n\nBioadhesion force of placebo Formulations. \n\nFormulation # \n\n49 \n47 \n52 \n50 \n\nBioadhesion force, \nN/cm2 \n\nO.040  O.O1 \nO.046  -O.O1 \nO.162-  0.15 \nO.O3O  O.OO \n\n\fUS 8,865,211 B2 \n\n48 \nK.

Pain can make the \npatient feel afraid or depressed and prevent full participation \nin general rehabilitation programs and may even slow recov \nery. \n\nProperpain control is of prime importance to anyone treat \ning many different diseases or conditions. Proper pain relief \nimparts significant physiological and psychological benefits \nto the patient. Not only does effective pain relief mean a \nSmoother more pleasant recovery (e.g., mood, sleep, quality \nof life, etc.) with earlier discharge from medical/surgical/ \noutpatient facilities,  but it  may also reduce the onset of \nchronic pain syndromes (e.g., fibromyalgia, myalgia, etc.). \n\nPain serves the important biological function of signaling \nthe presence of damage or disease within the body and is often \naccompanied by inflammation (redness, Swelling, anti/or \nburning). There are two categories of pain: acute pain and \nneuropathic pain. Acute pain refers to pain experienced when \ntissue is being damaged or is damaged. Acute pain serves at \nleast two physiologically advantageous purposes. First,  it \nwarns of dangerous environmental stimuli (Such as hot or \nsharp objects) by triggering reflexive responses that end con \ntact with the dangerous stimuli. Second, if reflexive responses \ndo not avoid dangerous environmental stimuli effectively, or \ntissue injury or infection otherwise results, acute pain facili \ntates recuperative behaviors. For example, acute pain associ \nated with an injury or infection encourages an organism to \nprotect the compromised area from further insult or use while \nthe injury or infection heals. Once the dangerous environ \nmental stimulus is removed, or the injury or infection has \nresolved, acute pain, having served its physiological purpose, \nends. As contrasted to acute pain, in general, neuropathic pain \nserves no beneficial purpose. Neuropathic pain results when \npain associated with an injury or infection continues in an \narea once the injury or infection has resolved. \n\nThere are many painful diseases or conditions that require \nproper pain and/or inflammation control, including but not \nlimited to rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, a spinal disc \nherniation (i.e., Sciatica), carpal tunnel syndrome, lower back \npain, lower extremity pain, upper extremity pain, cancer, \ntissue pain and pain associated with injury or repair of cervi \ncal, thoracic, and/or lumbar vertebrae or intervertebral discs, \nrotator cuff articular joint, MIT, tendons, ligaments, muscles, \nspondilothesis, Stenosis, discogenic back pain, and joint pain \nor the like. \n\nOne particularly painful disease is sciatica. Sciatica is a \nchronic disease that often can be very debilitating and may \ntake a terrible toll on those with the disease as well as their \nfamilies, friends and caregivers. Sciatica is a very painful \ndisease associated with the Sciatic nerve, which runs from the \nlower part of the spinal cord (the lumbar region), down the \nback of the leg and to the foot. Sciatica generally begins with \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n2 \na herniated disc, which later leads to local immune system \nactivation. The herniated disc also may damage the nerve root \nby pinching or compressing it, leading to additional immune \nsystem activation in the area. \n\nAnother particularly painful disease is  spinal Stenosis, \nwhere there is progressive constriction of the spinal canal and \nas it narrows, the nerve elements that reside within it become \nprogressively more crowded. Eventually, the canal dimen \nsions become Sufficiently small-so as to significantly com \npress the nerve elements and produce pain, weakness, sen \nsory changes, clumsiness and other manifestation of nervous \nsystem dysfunction. The disease causes lower back pain, \nlower extremity pain, lower extremity weakness, limitation of \nmobility and the high disability rates that often afflict the \nelderly. \n\nSpondylolisthesis is another painful disease. Spondylolis \nthesis is a displacement disorder of the lumbar or cervical \nspine, in which one vertebral body is forwardly displaced \nover another vertebral body. Spondylolisthesis ma becaused \nby a traumatic event or by degeneration of the spine. At times, \nthe displacement disorder is accompanied by or caused by a \nfracture or partial collapse of one or more vertebrae or degen \neration of a disc in the spine. Patients who suffer from such \nconditions can experience moderate to severe distortion of the \nthoracic skeletal structure, diminished ability to bear loads, \nloss of mobility, extreme and debilitating pain, and often \ntimes Suffer neurological deficits in nerve function. \n\nThere has been considerable interest in developing effec \ntive treatments for these painful diseases, yet to date current \ntreatments are only partially effective. \n\nSUMMARY \n\nCompositions and methods are provided comprising an \nanalgesic and/or an anti-inflammatory agent that are admin \nistered in order to treat pain and/or inflammation. The pain \nand/or inflammation may for example be due to chronic con \nditions including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, a spinal \ndischerniation (e.g., Sciatica), carpal/tarsal tunnel syndrome, \nlower back pain, lower extremity pain, upper extremity pain, \ncancer, tissue pain and pain associated with injury or repair of \ncervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar vertebrae or intervertebral \ndiscs, rotator cuff, articular joint, TMJ, tendons, ligaments, \nmuscles, spondilothesis, Stenosis, discogenic back pain, and \njoint pain or the like. \n\nOne advantage of the embodiments provided herein is that \nthey utilize one or more drug depots or one or more drug depot \nregions having a different release profile for the therapeutic \nagent, which aids in the reduction, prevention or treatment of \ndifferent diseases. \n\nIn various embodiments, one or more regions of the drug \ndepot or one or more drug depots may be designed to release \nan initial burst or bolus dose of the analgesic and/or an anti \ninflammatory agent, which provides initial relief in treatment \nof diseases  (e.g.,  Sciatica,  spondilothesis,  Stenosis,  etc.), \nwhile Sustained release regions or drug depots provide Sus \ntained release of the therapeutic agent over a longer period of \ntime. In this way more effective treatments for different dis \neases or conditions. \n\nIn one embodiment, an implantable drug depot is provided \nuseful for reducing, preventing or treating pain and/or inflam \nmation in a patient in need of such treatment, the implantable \ndrug depot comprising a therapeutically effective amount of \nan analgesic and/or an anti-inflammatory agent, the depot \nbeing implantable at a site beneath the skin to reduce, prevent \nor treat pain and/or inflammation, wherein the drug depot \ncomprises (i) at least one region capable of releasing a thera \n\n\fUS 8,968,767 B2 \n\n3 \npeutically effective bolus amount of the analgesic and/or the \nanti-inflammatory agent at a site beneath the skin; and (ii) at \nleast one region capable of releasing a therapeutically effec \ntive amount of the analgesic and/or the anti-inflammatory \nagent over a period of at least three days. \n\nIn another embodiment, a kit is provided comprising a \nplurality of implantable drug depots useful for reducing, pre \nventing or treating pain and/or inflammation in a patient in \nneed of Such treatment, the kit comprising a first set of the \nplurality of drug depots capable of releasing atherapeutically \neffective bolus amount of an analgesic and/or an anti-inflam \nmatory agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof at \na site beneath the skin and a second set of the plurality of drug \ndepots capable of releasingatherapeutically effective amount \nof the analgesic and/or the anti-inflammatory agent or phar \nmaceutically acceptable salts thereof over a period of at least \nthree days. In various embodiments, by implanting different \nsets of drug depot with different release profiles, the need to \ndevelop one set of drug depots with the desired immediate \nrelease and Sustained release properties is avoided. \n\nIn one exemplary embodiment, a method of reducing, pre \nventing or treating pain and/or inflammation in a patient in \nneed of Such treatment is provided, the method comprising \nadministering a plurality of implantable drug depots at or near \na target tissue site of the patient, wherein a first set of the \nplurality of drug depots is capable of releasing a therapeuti \ncally effective bolus amount of an analgesic and/or an anti \ninflammatory agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salts \nthereof at a site beneath the skin and a second set of the \nplurality of drug depots is capable of releasing a therapeuti \ncally effective amount of the analgesic and/or the anti-inflam \nmatory agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof \nover a period of at least three days. \n\nIn another exemplary embodiment, a plurality of implant \nable drug depots is proved that are useful for reducing, pre \nventing or treating pain and/or inflammation in a patient in \nneed of such treatment, the plurality of drug depots compris \ning a first set of one or more drug depots capable of releasing \na therapeutically effective bolus dose of an analgesic and/or \nan anti-inflammatory agent or pharmaceutically acceptable \nsalts thereof at a site beneath the skin and a second set of one \nor more drug depots capable of releasing a therapeutically \neffective amount of the analgesic and/or the anti-inflamma \ntory agent orpharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof over a \nperiod of at least three days. \n\nAdditional features and advantages of various embodi \nments will be set forth in part in the description that follows, \nand in part will be apparent from the description, or may be \nlearned by practice of various embodiments.

Thus, a drug depot may comprise a \nphysical structure to facilitate implantation and retention in a \ndesired site (e.g., a disc space, a spinal canal, a tissue of the \npatient, particularly at or near a site of surgery, pain, or site of \ninflammation, etc.). The drug depot also comprises the drug \nitself. The term \"drug\u201d as used herein is generally meant to \nrefer to any Substance that alters the physiology of a patient. \nThe term \u201cdrug  may be used interchangeably herein with the \nterms  \u201ctherapeutic  agent,\u201d  \u201ctherapeutically  effective \namount,\u201d and \u201cactive pharmaceutical ingredient\u2019 or API.  It \nwill be understood that unless otherwise specified a \u201cdrug \nformulation may include more than one therapeutic agent, \nwherein  exemplary  combinations  of therapeutic  agents \ninclude a combination of two or more drugs. The drug pro \nvides a concentration gradient of the therapeutic agent for \ndelivery to the site. In various embodiments, the drug depot \nprovides an optimal drug concentration gradient of the thera \npeutic agent at a distance of up to about 0.1 cm to about 5 cm \nfrom the implant site, and comprises at least one anti-inflam \nmatory agent or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt and at \nleast one analgesic agent or its pharmaceutically acceptable \nsalt. \n\nA \u201cdepot' includes but is not limited to capsules, micro \nspheres, microparticles, microcapsules, microfibers particles, \nnanospheres, nanoparticles, coating, matrices, wafers, pills, \npellets, emulsions, liposomes, micelles, gels, or other phar \nmaceutical delivery compositions or a combination thereof. \nSuitable materials for the depot are ideally pharmaceutically \nacceptable biodegradable and/or any bioabsorbable materials \nthat are preferably FDA approved or GRAS materials. These \nmaterials can be polymeric or non-polymeric, as well as \nsynthetic or naturally occurring, or a combination thereof. \n\nA \u201ctherapeutically  effective  amount\u2019  or  \u201ceffective \namount' is such that when administered, the drug results in \nalteration of the biological activity, Such as, for example, \ninhibition of inflammation, reduction or alleviation of pain, \nimprovement in the condition through muscle relaxation, etc. \nThe dosage administered to a patient can unless otherwise \nspecified or apparent from context be as single or multiple \ndoses depending upon a variety of factors, including the \ndrug's administered pharmacokinetic properties, the route of \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n8 \nadministration, patient conditions and characteristics (sex, \nage, body weight, health, size, etc.), extent of symptoms, \nconcurrent treatments, frequency of treatment and the effect \ndesired. In some embodiments the formulation is designed for \nimmediate release. In other embodiments the formulation is \ndesigned for Sustained release. In other embodiments, the \nformulation comprises one or more immediate release Sur \nfaces and one or more Sustain release Surfaces. \n\nThe phrases \u201csustained release' or \u201csustain release' (also \nreferred to as extended release or controlled release) are used \nherein to refer to one or more therapeutic agent(s) that is \nintroduced into the body of a human or other mammal and \ncontinuously or continually releases a stream of one or more \ntherapeutic agents over a predetermined time period and at a \ntherapeutic level sufficient to achieve a desired therapeutic \neffect throughout the predetermined time period. Reference \nto a continuous or continual release stream is intended to \nencompass release that occurs as the result of biodegradation \nin vivo of the drug depot, or a matrix or component thereof, or \nas the result of metabolic transformation or dissolution of the \ntherapeutic agent(s) or conjugates of therapeutic agent(s). As \npersons of ordinary skill are aware, Sustained release formu \nlations may, by way of example, be created as films, slabs, \npellets, microparticles, microspheres, microcapsules, sphe \nroids, shaped derivatives and paste. The formulations may be \nin form that is  suitable for Suspension in isotonic saline, \nphysiological buffer or other solution acceptable for injection \ninto a patient. Further, the formulations may be used in con \njunction with any implantable, insertable or injectable system \nthat a person of ordinary skill would appreciate as useful in \nconnection with embodiments herein including but not lim \nited to parenteral formulations, microspheres, microcapsules, \ngels, pastes, implantable rods, pellets, plates or fibers, etc. \n\nThe phrase \u201cimmediate release' is used herein to refer to \none or more therapeutic agent(s) that is introduced into the \nbody and that is allowed to dissolve in or become absorbed at \nthe location to which it is administered, with no intention of \ndelaying or prolonging the dissolution or absorption of the \ndrug. Immediate release refers to the release of drug within a \nshort time period following administration, e.g., generally \nwithin a few minutes to about 1 to 2 hours. \n\nThe term \u201cmammal\u2019 refers to organisms from the tax \nonomy class  \u201cmammalian,  including but not limited to \nhumans, other primates such as chimpanzees, apes, orangu \ntans and monkeys, rats, mice, cats, dogs, cows, horses, etc. In \nvarious embodiments, the mammal is a human patient. \n\nThe phrase \u201crelease rate profile' refers to the percentage of \nactive ingredient that is released over fixed units of time, e.g., \nmcg/hr, mcg/day, mg/hr, mg/day, 10% per day for ten days, \netc. As persons of ordinary skill know, a release rate profile \nmay be but need not be linear.  By way of a non-limiting \nexample, the drug depot may be a pellet that releases at least \none analgesic agent in a bolus dose and at least one anti \ninflammatory agent over a period of time. \n\nTreating or treatment of a disease or condition refers to \nexecuting a protocol, which may include administering one or \nmore drugs to a patient (human, normal or otherwise, or other \nmammal), in an effort to alleviate signs or symptoms of the \ndisease. Alleviation can occur prior to signs or symptoms of \nthe disease or condition appearing, as well as after their \nappearance. Thus, \u201ctreating  or \u201ctreatment\u201d includes \u201cpre \nventing  or \u201cprevention  of disease or undesirable condition. \nIn addition, \u201ctreating  or \u201ctreatment\u201d does not require com \nplete alleviation of signs or symptoms, does not require a \ncure, and specifically includes protocols that have only a \nmarginal effect on the patient. \"Reducing pain' includes a \ndecrease in pain and does not require complete alleviation of \n\n\fUS 8,968,767 B2 \n\n9 \npain signs or symptoms, and does not require a cure.  In \nvarious embodiments, reducing pain includes even a marginal \ndecrease in pain. By way of example, the administration of \nthe effective dosages of at least one analgesic agent and at \nleast one anti-inflammatory agent may be used to prevent, \ntreat or relieve the symptoms of pain and/or inflammation. \n\n\u201cLocalized  delivery includes delivery where one or more \ndrugs are deposited within a tissue, for example, a nerve root \nof the nervous system or a region of the brain, or in close \nproximity (within about 10 cm, or preferably within about 5 \ncm, or within about 1  cm, or less for example) thereto. A \n\u201ctargeted delivery system' provides delivery of one or more \ndrugs depots, gels or depot dispersed in the gel having a \nquantity of therapeutic agent that can be deposited at or near \nthe target site as needed for treatment of pain, inflammation or \nother disease or condition. \n\nThe term \u201cbiodegradable' includes that all or parts of the \ndrug depot degrade over time by the action of enzymes, by \nhydrolytic action and/or by other similar mechanisms in the \nhuman body.  In  various  embodiments,  \u201cbiodegradable' \nincludes that the depot (e.g., microparticle, microsphere, etc.) \ncan break down or degrade within the body to non-toxic \ncomponents after or while a therapeutic agent has been or is \nbeing released. By \u201cbioerodible' it is meant that the depot \nwill erode or degrade over time due, at least in part, to contact \nwith Substances found in the Surrounding tissue, fluids or by \ncellular action. By \u201cbioabsorbable' it is meant that the depot \nwill be broken down and absorbed within the human body, for \nexample, by a cell or tissue. \u201cBiocompatible\u201d means that the \ndepot will not cause Substantial tissue irritation or necrosis at \nthe target tissue site. \n\nThe phrase \u201cpain management medication\u201d includes one or \nmore therapeutic agents that are administered to prevent, \nalleviate or remove pain entirely. These include anti-inflam \nmatory agents, muscle relaxants, analgesics, anesthetics, nar \ncotics, and so forth, and combinations thereof. \n\nIn various embodiments, the depot can be designed to \ncause an initial burst dose of one or more therapeutic agents \nwithin the first 24 hours after implantation. \u201cInitial burst' or \n\u201cburst effect\u201d or \u201cbolus dose\u201d or \u201cpulse dose\u201d refer to the \nrelease of therapeutic agent from the depot during the first 24 \nhours after the depot comes in contact with an aqueous fluid \n(e.g., synovial fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, etc.). The burst \neffect  may be an mediate release.  The \u201cburst effect\u201d  is \nbelieved to be due to the increased release of therapeutic agent \nfrom the depot. The initial burst effect or bolus dose may be \ndetermined before hand by formulating the depot by calcu \nlating the quotient obtained by dividing (i)  the effective \namount by weight of therapeutic agent to be released from the \ndepot or region in a predetermined initial period of time after \nimplantation of the depot, by (ii) the total amount of thera \npeutic agent that is to be delivered from an implanted com \nposition.  It  is  understood that  the initial  burst may vary \ndepending on the shape and Surface area of the implant. \n\nThe burst effect with respect to the region or depot, in \nvarious embodiments, can be designed so that a larger initial \ndose may be released over a short period of time to achieve the \ndesired effect. For example, if a drug depot is designed to \nrelease 15 mg of morphine per 48 hours, then the initial burst \ndose or bolus dose region or depot will be designed to release \na percentage of the dose within the first 24 hours 10 mg of \nmorphine or 66% of the 48 hour dose within 24 hours). Thus, \nthe burst effect of the drug depot or region releases more \ntherapeutic agent than the Sustained release region or depot. \nA region or depot that utilizes a burst effect or bolus dose \nwill release more therapeutic agent (e.g., analgesic and/or \nanti-inflammatory) than the Sustained release region or depot. \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n10 \nFor example, particularly with painful chronic conditions \nincluding rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, a spinal disc \nherniation  (e.g.,  Sciatica),  carpal/tarsal  tunnel  syndrome, \nlower back pain, lower extremity pain, upper extremity pain, \ncancer, tissue pain and pain associated with injury or repair of \ncervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar vertebrae or intervertebral \ndiscs, rotator cuff, articular joint, TMJ, tendons, ligaments, \nmuscles, spondilothesis, Stenosis, discogenic back pain, and \njoint pain or the like, the initial burst effect of the drug depot \nor region of the drug depot will be advantageous as it will \nprovide more immediate pain and/or inflammation relief as a \nbolus dose of drug will be released at or near the target tissue \nsite and provide the desired reducing, oralleviation of signs or \nsymptoms of pain and/or inflammation. For example, the \ndrug depot or region of the drug depot may release 51%, 52%, \n53%, 54%, 55%, 9% 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, \n63%, 64%. 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, \n73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, \n83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, \n93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% of the daily \ndose within the first one to twelve hours to reduce, prevent or \ntreat pain and/or inflammation. The pain and/or inflammation \nmay also be due to Surgery. \n\nThe drug depot comprising at least one analgesic agent or \nits pharmaceutically acceptable salt and at least one anti \ninflammatory agent or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt \nmay be co-administered with a muscle relaxant. Co-admin \nistration may involve administering at the same time in sepa \nrate drug depots or formulating together in the same drug \ndepot. \n\nExemplary muscle relaxants include by way of example \nand not limitation, alcuronium chloride, atracurium bescy \nlate, baclofen, carbolonium, carisoprodol, chlorphenesin car \nbamate, chlorZoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, dantrolene, deca \nmethonium bromide,  fazadinium,  gallamine  triethiodide, \nhexafluorenium,  meladrazine,  mephensin,  metaxalone, \nmethocarbamol, metocurine iodide, pancuronium, pridinol \nmesylate,  styramate,  suxamethonium, SuXethonium, thio \ncolchicoside, tizanidine, tolperisone, tubocuarine, vecuro \nnium, or combinations thereof. \n\nThe drug depot may also comprise other therapeutic agents \nor active ingredients in addition to the at least one analgesic \nagent or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt and at least one \nanti-inflammatory agent or its pharmaceutically acceptable \nsalt. Suitable additional therapeutic agents include, but are \nnot limited to, integrin antagonists, alpha-4 beta-7 integrin \nantagonists,  cell  adhesion  inhibitors,  interferon  gamma \nantagonists, CTLA4-Ig agonists/antagonists (BMS-188667), \nCD40 ligandantagonists, Humanized anti-IL-6 mAb (MRA, \nTocilizumab, Chugai), HMGB-1 mAb (Critical Therapeutics \nInc.), anti-IL2R antibodies (daclizumab, basilicimab), ABX \n(anti IL-8 antibodies), recombinant human IL-10, or HuMax \nIL-15 (anti-IL 15 antibodies). \n\nOther Suitable therapeutic agents that may be co-adminis \ntered with the anti-inflammatory agent and analgesic agent \ninclude IL-1 inhibitors, such Kineret(R) (anakinra) which is a \nrecombinant, non-glycosylated form of the human inerleu \nkin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), or AMG 108, which is a \nmonoclonal antibody that blocks the action of IL-1. Thera \npeutic agents also include excitatory amino acids such as \nglutamate  and  aspartate,  antagonists  or  inhibitors  of \nglutamate binding to NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, \nand/or kainate receptors. It is contemplated that where desir \nable a pegylated form of the above may be used.

The drug \ndepot may release a longer Sustained release dose based on \nthe daily dosage. \n\nThe at least one anti-inflammatory agent and at least one \nanalgesic agent may also be administered with non-active \ningredients. These non-active ingredients may have multi \nfunctional purposes including the carrying, stabilizing and \ncontrolling the release of the therapeutic agent(s). The Sus \ntained release process, for example, may be by a solution \ndiffusion mechanism or it may be governed by an erosion \nsustained process. Typically, the depot will be a solid or \nsemi-solid formulation comprised of a biocompatible mate \nrial that can be biodegradable. The term \"solid  is intended to \nmean a rigid material, while 'semi-solid  is intended to mean \na material that has some degree of flexibility, thereby allow \ning the depot to bend and conform to the Surrounding tissue \nrequirements. \n\nIn various embodiments, the non-active ingredients will be \ndurable within the tissue site for a period of time equal to (for \nbiodegradable components) or greater than (for non-biode \ngradable components) the planned period of drug delivery. \nFor example, the depot material may have a melting point or \nglass transition temperature close to or higher than body \ntemperature, but lower than the decomposition or degradation \ntemperature of the therapeutic agent. However, the pre-deter \nmined erosion of the depot material can also be used to \nprovide for slow release of the loaded therapeutic agent(s). \n\nIn various embodiments, the drug depot may not be biode \ngradable or comprise material that is not biodegradable. Non \nbiodegradable polymers include, but are not limited to, vari \nous cellulose derivatives (carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose \nacetate, cellulose acetate propionate, ethyl cellulose, hydrox \nypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxyalkyl methyl celluloses, \nand alkyl  celluloses),  silicon and silicon-based polymers \n(such  as  polydimethylsiloxane),  polyethylene-co-(vinyl \nacetate),  poloxamer,  polyvinylpyrrolidone,  poloxamine, \npolypropylene, polyamide, polyacetal, polyester, polyethyl \nene-chlorotrifluoroethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE \nor  \u201cTeflonTM,  styrene  butadiene  rubber,  polyethylene, \npolypropylene, polyphenylene oxide-polystyrene, poly-C.- \nchloro-p-Xylene, polymethylpentene, polysulfone, non-de \ngradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (e.g., ethylene vinyl acetate \ndisks and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate)), and other related \nbiostable polymers or combinations thereof. \n\nThe drug depot may comprise nun-resorbable polymers as \nwell. These non-resorbable polymers can include, but are not \nlimited to, delrin, polyurethane, copolymers of silicone and \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n16 \npolyurethane, polyolefins (such as polyisobutylene and poly \nisoprene), acrylamides (such as polyacrylic acid and poly \n(acrylonitrile-acrylic acid)), neoprene, nitrile, acrylates (such \nas polyacrylates, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), methyl \nmethacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and copolymers \nof acrylates with N-vinyl pyrrolidone), lactams, polyacry \nlonitrile, glucomannan gel, Vulcanized rubber and combina \ntions thereof Examples of polyurethanes include thermoplas \ntic  polyurethanes,  aliphatic  polyurethanes,  segmented \npolyurethanes,  hydrophilic  polyurethanes,  polyether-ure \nthane, polycarbonate-urethane and silicone polyether-ure \nthane. Typically, the non-degradable drug depots may need to \nbe removed. \n\nIn some instance, it may be desirable to avoid having to \nremove the drug depot after use. In those instances, the depot \nmay comprise a biodegradable material. There are numerous \nmaterials available for this purpose and having the character \nistic of being able to breakdown or disintegrate over a pro \nlonged period of time when positioned at or near the target \ntissue. As a function of the chemistry of the biodegradable \nmaterial, the mechanism of the degradation process can be \nhydrolytical or enzymatical in nature, or both. In various \nembodiments, the degradation can occur either at the Surface \n(heterogeneous or Surface erosion) or uniformly throughout \nthe drug delivery system depot (homogeneous or bulk ero \nsion). \n\nIn various embodiments, the depot may comprise a bioab \nsorbable, and/or a biodegradable biopolymer that may pro \nvide immediate release, or Sustained release of the at least one \nanalgesic agent and at least one anti-inflammatory agent. \nExamples of suitable sustained release biopolymers include \nbut are not limited to poly (alpha-hydroxy acids), poly (lac \ntide-co-glycolide) (PLGA or PLG) polylactide (PLA), polyg \nlycolide (PG), polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugates of poly \n(alpha-hydroxy acids), polyorthoesters, polyaspirins, poly \nphosphagenes,  collagen,  starch,  pre-gelatinized  starch, \nhyaluronic acid, chitosans, gelatin, alginates, albumin, fibrin, \nVitamin E analogs, such as alpha tocopheryl acetate, d-alpha \ntocopheryl Succinate,  D.L-lactide, or L-lactide, poly(gly \ncollide-,-caprolactone), -caprolactone, dextrans, vinylpyrroli \ndone, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA-g-PLGA, PEGT-PBT \ncopolymer (polyactive),  methacrylates,  poly(N-isopropy \nlacrylamide), PEO-PPO-PEO (pluronics), PEO-PPO-PAA \ncopolymers, PLGA-PEO-PLGA, PEG-PLO, PLA-PLGA, \npoloxamer  407,  PEG-PLGA-PEG  triblock  copolymers, \nSAIB (sucrose acetate isobutyrate) or combinations thereof. \nAs persons of ordinary skill are aware, mPEG may be used as \na plasticizer for PLGA, but other polymers/excipients may be \nused to achieve the same effect. mPEG imparts malleability to \nthe resulting formulations. \n\nWhere different combinations of polymers are used (bi, tri \n(e.g., PLGA-PEO-PLGA) or terpolymers), they may be used \nin different molar ratios, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, \n9:1, or 10:1. For example, for a 130-day release drug depot, \nthe polymer make up is  50:50 PLGA to  100 PLA. The \nmolecular weight range is 0.45 to 0.8 dI/g. \n\nIn various embodiments, the molecular weight of the poly \nmer can be a wide range of values. The average molecular \nweight of the polymer can be from about 1000 to about \n10,000,000; or about 1,000 to about 1,000,000; or about \n5,000 to about 500,000; or about 10,000 to about 100,000; or \nabout 20,000 to 50,000. \n\nIn some embodiments, the at least one biodegradable poly \nmer comprises poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLA) or poly \n(orthoester) (POE) or a combination thereof. The polylactic \nco-glycolic acid) may comprise a mixture of polyglycolide \n(PGA) and polylactide and in some embodiments, in the \n\n\fUS 8,968,767 B2 \n\n17 \nmixture, there is more polylactide than polyglycolide.

In various embodiments, the drug \ndepot can be shaped like a pellet, a sphere, a cylinder Such as \na rod or fiber, a flat surface such as a disc, film or sheet, or the \nlike.  Flexibility may be a consideration so as to facilitate \nplacement of the drug depot. In various embodiments, the \ndrug depot can be different sizes, for example, the drug depot \nmay be a length of from about 0.5 mm to 5 mm and have a \ndiameter of from about 0.01  to  about 2 mm. In various \nembodiments, the drug depot may have a layer thickness of \nfrom about 0.005 to 1.0 mm, such as, for example, from 0.05 \nto 0.75 mm. \n\nRadiographic markers can be included on the drug depot to \npermit the user to position the depot accurately into the target \nsite of the patient. These radiographic markers will also per \nmit the user to track movement and degradation of the depot \nat the site over time, in this embodiment, the user may accu \nrately position the depot in the site using any of the numerous \ndiagnostic imaging procedures. Such diagnostic imaging pro \ncedures include, for example, X-ray imaging or fluoroscopy. \nExamples of Such radiographic markers include, but are not \nlimited to, barium, calcium phosphate, and/or metal beads or \nparticles. In various embodiments, the radiographic marker \ncould be a spherical shape or a ring around the depot. \n\nFIG. 1 is a schematic drawing illustrating an embodiment \nof one drug depot 10 composition having a first region or layer \n12 capable of releasing a  therapeutically  effective burst \namount or bolus dose or pulse dose or immediate release of \nthe analgesic and/or the anti-inflammatory agent as the depot \ncomes in contact with the bodily fluid and the layer or region \ndegrades and releases the therapeutic agent(s). In this way, \nshort-term relief of pain and/or inflammation can be provided \nto the patient. A second layer or region (shown as the core) of \nthe depot shown as 14 is capable of releasingatherapeutically \neffective amount of the analgesic and the anti-inflammatory \nagent over a longer period of time (e.g., at least 3 days to 6 \nmonths) as this region or layer comes into contact with bodily \nfluid. \n\nAlthough the initial burst region or layer is shown sepa \nrately from the sustained release layer, it will be understood \nthat the initial burst region or layer may be combined with the \nSustained release region or layer and thus when fluid contacts \nthe depot each layer will release at different release rates. It \nwill also be understood that, although the depot is shown with \ntwo layers or regions (12 and 14), the depot may comprise one \nor multiple layers or regions (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, \nseven, eight, nine ten, etc.). For example, a first immediate \nrelease layer or region may be disposed on a first Sustained \nrelease layer and a second immediate release layer may be \ndisposed on the first Sustained release layer, and so on. It will \nalso be understood that the depot may be formed from a \nmixture of a sustained release formulation with a burst release \nformulation that are combined together. \n\nFor example, the depot may be formed from separate dif \nferent micelles (one or more bolus release micelle and one or \nmore Sustained release micelles) having different release pro \nfiles that are combined together. In various embodiments, the \nplurality of depots may comprise biodegradable therapeutic \nparticles dispersed within a gel and as the gel degrades, the \ntherapeutic particles are released. \n\n\fUS 8,968,767 B2 \n\n19 \nFIG. 1A is a schematic drawing illustrating an embodiment \nof one drug depot composition 10 having a plurality  of \nregions 12 capable of releasing a therapeutically effective \nburst amount or bolus dose or pulse dose or immediate release \nof the analgesic and/or the anti-inflammatory agent as the \nregion degrades when it comes into contact with bodily fluid. \nRegion 14 is capable of releasing a therapeutically effective \namount of the analgesic and the anti-inflammatory agent over \nalonger period of time (Sustained release over a longer period \nof time) as the region degrades when it comes into contact \nwith bodily fluid. \n\nFIG. 2 is a schematic drawing illustrating an embodiment \nof one drug depot composition having a plurality of regions \n12 capable of releasing a therapeutically effective a burst \namount or bolus dose or pulse dose or immediate release of \nthe  analgesic  and/or the anti-inflammatory  agent,  when \nbodily fluids come in contact with the region. A plurality of \nregions 14 are provided and are capable of releasing a thera \npeutically effective amount of the analgesic and the anti \ninflammatory agent over a longer period of time, when bodily \nfluid come in contact with these regions. The regions 12 and \n14 may be housed in the drug depot housing 16, which also \nmay be biodegradable as well as the regions. \n\nFIG. 3 is a schematic drawing illustrating an embodiment \nof a plurality of drug depots, a first set of drug depots 12 \ncapable of releasing a therapeutically effective burst amount \nor bolus dose or pulse dose or immediate release of the anal \ngesic and/or the anti-inflammatory agent and a plurality of \nregions 14 capable of releasing a therapeutically effective \namount of the analgesic and the anti-inflammatory agent over \na longer period of time (Sustained release). Thus, in this \nembodiment, there is a set of drug depots. One set may have \na burst release or bolus release or pulse release or immediate \nrelease and the other set may be Sustained release over a \nlonger period of time. Thus, the first and second depot set \nhave different release profiles. In this embodiment, a number \nof pellets  for different diseases/conditions (e.g.,  Sciatica, \npost-operative pain etc.) with various drug release kinetics, \nsome with fast release and other with slow release can be \nimplanted together thus avoiding the need for one drug depot \nwith complicated release kinetics. In conditions, for example, \npost-operative pain, one can implant 3-5 strips at the Surgical \nsite in one patient at a time to reduce, prevent or treat post \noperative pain. \n\nA strategy of triangulation may be effective when admin \nistering these multiple depot pharmaceutical formulations. \nThus, a plurality (at least two, at least three, at least four, at \nleast five, at least six, at least seven, etc.) drug depots com \nprising  the  pharmaceutical  formulations  may be placed \naround the target tissue site (also known as the pain generator \nor pain generation site such that the target tissue site falls \nwithin a region that is either between the formulations when \nthere are two, or within an area whose perimeter is defined by \na set of plurality of formulations. \n\nVarious factors can be adjusted to achieve the initial burst \nof therapeutic agent release. First, the initial burst can be \ncontrolled by factors related to the property of the depot, such \nas the water immiscibility of the solvent, polymer/solvent \nratio, and the property of the polymer. The extent of water \nimmiscibility of the solvent used in the depot affects that rate \naqueous body fluid can penetrate the depot to release the \ntherapeutic agent. Generally, higher water solubility leads to \na higher initial burst while water immiscibility leads to a \nlower initial burst or slower release (sustained release) of the \ntherapeutic agent. \n\nSuitable solvents that can be used to control initial burst \nrelease or Sustained release include, but are not limited to, \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n20 \nmethylbenzoate, ethylbenzoate, n-propylbenzoate, isopro \npyl benzoate, butylbenzoate, isobutylbenzoate, sec-butyl \nbenzoate, tert-butylbenzoate, isoamylbenzoate, benzylben \nZoate, water, alcohol, low molecular weight PEG (less than \n1,000 MW), triacetin, diacetin, tributyrin, triethyl citrate, \ntributyl citrate, acetyl triethyl citrate, acetyl tributyl citrate, \ntriethylglycerides,  triethyl  phosphate,  diethyl  phthalate, \ndiethyl tartrate, mineral oil, polybutene, silicone fluid, glyc \nerin, ethylene glycol, octanol, ethyl lactate, propylene glycol, \npropylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, butyrolactone, eth \nylene  oxide,  propylene  oxide,  N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, \n2-pyrrolidone, glycerol formal, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, \nmethyl ethyl ketone, dimethylformamide, glycofurol, dim \nethyl Sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, caprolactam, decylmethyl \nSulfoxide,  oleic acid,  1-dodecylazacyclo-heptan-2-one, or \nmixtures  thereof. The solvent can be mixed, in  various \nembodiments, with the therapeutic agent and/or polymers to \nobtain the desired release profile. \n\nThe depot may have pore forming agents, which include \nbiocompatible materials that when contacted with body fluids \ndissolve, disperse or degrade to create pores or channels in the \npolymer matrix. Typically, organic and non-organic materials \nthat are water soluble such as Sugars (e.g., Sucrose, dextrose), \nwater soluble salts (e.g., Sodium chloride, Sodium phosphate, \npotassium chloride, and Sodium carbonate), water soluble \nsolvents such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and polyethylene \nglycol and water soluble polymers (e.g., carboxymethylcel \nlulose, hydroxypropyl-cellulose, and the like) can conve \nniently be used as pore formers. Such materials may be \npresentinamounts varying from about 0.1% to about 100% of \nthe weight of the polymer, but will typically be less than 50% \nand more typically less than 10-20% of the weight of poly \n\nC. \nFurther, varying the molecular weight of the polymer in the \ndepot, or adjusting the molecular weight distribution of the \npolymer material in the depot vehicle can affect the initial \nburst and the release rate of therapeutic agent from the depot. \nGenerally, a higher molecular weight polymer renders a \nlower initial burst and slower release rate of the therapeutic \nagent. The polymers may have different end groups such as \nacid and ester end groups. As persons of ordinary skill in the \nart are aware, implantable elastomeric depot compositions \nhaving a blend of polymers with different end groups are used \nthe resulting formulation will have a lower burst index and a \nregulated duration of delivery. For example, one may use \npolymers with acid (e.g.,  carboxylic acid) and ester end \ngroups (e.g., methyl of ethyl ester end groups). \n\nAdditionally, by varying the comonomer ratio of the vari \nous monomers that form a polymer (e.g., the L/G (lactic \nacid/glycolic acid) or G/CL (glycolic acid/polycaprolactone) \nratio for a given polymer) there will be a resulting depot \ncomposition having a regulated burst index and duration of \ndelivery. For example, a depot composition having a polymer \nwith a L/Gratio of 50:50 may have a short duration of delivery \nranging from about two days to about one month; a depot \ncomposition having a polymer with a L/G ratio of 65:35 may \nhave a duration of delivery of about two months; a depot \ncomposition having a polymer with a L/G ratio of 75:25 or \nL/CL ratio of 75:25 may have a duration of delivery of about \nthree months to about four months; a depot composition \nhaving a polymer ratio with a L/G ratio of 85:15 may have a \nduration of delivery of about five months; a depot composi \ntion having a polymer with a L/CL ratio of 25:75 or PLA may \nhave a duration of delivery greater than or equal to six \nmonths; a depot composition having a terpolymer of CL/G/L \nwith G greater than 50% and L. greater than 10% may have a \nduration of delivery of about one month and a depot compo \n\n\fUS 8,968,767 B2 \n\n21 \nsition having a terpolymer of CL/G/L with Gless than 50% \nand L. less than 10% may have a duration months up to six \nmonths. In general, increasing the G content relative to the CL \ncontent shortens the duration of delivery whereas increasing \nthe CL content relative to the G content lengthens the duration \nof delivery. Thus, among other things, depot compositions \nhaving  a blend of polymers having different  molecular \nweights, end groups and comonomer ratios can be used to \ncreate a depot formulation having a lower burst index and a \nregulated duration of delivery. \n\nFactors such as the particle size, the disintegration of the \nparticulates, the morphology of the particulates (e.g., whether \npores are present in the particulates before implanting or can \nbe formed easily by body fluid attack), coatings, complex \nformation by the therapeutic agent and the strength of com \nplex bond, can be manipulated to achieve the desired low \ninitial burst and release rate. \n\nIn various embodiments, the drug depot comprises poly \n(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), polylactide (PLA), polygly \ncollide (PGA), D-lactide, D.L-lactide, L-lactide, D.L-lactide \ne-caprolactone, \nD.L-lactide-glycolide-e-caprolactone, \nglycolide-caprolactone or a combination thereof. \n\nGel \nIn various embodiments, the gel has a pre-dosed viscosity \nin the range of about 1  to about 500 centipoise (cps), 1  to \nabout 200 cps, or 1 to about 100 cps. After the gel is admin \nistered to the target site, the viscosity of the gel will increase \nand the gel will have a modulus of elasticity (Young's modu \nlus) in the range of about 1x10\" to about 6x10dynes/cm, or \n2x10  to about 5x10  dynes/cm, or 5x10  to about 5x10 \ndynes/cm. \n\nIn one embodiment, a depot comprises an adherent gel \ncomprising at least one analgesic agent and at least one anti \ninflammatory agent that is evenly distributed throughout the \ngel. The gel may be of any Suitable type, as previously indi \ncated, and should be sufficiently viscous So as to prevent the \ngel from migrating from the targeted delivery  site  once \ndeployed; the gel should, in effect, \u201cstick\u201d or adhere to the \ntargeted tissue site. The gel may, for example, Solidify upon \ncontact with the targeted tissue or after deployment from a \ntargeted delivery system. The targeted delivery system may \nbe, for example, a Syringe, a catheter, needle or cannula or any \nother suitable device. The targeted delivery system may inject \nthe gel into or on the targeted tissue site. Thetherapeutic agent \nmay be mixed into the gel prior to the gel being deployed at \nthe targeted tissue site. In various embodiments, the gel may \nbe part of a two-component delivery system and when the two \ncomponents are mixed, a chemical process is activated to \nform the gel and cause it to Stick or to adhere to the target \ntissue. \n\nIn various embodiments, a gel is provided that hardens or \nstiffens after delivery. Typically, hardening gel formulations \nmay have a pre-dosed modulus of elasticity in the range of \nabout 1x10\" to about 3x10  dynes/cm, or 2x10  to about \n2x10 dynes/cm, or 5x10\" to about 1x10 dynes/cm. The \npost-dosed hardening gels (after delivery) may have a rubbery \nconsistency and have a modulus of elasticity in the range of \nabout 1x10\" to about 2x 10\u00b0 dynes/cm, or 1x10  to about \n7x10dynes/cm, or 2x10 to about 5x10 dynes/cm. \n\nIn various embodiments, for those gel formulations that \ncontain a polymer, the polymer concentration may affect the \nrate at which the gel hardens (e.g., a gel with a higher con \ncentration of polymer may coagulate more quickly than gels \nhaving a lower concentration of polymer). In various embodi \nments, when the gel hardens, the resulting matrix is solid but \nis also able to conform to the irregular surface of the tissue \n(e.g., recesses and/or projections in bone). \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n22 \nThe percentage of polymer present in the gel may also \naffect  the  viscosity  of the  polymeric  composition.  For \nexample, a composition having a higher percentage by weight \nof polymer is typically thicker and more viscous than a com \nposition having a lower percentage by weight of polymer. A \nmore viscous composition tends to flow more slowly. There \nfore, a composition having a lower viscosity may be preferred \nin some instances. \n\nIn various embodiments, the molecular weight of the gel \ncan be varied by any one of the many methods known in the \nart. The choice of method to vary molecular weight is typi \ncally determined by the composition of the gel (e.g., polymer \nVersus non-polymer). For example in various embodiments, \nwhen the gel comprises one or more polymers, the degree of \npolymerization can be controlled by varying the amount of \npolymer initiators (e.g. benzoyl peroxide), organic solvents \nor activator (e.g. DMPT), crosslinking agents, polymeriza \ntion agent, and/or reaction time. \n\nSuitable gel polymers may be soluble in an organic solvent. \nThe solubility of a polymer in a solvent varies depending on \nthe  crystallinity,  hydrophobicity,  hydrogen-bonding  and \nmolecular weight of the polymer. Lower molecular weight \npolymers will normally dissolve more readily in an organic \nSolvent than high-molecular weight polymers. A polymeric \ngel, which includes a high molecular weight polymer, tends to \ncoagulate or Solidify more quickly than a polymeric compo \nsition, which includes a low-molecular weight polymer. Poly \nmeric gel formulations, which include high molecular weight \npolymers, also tend to have a higher Solution viscosity than a \npolymeric gel, which include a low-molecular weight poly \n\nC. \nWhen the gel is designed to be a flow-able gel, it can vary \nfrom low viscosity, similar to that of water, to a high Viscosity, \nsimilar to that of a paste, depending on the molecular weight \nand concentration of the polymer used in the gel. The Viscos \nity of the gel can be varied such that the polymeric composi \ntion can be applied to a patient's tissues by any convenient \ntechnique, for example, by brushing, dripping, injecting, or \npainting. Different viscosities of the gel will depend on the \ntechnique used to apply the composition. \n\nIn various embodiments, the gel has an inherent viscosity \n(abbreviated as \u201cI.V.  and units are in deciliters/gram), which \nis a measure of the gel's molecular weight and degradation \ntime (e.g., a gel with a high inherent viscosity has a higher \nmolecular weight and longer degradation time). Typically, a \ngel with a high molecular weight provides a stronger matrix \nand the matrix takes more time to degrade. In contrast, a gel \nwith a low molecular weight degrades more quickly and \nprovides a softer matrix. In various embodiments, the gel has \na molecular weight, as shown by the inherent Viscosity, from \nabout 0.10 dL/g to about 1.2dL/g or from about 0.10 dL/g to \nabout 0.40 dL/g. \n\nIn various embodiments, the gel can have a viscosity of \nabout 300 to about 5,000 centipoise (cp). In other embodi \nments, the gel can have a viscosity of from about 5 to about \n300 cps, from about 10 cps to about 50 cps, from about 15 cps \nto about 75 cps at room temperature. The gel may optionally \nhave a viscosity  enhancing agent such as,  for example, \nhydroxypropyl  cellulose,  hydroxypropyl  methylcellulose, \nhydroxyethyl methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose and \nsalts  thereof,  Carbopol, poly-(hydroxyethylmethacrylate), \npoly-(methoxyethylmethacrylate), poly(methoxyethoxyeth \nylmethacrylate), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), methyl \nmethacrylate (MMA), gelatin, polyvinyl alcohols, propylene \nglycol, PEG 200, PEG 300, PEG 400, PEG 500, PEG 600, \nPEG 700, PEG 800, PEG 900, PEG 1000, PEG 1450, PEG \n3350, PEG 4500, PEG 8000 or combinations thereof. \n\n\fUS 8,968,767 B2 \n\n23 \nIn various embodiments, when a polymer is employed in \nthe gel, the polymeric composition includes about 10 wt % to \nabout 90 wt % or about 30 wt % to about 60 wt % of the \npolymer. \n\nIn various embodiments, the gel is a hydrogel made of high \nmolecular weight biocompatible elastomeric polymers of \nsynthetic or natural origin. A desirable property for the hydro \ngel to have is the ability to respond rapidly to mechanical \nstresses, particularly shears and loads, in the human body. \n\nHydrogels obtained from natural Sources are particularly \nappealing because they are more likely to be biodegradable \nand biocompatible for in vivo applications. Suitable hydro \ngels include natural hydrogels, such as, for example, gelatin, \ncollagen,  silk,  elastin,  fibrin  and polysaccharide-derived \npolymers like agarose, and chitosan, glucomannangel, hyalu \nronic acid, polysaccharides, such as cross-linked carboxyl \ncontaining polysaccharides, or a combination thereof. Syn \nthetic hydrogels include, but are not limited to those formed \nfrom polyvinyl alcohol, acrylamides Such as polyacrylic acid \nand poly(acrylonitrile-acrylic acid), polyurethanes, polyeth \nylene glycol (e.g., PEG 3350, PEG 4500, PEG 8000), sili \ncone, polyolefins such as polyisobutylene and polyisoprene, \ncopolymers of silicone and polyurethane, neoprene, nitrile, \nVulcanized  rubber,  poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone),  acrylates \nSuch as poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) and copolymers \nof acrylates with N-vinyl pyrolidone, N-vinyl lactams, poly \nacrylonitrile or combinations thereof. The hydrogel materials \nmay further be cross-linked to provide further strength as \nneeded. Examples of different types of polyurethanes include \nthermoplastic or thermoset polyurethanes, aliphatic or aro \nmatic polyurethanes, polyetherurethane, polycarbonate-ure \nthane  or  silicone  polyether-urethane,  or  a combination \nthereof. \n\nIn various embodiments, rather than directly admixing the \ntherapeutic agents into the gel, microspheres may be dis \npersed within the gel, the microspheres being loaded with at \nleast one analgesic agent and at least one anti-inflammatory \nagent. In one embodiment, the microspheres provide for a \nSustained release of the at least one analgesic agent and at \nleast one anti-inflammatory agent. In yet another embodi \nment, the gel, which is biodegradable, prevents the micro \nspheres from releasing the at least one analgesic agent and at \nleast one anti-inflammatory agent; the microspheres thus do \nnot release the at least one analgesic agent and at least one \nanti-inflammatory agent until they have been released from \nthe gel. For example, a gel may be deployed around a target \ntissue site (e.g., a nerve root). Dispersed within the gel are a \nplurality of microspheres that encapsulate the desired thera \npeutic agent. Certain of these microspheres degrade once \nreleased from the gel, thus releasing the at least one analgesic \nagent and at least one anti-inflammatory agent. The analgesic \nagents and anti-inflammatory agents may be placed into sepa \nrate microspheres and then the microspheres combined, or the \nactive ingredients can first be combined and then placed into \nthe microspheres together. \n\nMicrospheres, much like a fluid, may disperse relatively \nquickly, depending upon the Surrounding tissue type, and \nhence disperse the at least one analgesic agent and at least one \nanti-inflammatory agent. In some embodiments, the diameter \nof the microspheres range from about 10 microns in diameter \nto about 200 microns in diameter. In some embodiments they \nrange from about 20 to 120 microns in diameters. Methods for \nmaking microspheres include but are not limited to Solvent \nevaporation, phase separation and fluidized bed coating. In \nSome situations, this may be desirable; in others, it may be \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n24 \nmore desirable to keep the at least one analgesic agent and at \nleast one anti-inflammatory agent tightly constrained to a \nwell-defined target site. \n\nThe present invention also contemplates the use of adher \nent gels to so constrain dispersal of the therapeutic agent. \nThese gels may be deployed, for example, in a disc space, in \na spinal canal, or in Surrounding tissue. \nCannulas and Needles \n\nIt will be appreciated by those with skill in the art that the \ndepot can be administered to the target site using a \"cannula\u201d \nor \u201cneedle' that can be a part of a drug delivery device e.g., a \nSyringe, a gun drug delivery device, or any medical device \nSuitable for the application of a drug to a targeted organ or \nanatomic region. The cannula or needle of the drug depot \ndevice is designed to cause minimal physical and psychologi \ncal trauma to the patient. \n\nCannulas or needles include tubes that may be made from \nmaterials.  Such as for example, polyurethane, poly-urea, \npolyether(amide),  PEBA,  thermoplastic  stomeric  olefin, \ncopolyester, and styrenic thermoplastic elastomer, steel, alu \nminum, stainless steel, titanium, metal alloys with high non \nferrous metal content and a low relative proportion of iron, \ncarbon fiber, glass fiber, plastics, ceramics or combinations \nthereof. The cannula or needle may optionally include one or \nmore tapered regions. In various embodiments, the cannula or \nneedle may be beveled. The cannula or needle may also have \na tip style vital for accurate treatment of the patient depending \non the site for implantation. Examples of tip styles include, \nfor example, Trephine, Cournand, Veress, Huber, Seldinger, \nChiba, Francine, Bias, Crawford, deflected tips,  Hustead, \nLancet, or Tuohey. In various embodiments, the cannula or \nneedle may also be non-coring and have a sheath covering it \nto avoid unwanted needle Sticks. \n\nThe dimensions of the hollow cannula or needle, among \nother things, will depend on the site for implantation. For \nexample, width of the epidural space is only about 3-5 mm for \nthe thoracic region and about 5-7 mm for the lumbar region. \nThus, the needle or cannula, in various embodiments, can be \ndesigned for these specific areas. In various embodiments, the \ncannula or needle may be inserted using a transforaminal \napproach in the spinal foramen space, for example, along an \ninflammed nerve root and the drug depot implanted at this site \nfor treating  the  condition.  Typically,  the  transforaminal \napproach  involves  approaching  the  intervertebral  space \nthrough the intervertebral foramina. \n\nSome examples of lengths of the cannula or needle may \ninclude, but are not limited to, from about 50 to 150 mm in \nlength, for example, about 65 mm for epidural pediatric use, \nabout 85 mm for a standard adult and about 110 mm for an \nobese adult patient. The thickness of the cannula or needle \nwill also depend on the site  of implantation.  In various \nembodiments, the thickness includes, but is not limited to, \nfrom about 0.05 to about 1.655. The gauge of the cannula or \nneedle may be the widest or smallest diameter or a diameter in \nbetween for insertion into a human or animal body. The \nwidest diameter is typically about 14 gauge, while the Small \nest diameter is about 25 gauge. In various embodiments the \ngauge of the needle or cannula is about 18 to about 22 gauge. \nIn various embodiments, like the drug depot and/or gel, the \ncannula or needle includes dose radiographic markers that \nindicate locationator near the site beneath the skin, so that the \nuser may accurately position the depotator near the site using \nany of the numerous diagnostic imaging procedures. Such \ndiagnostic imaging procedures include, for example, X-ray \nimaging or fluoroscopy.  Examples of Such radiographic \nmarkers include, but are not limited to, barium, calcium phos \nphate, and/or metal beads or particles. \n\n\fUS 8,968,767 B2 \n\n25 \nIn  various  embodiments, the  needle or cannula  may \ninclude a transparent or translucent portion that can be visu \nalizable by ultrasound, fluoroscopy, X-ray, or other imaging \ntechniques. In Such embodiments, the transparent or translu \ncent portion may include a radiopaque material or ultrasound \nresponsive topography that increases the contrast of the \nneedle or cannula relative to the absence of the material or \ntopography. \nSterilization \n\nThe drug depot, and/or medical device to administer the \ndrug may be sterilizable. In various embodiments, one or \nmore components of the drug depot, and/or medical device to \nadminister the drug are sterilized by radiation in a terminal \nsterilization step in the final packaging. Terminal sterilization \nof a product provides greater assurance of sterility than from \nprocesses such as an aseptic process, which require individual \nproduct components to be sterilized separately and the final \npackage assembled in a sterile environment. \n\nTypically, in various embodiments, gamma radiation is \nused in the terminal sterilization step, which involves utiliz \ning ionizing energy from gamma rays that penetrates deeply \nin the device. Gamma rays are highly effective in killing \nmicroorganisms, they leave no residues nor have sufficient \nenergy to impart radioactivity to the device. Gamma rays can \nbe employed when the device is in the package and gamma \nsterilization does not require high pressures or vacuum con \nditions, thus, package seals and other components are not \nstressed. In addition, gamma radiation eliminates the need for \npermeable packaging materials. \n\nIn various embodiments, electronbeam (e-beam) radiation \nmay be used to sterilize one or more components of the \ndevice.  E-beam radiation  comprises a form of ionizing \nenergy, which is generally characterized by low penetration \nand high-dose rates. E-beam irradiation is similar to gamma \nprocessing in that it alters various chemical and molecular \nbonds on contact, including the reproductive cells of micro \norganisms. Beams produced for e-beam sterilization are con \ncentrated, highly-charged streams of electrons generated by \nthe acceleration and conversion of electricity. E-beam steril \nization may be used, for example, when the drug depot is \nincluded in a gel. \n\nOther methods may also be used to sterilize the depot \nand/or one or more components of the device, including, but \nnot limited to, gas sterilization, such as, for example, with \nethylene oxide or steam sterilization. \nKits \n\nIn various embodiments, a kit is provided comprising a \nplurality of implantable drug depots useful for reducing, pre \nventing or treating pain and inflammation in a patient in need \nof such treatment, the kit comprising a first set of the plurality \nof drug depots capable of releasing atherapeutically effective \nbolus dose of an analgesic and/or an anti-inflammatory agent \nor pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof at a site beneath \nthe skin and a second set of the plurality of drug depots \ncapable of releasing a therapeutically effective amount of the \nanalgesic and the anti-inflammatory agent or pharmaceuti \ncally acceptable salts thereof over a period of at least three \ndays. \n\nThe kit may include additional parts along with the drug \ndepot and/or medical device combined together to be used to \nimplant the drug depots (e.g., pellets, gel, etc.). The kit may \ninclude the drug depot device in a first compartment. The \nsecond compartment may include a canister holding the drug \ndepots or each drug depot with a different release profile may \nbe labeled and placed in a different compartment (e.g., bolus \ndose depot compartment, Sustained release depot compart \nment, etc.) and any other instruments needed for the localized \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n26 \ndrug delivery. A third compartment may include gloves, \ndrapes, wound dressings and other procedural Supplies for \nmaintaining sterility of the implanting process, as well as an \ninstruction booklet. A fourth compartment may include addi \ntional cannulas and/or needles. Each tool may be separately \npackaged in a plastic pouch that is radiation sterilized. A fifth \ncompartment may include an agent for radiographic imaging. \nA cover of the kit may include illustrations of the implanting \nprocedure and a clear plastic cover may be placed over the \ncompartments to maintain sterility. \nAdministration \n\nIn various embodiments, the analgesic agent and the anti \ninflammatory agent may be parenterally administered. The \nterm \u201cparenteral  as used herein refers to modes of adminis \ntration, which bypass the gastrointestinal tract, and include \nfor example, intravenous, intramuscular, continuous or inter \nmittent infusion, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, Subcutaneous, \nintra-operatively,  intrathecally,  intradiskally,  peridiskally, \nepidurally, perispinally, intraarticular injection or combina \ntions thereof. \n\nParenteral administration may additionally include, for \nexample, an infusion pump that administers a pharmaceutical \ncomposition (e.g., analgesic and anti-inflammatory combina \ntion) through a catheter near the spine or one or more inflamed \njoints, an implantable mini-pump that can be inserted at or \nnear the target site, an implantable controlled release device \nor Sustained release delivery system that can release a certain \namount of the composition per hour or in intermittent bolus \ndoses. One example of a suitable pump for use is the Syn \nchroMed R  (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn.) pump. This \npump has three sealed chambers. One contains an electronic \nmodule and battery. The second contains a peristaltic pump \nand drug reservoir. The third contains an inert gas, which \nprovides the pressure needed to force the pharmaceutical \ncomposition into the peristaltic pump. To fill the pump, the \npharmaceutical composition is injected through the reservoir \nfill port to the expandable reservoir. The inert gas creates \npressure on the reservoir, and the pressure forces the pharma \nceutical composition through a filterand into the pump cham \nber. The pharmaceutical composition is then pumped out of \nthe device from the pump chamber and into the catheter, \nwhich will direct it for deposit at the target site. The rate of \ndelivery of pharmaceutical composition is controlled by a \nmicroprocessor. This allows the pump to be used to deliver \nsimilar or different amounts of pharmaceutical composition \ncontinuously, at specific times, or at set intervals between \ndeliveries. \n\nPotential drug delivery devices suitable for adaptation for \nthe methods described herein include but are not limited to \nthose described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,551,290 \n(assigned to Medtronic, the entire disclosure is herein incor \nporated by reference), which describes a medical catheter for \ntarget specific drug delivery; U.S. Pat. No. 6,571,125 (as \nsigned to Medtronic, the entire disclosure is herein incorpo \nrated by reference), which describes an implantable medical \ndevice for controllably releasing a biologically active agent; \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,591,880 (assigned to Medtronic, the entire \ndisclosure  is  herein  incorporated  by  reference),  which \ndescribes an intraparenchymal infusion catheter system for \ndelivering therapeutic agents to selected sites in an organism; \nand U.S. Pat. No. 5,752.930 (assigned to Medtronic, the \nentire disclosure is herein incorporated by reference), which \ndescribes an implantable catheter for infusing equal Volumes \nof agents to spaced sites. In various embodiments, pumps \nmay be adapted with a pre-programmable implantable appa \nratus with a feedback regulated delivery, a micro-reservoir \nosmotic release system for controlled release of chemicals, \n\n\fUS 8,968,767 B2 \n\n27 \nSmall, light-weight devices for delivering liquid medication, \nimplantable microminiature infusion devices, implantable \nceramic valve pump assemblies, or implantable infusion \npumps with a collapsible fluid chamber. Alzet(R) osmotic \npumps (Durect Corporation, Cupertino, Calif.) are also avail \nable in a variety of sizes, pumping rates, and durations Suit \nable for use in the described methods. In various embodi \nments, a method for delivering a therapeutic agent at or near \nthe target tissue site of a patient is provided. The method \ncomprising inserting a cannula at or near a target tissue site \nand implanting the drug depot at the target site beneath the \nskin of the patient and brushing, dripping, injecting, or paint \ning the gel in the target site to hold or have the drug depot \nadhere to the target site. In this way unwanted migration of the \ndrug depot away from the target site is reduced or eliminated. \nIn various embodiments, because the combination of anal \ngesic and anti-inflammatory agent is locally administered, \ntherapeutically effective doses may be less than doses admin \nistered by other routes (oral, topical, etc.). In turn, systemic \nside effects, such as for example, liver transaminase eleva \ntions, hepatitis, liver failure, myopathy, constipation, etc. may \nbe reduced or eliminated. \n\nIn various embodiments, to administer the gel having the \ndrug depot dispersed therein to the desired site, first the can \nnula or needle can be inserted through the skin and Soft tissue \ndown to the target tissue site and the gel administered (e.g., \nbrushed, dripped, injected, or painted, etc.) at or near the \ntarget site.  In those embodiments where the drug depot is \nseparate from the gel, first the cannula or needle can be \ninserted through the skin and soft tissue down to the site of \ninjection and one or more base layer(s) of gel can be admin \nistered to the target site. Following administration of the one \nor more base layer(s), the drug depot can be implanted on or \nin the base layer(s) so that the gel can hold the depot in place \nor reduce migration. If required a Subsequent layer or layers \nof gel can be applied on the drug depot to Surround the depot \nand further hold it in place. Alternatively, the drug depot may \nbe implanted first and then the gel placed (e.g., brushed, \ndripped, injected, or painted, etc.) around the drug depot to \nhold it in place. By using the gel, accurate and precise implan \ntation of a drug depot can be accomplished with minimal \nphysical and psychological trauma to the patient. The gel also \navoids the need to Suture the drug depot to the target site \nreducing physical and psychological trauma to the patient. \n\nIn various embodiments, when the target site comprises a \nspinal region, a portion of fluid (e.g., spinal fluid, etc.) can be \nwithdrawn from the target site through the cannula or needle \nfirst and then the depot administered (e.g., placed, dripped, \ninjected, or implanted, etc.). The target site will re-hydrate \n(e.g., replenishment of fluid) and this aqueous environment \nwill cause the drug to be released from the depot. \n\nFIG. 4 illustrates a number of common locations within a \npatient that may be sites at which inflammation and/or pain \nmay occur. It will be recognized that the locations illustrated \nin FIG. 4 are merely exemplary of the many different loca \ntions within a patient that may be the sites of inflammation \nand/or pain.  For example, inflammation and/or pain may \noccur at a patient\u2019s knees 21, hips 22, fingers 23, thumbs 24. \nneck 25, and spine 26. \n\nOne exemplary embodiment where the depot is suitable for \nuse in pain management due to inflammation is illustrated in \nFIG. 5. Schematically shown in FIG. 5 is a dorsal view of the \nspine and sites where the drug depot may be inserted using a \ncannula or needle beneath the skin 34 to a spinal site 32 (e.g., \nspinal disc space, spinal canal, soft tissue Surrounding the \nspine, nerve root, etc.) and one or more drug depots 28 and 32 \nare delivered to various sites along the spine. In this way, \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n28 \nwhen several drug depots are to be implanted, they are \nimplanted in a manner that optimizes location, accurate spac \ning, and drug distribution. \n\nAlthough the spinal site is shown, as described above, the \ndrug depot can be delivered to any site beneath the skin, \nincluding, but not limited to, at least one muscle, ligament, \ntendon, cartilage, spinal disc, spinal foraminal space, near the \nspinal nerve root, or spinal canal. \n\nThe at least one analgesic agent and at least one anti \ninflammatory agent-based formulation may be used to form \ndifferent  pharmaceutical preparations  (e.g.,  drug depots, \ninjectable formulations, etc.). The pharmaceutical prepara \ntions may be formed in an administration with a suitable \npharmaceutical carrier that may be solid or liquid, and placed \nin the appropriate form for parenteral or other administration \nas desired. As persons of ordinary skill are aware, known \ncarriers include but are not limited to water, gelatin, lactose, \nstarches, Stearic acid, magnesium Stearate, Sicaryl alcohol, \ntalc, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, gums, waxes, propylene \nglycol, polyalkylene glycols and other known carriers. \n\nAnother embodiment provides a method for treating a \nmammal Suffering  from inflammation  and/or pain,  said \nmethod comprising administering a therapeutically effective \namount of at least one analgesic agent and at least one anti \ninflammatory agent at a target site beneath the skin at or near \nthe target site. The at least one analgesic agent and at least one \nanti-inflammatory agent may for example be administered \nlocally to the target tissue site as a drug depot. \n\nIn some embodiments, the therapeutically effective dosage \namount and the release rate profile are sufficient to reduce \ninflammation and/or pain for a period of at least one day, for \nexample, 1-90 days, 1-10 days, 1-3 days, 3-7 days, 3-12 days: \n3-14 days, 7-10 days, 7-14 days, 7-21 days, 7-30 days, 7-50 \ndays, 7-90 days, 7-140 days, or 14-140 days. \n\nIn some embodiments the at least one analgesic agent and \nat least one anti-inflammatory agent or a portion of the at least \none analgesic agent and at least one anti-inflammatory agent \nare administered as a bolus dose at the target tissue to provide \nan immediate release of the at least one analgesic agent and at \nleast one anti-inflammatory agent. \n\nIn some embodiments there is a composition useful for the \ntreatment of inflammation comprising an effective amount of \nat least one analgesic agent and at least one anti-inflammatory \nagent that is capable of being administered to e.g., a pain or \ninflammatory site. By way of example, they may be admin \nistered locally to the foraminal spine, the epidural space or the \nintrathecal space of a spinal cord. Exemplary administration \nroutes include but are not limited to catheter drug pumps, one \nor more local injections, polymer releases or combinations \nthereof. \n\nIn some embodiments, the at least one analgesic agent and \nat  least  one  anti-inflammatory  agent  are  administered \nparenterally, e.g., by injection. In some embodiments, the \ninjection is intrathecal, which refers to an injection into the \nspinal canal (intrathecal space Surrounding the spinal cord). \nAn injection may also be into a muscle or other tissue. In other \nembodiments, the analgesic agent and the anti-inflammatory \nagent is administered by placement into an open patient cav \nity during Surgery. \n\nIn some embodiments, the formulation is implantable at or \nnear a target tissue site at the time of Surgery. The active \ningredients may then be released from the depot via diffusion \nin a Sustained fashion over a period of time, e.g., 3-15 days, \n5-10 days or 7-10 days post surgery in order to address pain \nand inflammation. \n\nIn some embodiments, a desired release profile is main \ntained for at least three days, at least ten days, at least twenty \n\n\fUS 8,968,767 B2 \n\n29 \ndays, at least thirty days, at least forty days, at least fifty days, \nat least ninety days, at least one hundred days, at least one \nhundred and thirty-five days, at least one-hundred and fifty \ndays, or at least one hundred and eighty days. \n\nIn some embodiments, the drug depot may release 5%, \n10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, \n90%. 95%, or 99% of the at least one analgesic agent or \npharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and at least one anti \ninflammatory  agent  or  pharmaceutically  acceptable  salt \nthereof relative to a total amount of at least one analgesic \nagent or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and at least \none anti-inflammatory agent loaded in the drug depot over a \nperiod of at least three days, at least seven days, at least ten \ndays, at least twenty days, at least thirty days, at least forty \ndays, at least fifty days, at least ninety days, at least one \nhundred days, at least one-hundred and thirty-five days, at \nleast one-hundred and fifty days, or at least one hundred and \neighty days. In various embodiments, the analgesic will be \nreleased in an initial burst dose, then the analgesic will be \nreleased daily for 3 days and then stop (e.g., this will be \nSuitable to  reduce, prevent or treat, post-operative pain), \nwhile the anti-inflammatory agent will be released daily with \nout a burst dose for 3 to 12 days, 5 to 10 days or 7 to 10 days \nafter the drug depot is administered to the target tissue site. \nIn various embodiments, an implantable drug depot useful \nfor reducing, preventing or treating pain and inflammation is \nprovided in a patient in need of Such treatment, the implant \nable  drug  depot  comprising  a  therapeutically  effective \namount of an analgesic and an anti-inflammatory agent or \npharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof the depot being \nimplantable at a site beneath the skin to reduce, prevent or \ntreat pain and/or inflammation, wherein the drug depot (i) \ncomprises one or more immediate release layer(s) that is \ncapable of releasing about 5% to about 20% of the analgesic \nand the anti-inflammatory agent or pharmaceutically accept \nable salts thereof relative to a total amount of the analgesic \nand the anti-inflammatory agent or pharmaceutically accept \nable salts thereof loaded in the drug depot over a first period \nof up to 48 hours and (ii) one or more Sustain release layer(s) \nthat is capable of releasing about 21% to about 99% of the \nanalgesic and the anti-inflammatory agent or pharmaceuti \ncally acceptable salts thereof relative to a total amount of the \nanalgesic and the anti-inflammatory agent or pharmaceuti \ncally acceptable salts thereof loaded in the drug depot over a \nSubsequent period of up to 3 days to 6 months or 3 days to 2 \nweeks. \n\nBy way of non-limiting example, the target tissue site may \ncomprise at least one muscle, ligament, tendon, cartilage, \nspinal disc, spinal foraminal space near the spinal nerve root, \nfacet or spinal canal. The target tissue may be associated with \nan acute disease or chronic disease or Surgery. \n\nIn some embodiments, the at least one analgesic agent or \npharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and at least one anti \ninflammatory  agent  or  pharmaceutically  acceptable  salt \nthereof is encapsulated in a plurality of depots comprising \nmicroparticles, microspheres, microcapsules, and/or microfi \nbers Suspended in a gel. \n\nIn some embodiments, an implantable drug depot is pro \nvided, wherein the drug depot (i) comprises one or more \nimmediate release layer(s) that releases a bolus dose of at \nleast one analgesic agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salt \nthereof and at least one anti-inflammatory agent or pharma \nceutically acceptable salt thereofat a site beneath the skin and \n(ii) one or more Sustain release layer(s) that releases an effec \ntive amount of at least one analgesic agent or pharmaceuti \ncally acceptable salt thereof and at least one anti-inflamma \ntory agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof over a \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n30 \nperiod of 3 days to 6 months. By way of example, in the drug \ndepot, the one or more immediate release layer(s) may com \nprise poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and the one or more \nSustain release layer(s) may comprise polylactide \nMethod of Making \n\nIn various embodiments, the drug depot comprising the \nactive ingredients can be made by combining a biocompatible \npolymer and a therapeutically effective amount of the active \ningredients or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and \nforming the implantable drug depot from the combination. \n\nVarious techniques are available for forming at least a \nportion of a drug depot from the biocompatible polymer(s), \ntherapeutic agent(s), and optional materials, including solu \ntion processing techniques and/or thermoplastic processing \ntechniques. Where solution processing techniques are used, a \nSolvent system is typically selected that contains one or more \nSolvent species. The solvent system is generally a good sol \nvent for at least one component of interest, for example, \nbiocompatible polymer and/or therapeutic agent. The par \nticular solvent species that make up the solvent system can \nalso be selected based on other characteristics, including dry \ning rate and Surface tension. \nSolution processing techniques include solvent casting \ntechniques, spin coating techniques, web coating techniques, \nSolvent spraying techniques, dipping techniques, techniques \ninvolving coating via mechanical Suspension, including air \nSuspension (e.g., fluidized coating), inkjet techniques and \nelectrostatic techniques. Where appropriate, techniques such \nas those listed above can be repeated or combined to build up \nthe depot to obtain the desired release rate and desired thick \nCSS. \nIn various embodiments, a solution containing solvent and \nbiocompatible polymer are combined and placed in a mold of \nthe desired size and shape. In this way, polymeric regions, \nincluding barrier layers, lubricious layers, and so forth can be \nformed. If desired, the solution can further comprise, one or \nmore of the following: other therapeutic agent(s) and other \noptional additives such as radiographic agent(s), etc., in dis \nsolved or dispersed form. This results in a polymeric matrix \nregion containing these species after solvent removal. In other \nembodiments, a Solution containing solvent with dissolved or \ndispersed therapeutic agent is applied to a pre-existing poly \nmeric region, which can be formed using a variety of tech \nniques including solution processing and thermoplastic pro \ncessing  techniques,  whereupon the  therapeutic  agent  is \nimbibed into the polymeric region. \n\nThermoplastic  processing  techniques  for  forming the \ndepot or portions thereof include molding techniques (for \nexample,  injection  molding,  rotational  molding,  and so \nforth), extrusion techniques (for example, extrusion, co-ex \ntrusion, multi-layer extrusion, and so forth) and casting. \n\nThermoplastic  processing  in  accordance  with  various \nembodiments comprises mixing or compounding, in one or \nmore stages, the biocompatible polymer(s) and one or more \nof the following: the active ingredients, optional additional \ntherapeutic agent(s), radiographic agent(s), and so forth. The \nresulting mixture is then shaped into an implantable drug \ndepot. The mixing and shaping operations may be performed \nusing any of the conventional devices known in the art for \nSuch purposes. \n\nDuring thermoplastic processing, there exists the potential \nfor the therapeutic agent(s) to degrade, for example, due to \nelevated temperatures and/or mechanical shear that are asso \nciated with Such processing. For example, certain therapeutic \nagents may undergo Substantial degradation under ordinary \nthermoplastic processing conditions.  Hence, processing is \npreferably performed under modified conditions, which pre \n\n\fUS 8,968,767 B2 \n\n31 \nvent the Substantial degradation of the therapeutic agent(s). \nAlthough it is understood that some degradation may be \nunavoidable during thermoplastic processing, degradation is \ngenerally limited to 10% or less. Among the processing con \nditions that may be controlled during processing to avoid \nSubstantial degradation of the therapeutic agent(s) are tem \nperature, applied shear rate, applied shear stress, residence \ntime of the mixture containing the therapeutic agent, and the \ntechnique by which the polymeric material and the therapeu \ntic agent(s) are mixed. \n\nMixing or compounding biocompatible polymer with \ntherapeutic agent(s) and any additional additives to form a \nSubstantially homogenous mixture thereofmay be performed \nwith any device known in the art and conventionally used for \nmixing polymeric materials with additives. \n\nWhere thermoplastic materials are employed, a polymer \nmelt may be formed by heating the biocompatible polymer, \nwhich can be mixed with various additives (e.g., therapeutic \nagent(s), inactive ingredients, etc.) to form a mixture. A com \nmon way of doing so is to apply mechanical shear to a mixture \nof the biocompatible polymer(s) and additive(s). Devices in \nwhich the biocompatible polymer(s) and additive(s) may be \nmixed in this fashion include devices such as single screw \nextruders, twin screw extruders, banbury mixers, high-speed \nmixers, ross kettles, and so forth. \n\nAny of the biocompatible polymer(s) and various additives \nmay be premixed prior to a final thermoplastic mixing and \nshaping process, if desired (e.g., to prevent Substantial deg \nradation of the therapeutic agent among other reasons). \n\nFor example, in various embodiments, a biocompatible \npolymer is precompounded with a radiographic agent (e.g., \nradio-opacifying agent) under conditions of temperature and \nmechanical shear that would result in Substantial degradation \nof the therapeutic agent, if it were present. This precom \npounded material is then mixed with therapeutic agent under \nconditions of lower temperature and mechanical shear, and \nthe resulting mixture is  shaped into the active ingredient \ncontaining drug depot. Conversely, in another embodiment, \nthe biocompatible polymer can be precompounded with the \ntherapeutic agent under conditions of reduced temperature \nand mechanical shear. This precompounded material is then \nmixed with, for example, a radio-opacifying agent, also under \nconditions of reduced temperature and mechanical shear, and \nthe resulting mixture is shaped into the drug depot. \n\nThe conditions used to achieve a mixture of the biocom \npatible polymer and therapeutic agent and other additives will \ndepend on a number of factors including, for example, the \nspecific biocompatible polymer(s) and additive(s) used, as \nwell as the type of mixing device used. \n\nAs an example, different biocompatible polymers will \ntypically soften to facilitate mixing at different temperatures. \nFor instance, where a depot is formed comprising PLGA or \nPLA polymer, a radio-opacifying agent (e.g., bismuth Sub \ncarbonate), and a therapeutic agent prone to degradation by \nheat and/or mechanical shear (e.g.,  clonidine), in various \nembodiments, the PGLA or PLA can be premixed with the \nradio-opacifying agent attemperatures of about, for example, \n150\u00b0 C. to 170\u00b0 C. The therapeutic agent is then combined \nwith the premixed composition and subjected to further ther \nmoplastic  processing  at  conditions  of temperature  and \nmechanical shear that are substantially lower than is typical \nfor PGLA or PLA compositions. For example, where extrud \ners are used, barrel temperature, Volumetric output are typi \ncally controlled to limit the shear and therefore to prevent \nSubstantial  degradation  of the  therapeutic  agent(s).  For \ninstance, the therapeutic agent and premixed composition can \nbe mixed/compounded using a twin screw extruder at Sub \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n32 \nstantially lower temperatures (e.g., 100-105\u00b0C.), and using \nsubstantially reduced volumetric output less than 30% of full \ncapacity, which generally corresponds to a Volumetric output \nof less than 200 cc/min). It is  noted that this processing \ntemperature is well below the melting points of certain active \ningredients,  such  as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic \nbecause processing at or above these temperatures will result \nin Substantial therapeutic agent degradation. It is  further \nnoted that in certain embodiments, the processing tempera \nture will be below the melting point of all bioactive com \npounds within the composition, including the therapeutic \nagent. After compounding, the resulting depot is shaped into \nthe desired form, also under conditions of reduced tempera \nture and shear. \n\nIn other embodiments, biodegradable polymer(s) and one \nor more therapeutic agents are premixed using non-thermo \nplastic techniques. For example, the biocompatible polymer \ncan be dissolved in a solvent system containing one or more \nSolvent species. Any desired agents (for example, a radio \nopacifying agent, a therapeutic agent, or both radio-opacify \ning agent and therapeutic agent) can also be dissolved or \ndispersed in the solvents system. Solvent is then removed \nfrom the resulting Solution/dispersion, forming a solid mate \nrial. The resulting Solid material can then be granulated for \nfurther thermoplastic processing (for example, extrusion) if \ndesired. \n\nAs another example, the therapeutic agent can be dissolved \nor dispersed in a solvent system, which is then applied to a \npre-existing drug depot (the pre-existing drug depot can be \nformed using a variety of techniques including solution and \nthermoplastic processing techniques, and it can comprise a \nvariety of additives including a radio-opacifying agent and/or \nViscosity enhancing agent), whereupon the therapeutic agent \nis imbibed on or in the drug depot. As above, the resulting \nSolid material can then be granulated for further processing, if \ndesired. \n\nTypically, an extrusion processes may be used to form the \ndrug depot comprising a biocompatible polymer(s), thera \npeutic agent(s) and radio-opacifying agent(s). Co-extrusion \nmay also be employed, which is a shaping process that can be \nused to produce a drug depot comprising the same or different \nlayers or regions (for example, a structure comprising one or \nmore polymeric matrix layers or regions that have permeabil \nity  to  fluids  to  allow  immediate and/or Sustained  drug \nrelease). Multi-region depots can also be formed by other \nprocessing and shaping techniques such as co-injection or \nsequential injection molding technology. \n\nIn various embodiments, the depot that may emerge from \nthe thermoplastic processing (e.g., pellet, strip, etc.) is cooled. \nExamples of cooling processes include air cooling and/or \nimmersion in a cooling bath. In some embodiments, a water \nbath is used to cool the extruded depot. However, where a \nwater-soluble therapeutic agent Such as active ingredients are \nused, the immersion time should be held to a minimum to \navoid unnecessary loss of therapeutic agent into the bath. \n\nIn various embodiments, immediate removal of water or \nmoisture by use of ambient or warm air jets after exiting the \nbath will also prevent re-crystallization of the drug on the \ndepot Surface, thus controlling or minimizing a high drug \ndose \u201cinitial burst' or \u201cbolus dose  upon implantation or \ninsertion if this is release profile is not desired. Thus, a sus \ntained release  region of the drug depot may, in  various \nembodiments, be made by immediately removal of water or \nmoisture. \n\nIn various embodiments, the drug depot can be prepared by \nmixing or spraying the drug with the polymer and then mold \ning the depot to the desired shape.

The oral ingestion of pharmaceuticals is \nconsidered the safest, most convenient and most economical \nmethod of drug administration. As compared to present alter \nnatives, patient acceptance and adherence to a dosing regimen \nis typically higher among orally delivered pharmaceuticals. \nHowever, the oral delivery of many pharmaceuticals is not \npossible because the pharmaceuticals are either too large or \ntoo electrically charged to pass through the Small intestine to \nreach the bloodstream. In addition, many pharmaceuticals \nwhich are unable to withstand the environment of the diges \ntive tractor to penetrate the dermis need to be injected into the \npatient (e.g. insulin, proteins). \n\nIn order to overcome the problems associated with orally \ndelivered pharmaceuticals, transdermal drug delivery patches \nhave been developed. Transdermal drug delivery patches \nincorporate a medication and are intended to adhere to the \nskin of an individual.  Molecules of the medication pass \nthrough the skin and into the bloodstream of the individual \nthereby delivering a specific dose of medication. While func \ntional for their intended purposes, these patches have certain \ninherent limitations. By way of example, since the skin is a \nvery effect barrier, existing transdermal drug delivery patches \ncan only be used to deliver Small molecule drugs such as \nnicotine and birth control. Alternatively, other transdermal \ntechnologies have been developed that utilize pressurized gas \nor Voltage to move larger drug molecules across the skin \nbarrier into the bloodstream. Again, while functional for their \nintended purposes, use of these technologies are limited to \nSmaller Volume injections and may have the undesired effect \nofaltering the medications supplied to individuals. Therefore, \na transdermal drug delivery device that provides controlled \ninfusion of a drug to an individual without the use of pressur \nized gas or Voltage would constitute a significant advance \nment in the art. \n\nTherefore, it is a primary object and feature of the present \ninvention to provide a drug delivery device that provides \ncontrolled infusion of a drug to an individual without the use \nof pressurized gas or Voltage. \n\nIt is a further object and feature of the present invention to \nprovide a drug delivery device that provides controlled infu \nsion of a drug to an individual while maximizing the Volume \nof drug delivered. \n\nIt is a still further object and feature of the present invention \nto provide a drug delivery device that provides controlled \ninfusion of a drug to an individual that is simple to utilize and \ninexpensive to manufacture. \n\nIn accordance with the present invention, a drug delivery \nplatform is provided for delivering a controlled infusion of a \ndrug to an individual. The drug delivery platform includes a \nreservoir for receiving the drug therein and a pressure source \nengageable with the reservoir. The pressure source is movable \nbetween a first  configuration and a second configuration \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n2 \nwherein the pressure source exerts a pressure on the reservoir \nto urge the drug therefrom. An output conduit is provided for \ntransmitting the drug into the individual. An actuation mecha \nnism is operatively connected to the pressure source and the \noutput  conduit.  The  actuation  mechanism  is  movable \nbetween a non-actuated position and an actuated position \nwherein pressure source moves from the first configuration to \nthe second configuration and wherein the input of the output \nconduit communicates with the drug and the output end of the \noutput conduit is receivable in the individual. \n\nThe pressure source includes a hydrogel that expands in \nresponse to a predetermined stimulus, such as a fluid. The \ndrug delivery platform further includes an initiation fluid \nwherein the actuation mechanism includes an initiation con \nduit having an input and output. The input of the initiation \nconduit communicates with the initiation fluid and the output \nof the initiation conduit communicates with the pressure \nSource in response to the actuation mechanism in the actuated \nposition. A barrier is positioned between the initiation fluid \nand the pressure source. The barrier defines a channel net \nwork communicating with the pressure source and having an \ninput that communicates with the output of the initiation \nconduit in response to the actuation mechanism in the actu \nated position. A fluid diverter may be provided to direct fluid \nfrom the output of the initiation conduit to the channel net \nwork. The channel network includes a plurality of circular, \nconcentric channels. \n\nThe actuation mechanism includes a biasing structure for \nurging the actuation mechanism towards the non-actuated \nposition. The reservoir has first and second ends and includes \nan output adjacent the first end. The pressure source is posi \ntioned adjacent to the second end of the reservoir. \n\nIn accordance with a further aspect of the present inven \ntion, a drug delivery platform is provided for delivering a \ncontrolled infusion of a drug to an individual. The drug deliv \nery platform includes an initiation fluid and a reservoir for \nreceiving the drug therein. A pressure source is engageable \nwith the reservoir. The pressure source is movable between a \nfirst configuration and a second configuration wherein the \npressure source exerts a pressure on the reservoir to urge the \ndrug therefrom. An output conduit has an input and output, \nand an initiation conduit has an input and output. An initiation \nbutton is operatively connected to the output and initiation \nconduits. The initiation button is  movable between a non \nactuated position and an actuated position. With initiation \nbutton in the non-actuated position, the input of the initiation \nconduit is isolated from the initiation fluid and the output of \nthe initiation conduit is isolated from the pressure source. In \naddition, the input of the output conduit is isolated from the \ndrug and the output of the conduit is isolated from the indi \nvidual. With the initiation button in the actuated position, the \ninput of the initiation conduit communicates with the initia \ntion fluid and the output of the initiation conduit communi \ncates with the pressure source, and the input of the output \nconduit communicates with the drug and the output of the \noutput conduit is receivable in the individual. \n\nA barrier may be positioned between the initiation fluid \nand the pressure source. The barrier defines a channel net \nwork communicating with the pressure source and has an \ninput that communicates with the output of the initiation \nconduit in response to the initiation button in the actuated \nposition. A fluid diverter directs fluid from the output of the \ninitiation conduit to the channel network. The channel net \nwork may include a plurality of circular, concentric channels. \nThe drug delivery platform includes a biasing structure for \nurging the initiation button towards the non-actuated position. \nThe reservoir has first and second ends and includes an output \n\n\fUS 8,986,250 B2 \n\n3 \nadjacent the first end. The pressure source is positioned adja \ncent the second end of the reservoir. \n\nIn accordance with a still  further aspect of the present \ninvention, a drug delivery platform is provided for delivering \na controlled infusion of a drug to an individual. The drug \ndelivery platform includes a reservoir for receiving the drug \ntherein. The reservoir has a first end and a second end. An \nexpansion structure is positioned over the first end of the \nreservoir. The expansion structure has a first configuration \nand an expanded second configuration wherein the expansion \nstructure exerts a pressure on the reservoir to urge the drug \ntherefrom. An output conduit is movable between a retracted \nposition and an extended position. An actuation mechanism is \noperatively connected to the expansion structure and the out \nput conduit and is movable between a non-actuated position \nand an actuated position. The expansion structure moves from \nthe first configuration to the second configuration in response \nto the actuation mechanism moving to the actuated position. \nThe output conduit moves from the retracted position to the \nextended position to deliver the drug to the individual there \nthrough in response to actuation mechanism moving to the \nactuated position. \n\nThe expansion structure includes a hydrogel that expands \nin response to a predetermined stimulus, Such as an initiation \nfluid. The actuation mechanism includes an initiation conduit \nhaving an input and output. The input of the initiation conduit \ncommunicates with the initiation fluid and the output of the \ninitiation  conduit  communicates  with  the  hydrogel  in \nresponse to the actuation mechanism in the actuated position. \nA barrier is positioned between the initiation fluid and the \nexpansion structure. The barrier defines a channel network \ncommunicating with the expansion structure and having an \ninput that communicates with the output of the initiation \nconduit in response to the actuation mechanism in the actu \nated position. A fluid diverter directs fluid from the output of \nthe initiation conduit to the channel network. The channel \nnetwork includes a plurality of circular, concentric channels \nand the actuation mechanism includes a biasing structure for \nurging the actuation mechanism towards the non-actuated \nposition. \n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n\nThe drawings furnished herewith illustrate a preferred con \nstruction of the present invention in which the above advan \ntages and features are clearly disclosed as well as others \nwhich will be readily understood from the following descrip \ntion of the illustrated embodiments. \n\nIn the drawings: \nFIG. 1 is an isometric view of a drug delivery platform in \n\naccordance with the present invention; \n\nFIG. 2 is an exploded view of the drug delivery platform of \n\nthe present invention; \n\nFIG. 3 is an isometric view, sectioned in two different \nplanes, showing the drug delivery platform of the present \ninvention in a non-actuated position; \n\nFIG. 4 is an isometric view, sectioned in two different \nplanes, showing the drug delivery platform of the present \ninvention in an actuated position; \n\nFIG. 5 is a cross sectional view of the drug delivery plat \nform of the present invention taken along line 5-5 of FIG.3: \nFIG. 6 is a cross sectional view of the drug delivery plat \nform of the present invention taken along line 6-6 of FIG. 4; \nFIG. 7 is a cross sectional view of the drug delivery plat \nform of the present invention, similar to FIG. 5, with the \npressure source in an expanded configuration; \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n4 \nFIG. 8 is a cross sectional view of a middle insert for the \ndrug delivery platform of the present invention taken along \nline 8-8 of FIG. 2; \n\nFIG. 9 is a bottom, isometric view of the middle insert of \nthe drug delivery platform of the present invention taken from \na first side of the middle insert; and \n\nFIG. 10 is a bottom, isometric view of the middle insert of \nthe drug delivery platform of the present invention taken from \na second side of the middle insert. \n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n\nReferring to FIG. 1, a drug delivery platform in accordance \nwith the present invention is generally designated by the \nreference numeral 10.

In addition, \nlower surface 120 of ear portion 123 of cover 116 includes a \nconcave-shaped recess 128 for accommodating output end \n114 of bladder 108. Needle passageway 130 extends between \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n6 \nconcave-shaped recess 128 in lower surface 120 of cover 116 \nand upper surface 132 of cover 116, for reasons hereinafter \ndescribed. \n\nEar portion 123 of cover 116 further includes guide pas \nsageways 133 and 135 extending therethrough for accommo \ndating corresponding guide pins 21 and 23, respectively, for \nreasons hereinafter described. Needle passageway 138 and \nspring passageway 140 also extend through earportion 123 of \ncover 116 between upper and lower surfaces 132 and 120, \nrespectively. Needle passageway 138 is axially aligned with \nconcave-shaped recess 94 in upper surface 58 of middle insert \n56, while spring passageway 140 is  axially aligned with \nspring passageway 66 through ear portion 64 of middle insert \n56 and with circular recess 38 extending into upper surface 16 \nof ear portion 15 of base 12. Spring passageway 140 has a \ndiameter Sufficient to accommodate spring 42, for reasons \nhereinafter described. \n\nIn order to actuate drug delivery platform 10, initiation \nbutton 142 is provided. Initiation button 142 includes agen \nerally flat base 144 having an upper surface 146 and a lower \nsurface 148. Guide wall 150 depends from the outer periphery \nof base 142 and extends about the outer periphery of ear \nportion 123 of cover 116. Guide wall 150 includes recess 152 \ntherein so as to allow base portion 144 of initiation button 142 \nto partially overlap upper surface 132 of cover 116. Guide \npins 21 and 23 depend from lower surface 148 and are slid \nably received in corresponding guide passageways 133 and \n135, respectively, to guide movement of initiation button 142 \nbetween a non-actuated position, FIGS. 3 and 5, and an actu \nated position, FIGS. 4 and 6-7. It is noted that initiation button \n142 may include third guide pin 137, FIGS. 3-4, for further \nguiding movement of initiation button 142 between the non \nactuated and actuated positions. Cover 116 further includes \nfirst and second, generally tubular, needle supports 156 and \n158, respectively, depending from lower surface 148 of base \n144. First needle support 156 is adapted for receiving upper \nend 160 of initiation needle 162. First needle support 156 is \naxially aligned with and has a diameter less than needle \npassageway 130 through cover 116. As best seen in FIGS. \n5-7, initiation needle 162 includes an output 163 at lower end \n166 thereof and an input 164 centrally located between upper \nend 160 and lower end 166 thereof. \n\nSecond needle support 158 is adapted for receiving upper \nend 168 of output needle 170. Referring to FIGS. 3-4, output \nneedle 170 includes an output 172 at lower end 174 thereof \nand an input 176 at a location between upper end 168 and \nlower end 174 thereof. Output needle 170 extends through \nneedle passageway 138 in cover 116; needle passageway 67 \nthrough middle insert 56; output end 36 of bladder 26; and \nneedle passageway 25 through base 12. It can be appreciated \nthat the outer surface of output needle 170 and output end 36 \nof bladder 26 form a fluid-tight relationship for maintaining a \ndrug in bladder 26 when drug delivery device is not actuated, \nas hereinafter described. \n\nInitiation button 142 further includes a generally tubular \nspring retainer 178 depending from lower surface 148 of base \n144 and adapted for receiving upper end 180 of spring 42 \ntherein. Spring 42 passes through spring passageway 140 in \ncover 116; spring passageway 66 in middle insert 56; and into \nrecess 38 in base 12 about support post 39. As described, it \ncan appreciated that initiation button 142 is movable between \nthe first non-actuated position, FIGS. 3 and 5, and the second \nactuated position, FIGS. 4 and 6-7, against the bias of spring \n42. \n\nIn operation, the drug delivery platform 10 is assembled as \nheretofore described whereinbladder 108 is filled with a fluid \nto which hydrogel disc 44 is responsive and bladder 26 is \n\n\fUS 8,986,250 B2 \n\n10 \n\n7 \nfilled with a predetermined drug. Lower surface 22 of adhe \nsive pad 18 is affixed to an individual at a desired location so \nas to interconnect drug delivery platform 10 to the individual. \nReferring to FIGS. 3 and 5, with initiation button 142 in its \nnon-actuated state, input 164 of initiation needle 162 is iso-  5 \nlated from output end 114 of bladder 108 and such that output \n163 of initiation needle 162 is isolated from input 192 to \nrecess surface 84 of terminal surface 80 of middle insert56. In \naddition, with initiation button 142 in the non-actuated posi \ntion, input 176 of output needle 170 is isolated from output \nend 36 of bladder 26 and output 172 of output needle 170 is \nisolated from the individual to which the drug in bladder 26 is \nto be administered. \n\nReferring back to FIGS. 4 and 6, in order to actuate a drug \ndelivery platform 10, initiation button 142 is pressed against  15 \nthe bias of spring 42 such that initiation needle 162 pierces \noutput end 114 of bladder 108. As a result, input 164 of \ninitiation needle 162 communicates with the interior of blad \nder 108 via output end 114 and output 163 of initiation needle \n162 communicates with input channel 92 of recessed portion \n84 of terminal surface 80 in middle insert56. In addition, with \ninitiation button 142 in the actuated position, input 176 of \noutput needle 170 communicates with the interior of bladder \n26 through output end 36 and output 172 of output needle 170 \nis received within the individual to which the drug is to be \nadministered. \n\n25 \n\n40 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\nReferring to FIG. 7, with initiation button 142 in the actu \nated position, fluid flows from the interior of bladder 108 into \ninitiation needle 162 through input 164 thereof. The fluid \nexits initiation needle 162 through output 163 and flows onto \nrecessed portion 84 of terminal surface 80 through input \nchannel 92. Flow diverter 96 causes the fluid to flow about the \nentirety of recessed portion 84 of terminal surface 80 into \nspokes 86a-86b, thereby directing the fluid into flow channels \n82a and 82b. Thereafter, the fluid is distributed onto a sub \nstantial portion of upper Surface 46 of hydrogel disc 44 and \nabout the outer periphery thereof. In response, hydrogel disc \n44 expands thereby providing pressure onto bladder 26. Flow \ndiverter 96 acts to prevent hydrogel disc 44 from expanding in \nSuch a manner as to block input channel 92 and prevent \nadditional fluid from flowing onto recessed portion 84 of \nterminal surface 80 therethrough. As heretofore described, \nhydrogel disc 44 is positioned adjacent end 52 of bladder 26 \nSuch that expansion of hydrogel disc 44 urges the drug within \nbladder 56 toward output end 36 thereof. Under pressure, the 45 \ndrug flows from the output end 36 of bladder 26 into output \nneedle 70 through input 176thereof. Thereafter, the drug exits \noutput needle 170 through output 172 and is dispensed into \nthe individual. \n\nIt can be appreciated that since the rate of expansion of 50 \n\nhydrogel disc 44 controls the flow rate of the drug from \nbladder 26 into the individual, the desired delivery profiles \nSuch as bolus injections, constant infusion, delayed onset or \nthe like are possible simply by altering the chemistry of \nhydrogel disc 44. It can also be appreciated the output 172 of 55 \noutput needle 170 can be replaced with a microneedle array or \nlike without deviating from the scope of the present invention. \nVarious modes of carrying out the invention are contem \nplated as being within the scope of the following claims \nparticularly pointing and distinctly claiming the Subject mat-  60 \nter that is regarded as the invention. \n\nWe claim: \n1.

This application also claims priority to \nand the benefit of, and incorporates herein by reference in its \nentirety, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/234,742, \nwhich was filed on Aug. 18, 2009. \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\nTECHNICAL FIELD \n\nIn various embodiments, the invention relates to drug \ndelivery pumps. In particular, embodiments of the invention \nrelate  to  drug-delivery  pumps whose actuation  may be \ndynamically and adaptively controlled. \n\n25 \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nMedical treatment often requires the administration of a \ntherapeutic agent (e.g., medicament, drugs, etc.) to a particu \nlar part of a patient's body. As patients live longer and are \ndiagnosed with chronic and/or debilitating ailments,  the \nlikely result will be an increased need to place even more \nprotein therapeutics, Small-molecule drugs, and other medi \ncations into targeted areas throughout the patient\u2019s body. \nSome maladies, however, are difficult to treat with currently \navailable therapies and/or require administration of drugs to \nanatomical regions to which access is difficult to achieve. \n\nA patient\u2019s eye is a prime example of a difficult-to-reach \nanatomical region, and many vision-threatening diseases, \nincluding retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degen \neration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, are dif \nficult to treat with many of the currently available therapies. \nFor example, oral medications can have systemic side effects; \ntopical applications may sting and engender poor patient \ncompliance; injections generally require a medical visit, can \nbe painful, and risk infection; and Sustained-release implants \nmust typically be removed after their Supply is exhausted (and \ngenerally offer limited ability to change the dose in response \nto the clinical picture). \n\nAnother example is cancer, such as breast cancer or men \ningiomas, where large doses of highly toxic chemotherapies, \nSuch as rapamycin, bevacizumab (e.g., AVASTIN), or irino \ntecan (CPT-11), are typically administered to the patient \nintravenously, which may result in numerous undesired side \neffects outside the targeted area. Yet another example is drug \ndelivery to the knee, where drugs often have difficulty pen \netrating the avascular cartilage tissue for diseases such as \nosteoarthritis. \n\nImplantable  drug-delivery  devices  (e.g.,  drug-delivery \npumps), which may have a refillable drug reservoir, a cannula \nfor delivering the drug, a check valve, etc., generally allow for \ncontrolled delivery of pharmaceutical solutions to a specified \ntarget. As drug within the drug reservoir depletes, the physi \ncian can refill the reservoir with, for example, a Syringe, while \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n2 \nleaving the device implanted within the patient\u2019s body. This \napproach can minimize the Surgical  incision  needed for \nimplantation and typically avoids future or repeated invasive \nSurgery or procedures. \n\nImplantable drug-delivery pumps, particularly in ocular \napplications, often utilize a passive mechanism for drug \ndelivery (e.g., pumping the drug out when a finger is pressed \non the drug reservoir). One limitation of these conventional, \npassively-driven drug-delivery pumps is  their inability to \ndynamically respond to changes inside the pump (e.g., fail \nures, blockages, etc.) or to changes in the drug-delivery target \narea (e.g., increased pressure, bending of the pump's cannula, \ninflammation causing pressure around the cannula, etc.). The \nability to respond to Such changes can improve not only the \ntherapeutic value of a pump, but also safety. \n\nActive drug-delivery pumps, particularly feedback-driven \nones, represent a Substantial improvement over passively \ndriven pumps. Typically, these feedback-driven pumps are \nelectrically-driven  mechanical  pumps.  They  generally \nemploy controller units that receive inputs from sensors that \nmonitor the target treatment area and, in response, direct the \nrelease of a pharmaceutical or therapeutic agent to achieve a \ndesired result. The amount of drug released in each dosage \nperiod is thus largely determined by the current conditions of \nthe target area and is intended to be variable depending on \nwhat the conditions of the target area warrant. \n\nPharmaceutical treatment regimens may, however, require \nthat a drug be administered in fixed amounts at regular time \nintervals regardless of the changing conditions in the drug \ndelivery target area. Since the dosage levels produced by \nexisting closed-loop feedback-driven systems can be highly \ndependent on the parameters of the treatment area and thus \nprone to fluctuations, they are inadequate for delivering fixed \ndrug dosages at periodic intervals. For example, changes in \nthe conditions of the target area, such as blockages or other \nbiochemical or physiological events, may lead to variable \nlevels of drug being delivered to the target area. Accordingly, \nthere is a need for a feedback-driven pump that maintains the \ntarget dosage level despite such changes. \n\nFurthermore, while feedback based on the conditions of the \ntarget area is important in numerous therapeutic applications, \nerrors in drug administration can also arise from changing \nconditions within the pump itself. Conventional pumps gen \nerally do not account for Such changes, which can also lead to \nvariable amounts of drug being released. Accordingly, there is \nalso a need for a drug-delivery  pump that  dynamically \nresponds to changing conditions within the pump itself in \norder to, for example, consistently release a fixed dosage of \ndrug at periodic time intervals. \n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\nIn various embodiments, the present invention features an \nexternal or implantable drug-delivery pump that includes a \ndynamic, adaptive control system. The control system may \noperate the pump so as to release Substantially fixed amounts \nof pharmaceutical or therapeutic agents to a target treatment \narea at regular intervals. In certain embodiments, the control \nsystem continuously monitors (either directly or indirectly) \nconditions internal to the pump that have an effect on the \ndegree and duration of pump actuation and, consequently, the \namount of drug that is released. As used herein, the term \n\u201csubstantially\u2019 meansit 10% (e.g., by weight or by volume), \nand in some embodiments, t5%. \n\nIn one embodiment, the drug-delivery pump is an electro \nchemically-actuated pump. Such as an electrolysis-driven \npump. Electrochemically-actuated pumps, as compared to \n\n\fUS 9,283,322 B2 \n\n3 \nelectrically-driven mechanical pumps, offer several advan \ntages for drug-delivery systems. For example, they generally \nhave few moving parts, which enables them to be small and \nportable, and which makes them less prone to mechanical \nbreakdown than electrically-driven  mechanical pumps. In \nparticular, electrochemically-actuated pumps are Suitable for \nenvironments that require Small pump sizes, such as the ocu \nlar environment. As further described herein, an electrolysis \ndriven pump generally employs electrodes to generate an \nelectrochemically active gas that variably pressurizes a drug \ncontained in a separate chamber in order to dispense the drug \nin  a controlled  fashion.  The amount of drug dispensed \ndepends on the gas pressure variably generated by the pump \nactuator, which in turn depends on the current that passes \nthrough the electrodes. Because of the inherent variability in \nthese electrolysis-driven pumps (e.g., the Volume of gas and/ \nor the amount of electrolyte can change between every pump \ncycle), the adaptive control design described herein can con \nfer Substantial advantages, as further explained below. \n\nIn general, in one aspect, embodiments of the invention \nfeature a drug-delivery pump that includes a drug reservoir, a \ncannula for conducting liquid from the reservoir to a target \nsite, a pump actuator for forcing the liquid from the reservoir \nthrough the cannula, and circuitry for controlling the actuator \nbased on a change in a condition of the pump. \n\nIn general, in another aspect, embodiments of the invention \nfeature a method of delivering a drug to a patient using Such \na drug-delivery pump. The method involves establishing fluid \ncommunication between the drug reservoir and the patient \n(i.e., the target site) and controlling the pump actuator based \non a change in a condition of the pump so as to deliver a \ndosage of liquid from the drug reservoir into the patient. \n\nIn various embodiments, the control circuitry maintains \ndelivery of a substantially fixed dosage of the liquid at peri \nodic time intervals to the target site. Moreover, the circuitry \nmay include memory for storing the conditions of the pump at \nthe time of previous delivery events (e.g., at the time of each \ndelivery interval).  In  one embodiment, the drug-delivery \npump includes a flow sensor for measuring a flow rate of the \nliquid through the cannula and into the patient, and the cir \ncuitry controls the pump actuator based, at least in part, on an \nanalysis of the flow rate. The circuitry may also control the \nactuator based on the stored conditions of the pump from the \nprevious doses and/or on real-time data from the actuator. In \nanother embodiment, the control circuitry maintains delivery \nof a Substantially fixed dosage of the liquid over time through \ncontinuous infusion to the target site. \n\nAs mentioned, the drug-delivery pump may be an elec \ntrolysis-driven pump. More particularly, the pump actuator \nmay include an electrolyte chamber, an expandable dia \nphragm that separates the electrolyte chamber from the drug \nreservoir and provides a fluid barrier therebetween, and elec \ntrolysis electrodes that cause evolution of a gas in the elec \ntrolyte chamber. The evolution of the gas expands the dia \nphragm so that the liquid is forced from the drug reservoir into \nthe cannula. In various embodiments, the diaphragm expan \nsion is adjusted by varying the actuation current Supplied to \nthe electrodes. In other embodiments, the diaphragm expan \nsion is adjusted by varying an actuation duration of the elec \ntrodes. As described herein, the electrolysis electrodes may \nbe driven with either a constant current or a time-varying \ncurrent waveform. \n\nIn general, in yet another aspect, embodiments of the \ninvention feature a drug-delivery pump that includes a drug \nreservoir, an electrolyte chamber, electrolysis electrodes, an \nexpandable diaphragm that separates the electrolyte chamber \nfrom the drug reservoir and provides a fluid barrier therebe \n\n4 \ntween, a cannula for conducting liquid from the drug reser \nVoir to a target site, and circuitry for adjusting expansion of \nthe diaphragm based on conditions of the target site (e.g., \nchanges in one or more biochemical parameters of the target \nsite, in electrical activity at the target site, and/or in pressure \nat the target site). The pump may include a sensor for detect \ning such conditions. For their part, the electrolysis electrodes \nmay be activated to cause evolution of a gas in the electrolyte \nchamber, which expands the diaphragm So that the liquid is \nforced from the drug reservoir into the cannula. \n\nIn general, in still  another aspect, embodiments of the \ninvention feature a drug-delivery pump that includes a drug \nreservoir, a cannula for conducting liquid from the reservoir \nto a target site, a pump actuator for forcing the liquid from the \nreservoir through the cannula, and circuitry for controlling \nthe actuator. In particular, the circuitry controls the actuatori) \nto initially deliver a substantially fixed dosage of the liquid at \nperiodic time intervals to the target site, and ii) to compensate \nfor a change in a condition of the pump so as to maintain or \nresume the delivery of the substantially fixed dosage of the \nliquid at the periodic time intervals to the target site. \n\nIn general, in a further aspect, embodiments of the inven \ntion feature a method of delivering a drug to a patient from a \ndrug-delivery pump that includes a drug reservoir and a pump \nactuator for forcing liquid from the reservoir into the patient. \nThe  method  involves  establishing  fluid  communication \nbetween the drug reservoir and the patient, and controlling the \npump actuator. In particular, the actuator is controlled i) to \ninitially deliver a substantially fixed dosage of the liquid at \nperiodic time intervals  from the drug reservoir  into  the \npatient, and ii) to compensate for a change in a condition of \nthe pump so as to maintain or resume the delivery of the \nSubstantially fixed dosage of the liquid at the periodic time \nintervals into the patient. \n\nThese and other objects, along with advantages and fea \ntures of the embodiments of the present invention herein \ndisclosed, will become more apparent through reference to \nthe following description, the accompanying drawings, and \nthe claims. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the fea \ntures of the various embodiments described herein are not \nmutually exclusive and can existin various combinations and \npermutations, even if not made explicit herein. \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n\nIn the drawings, like reference characters generally refer to \nthe same parts throughout the different views. Also, the draw \nings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead generally \nbeing placed upon illustrating the principles of the invention. \nIn the following description, various embodiments of the \npresent invention are described with reference to the follow \ning drawings, in which: \n\nFIG.  1  schematically  illustrates,  in  cross-section,  an \nimplantable drug-delivery pump in  accordance with one \nembodiment of the invention; \n\nFIG.  2  schematically  illustrates,  in  cross-section,  an \nimplantable drug-delivery pump in accordance with another \nembodiment of the invention; \n\nFIG. 3 is a block diagram of a drug-delivery pump in \n\naccordance with one embodiment of the invention; \n\nFIG. 4 is a graph representing an example of how each of \nthe drug-delivery pumps depicted in FIGS. 1-3 may adapt to \nchanging conditions within the pump to deliver a target dos \nage level; \n\nFIG. 5A illustrates exemplary flow and actuation profiles \n\nof a pump that operates without feedback control; \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n\fUS 9,283,322 B2 \n\n5 \nFIG.5B illustrates exemplary flow and actuation profiles of \na pump whose actuator is actuated for a longer period of time \nas the pump's efficiency decreases; \n\nFIG.5C illustrates exemplary flow and actuation profiles of \na pump whose actuation current is increased as the pump's \nefficiency decreases; and \n\nFIG. 6 is a sectional view of a patient\u2019s eye illustrating \nimplantation therein of a drug-delivery pump in accordance \nwith one embodiment of the invention. \n\nDESCRIPTION \n\nIn general, embodiments of the present invention pertain to \nexternal or implantable drug-delivery pumps (whether they \nbe reusable and refillable pumps, disposable pumps, etc.) \nwhose actuation may be dynamically and adaptively con \ntrolled.  For example, embodiments of the drug-delivery \npumps may be implantable within a patient\u2019s body, such as \nwithin the patient\u2019s eye or brain. In certain embodiments, the \nimplantable drug-delivery pumps combine Small size and a \nrefillable drug reservoir. The small size minimizes discomfort \nfrom the drug-delivery pump to the patient, while the refill \nable reservoir allows the pump to be refilled in situ, rather \nthan having to be replaced. As such, a fluid, such as a Solution \nof a drug, can be Supplied to the patient over extended periods \nof time. \nA. Exemplary Drug-Delivery Pump \n\nEmbodiments of the invention may be employed in con \nnection with various types of drug-delivery pumps, whether \nthey be external pumps or pumps implantable within  a \npatient\u2019s body. FIGS. 1 and 2 schematically illustrate two \nvariations of an exemplary implantable drug-delivery pump \n100 (namely, an exemplary electrolytic or electrolysis-driven \npump 100) implanted within a patient\u2019s eye 104. The pump \n100 may, however, instead be implanted in other portions of a \npatient\u2019s body. For example, it may be implanted in the sub \narachnoid space of the brain to provide chemotherapy or to \nprovide another type of treatment for the brain (e.g., by dos \ning the brain's parenchyma directly); near a tumor in any \nportion of the patient\u2019s body to provide chemotherapy; in a \npancreas that does not respond well to glucose to provide \nagents (e.g., proteins, viral  vectors, etc.) that will trigger \ninsulin release; external to a patient but with a cannula placed \nunder the skin or inside the abdominal cavity to deliver insu \nlin; in the knee to provide drugs that will treat osteoarthritis or \nother cartilage diseases; near the spine to provide pain medi \ncations or anti-inflammatories; or elsewhere. \n\nAs illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, embodiments of the pump \n100 may include two main components: a pair of chambers \n108, 112 surrounded, at least in part, by a wall 115, and a \ncannula 120. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the wall 115 that sur \nrounds the chambers 108, 112 may include or consist of a \nstand-alone parylene film 116 and, thereover, a separate pro \ntection shell 128 made of a relatively rigid biocompatible \nmaterial (e.g., medical-grade polypropylene). Alternatively, \nas illustrated in FIG. 2, the wall 115 may correspond only to \nthe protective shell 128, which may be coated with parylene. \nThe top chamber 108 defines a drug reservoir that, when \nbeing used to treat a patient, may contain the drug to be \nadministered in liquid form. For its part, the bottom chamber \n112 may contain a liquid that, when Subjected to electrolysis, \nevolves a gaseous product. For example, that liquid may be \nwater, which may be electrolytically separated by an applied \nVoltage into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. Alternatively, as \nother examples, the electrolyte liquid may be a saline Solution \n(i.e., NaCl in HO) or a solution that contains either magne \nsium sulfate or sodium sulfate. In one embodiment, the two \n\n6 \nchambers 108, 112 are separated by a corrugated diaphragm \n124. In other words, the diaphragm 124 provides a fluid \nbarrier between the two chambers 108, 112. Like the stand \nalone film 116, the diaphragm 124 may be constructed from, \nfor example, parylene. \n\nAs illustrated in FIG.1, the stand-alone film 116 may act as \nan outer barrier for the drug reservoir 108 and the protective \nshell 128 may provide a hard surface against which the film \n116 exerts pressure. In such a case, the shell 128 may be \nperforated to allow for eye, brain, or other bodily fluid move \nment. Alternatively, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the protective \nshell  128 may itself act as the outer barrier for the drug \nreservoir 108 and be unperforated. In both embodiments \ndepicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, the protective shell 128 may \nprevent outside pressure from being exerted on the drug res \nervoir 108. As illustrated in FIG. 1, a bottom portion 126 (i.e., \na floor 126) of the protective shell 128 may include suture \nholes 130. Similarly, although not shown in either FIG. 1 or \nFIG. 2, the cannula 120 may also include suture holes along \nits sides. The suture holes 130 may be employed in suturing \n(i.e., anchoring) the pump 100 in place in the patient\u2019s body. \nAs also illustrated in FIG. 1, to provide power to the pump \n100 and to enable data transmission therewith, a battery and \ncontrol circuitry 132 may be embedded (e.g., hermetically \nsealed) under the chambers 108, 112 (i.e., between a bottom \nportion of the stand-alone parylene film 116 of the drug \nreservoir 108 and the floor 126 of the protective shell 128), \nand an induction coil 136 may be integrated in the protective \nshell 128 (e.g., by injection molding). FIG. 2 more clearly \nillustrates a hermetic case 135 for housing the battery and \nconventional control circuitry 132, but, for simplicity, does \nnot depict the components housed therein. The hermetic case \n135 may be made from biocompatible metals (e.g., titanium) \nor metal alloys. The bottom of the hermetic case 135 may be \nflat, or it may be concave to help the implantable pump 100 fit \non the patient\u2019s eye 104. \n\nIn one embodiment, the induction coil 136 permits wireless \n(e.g.,  radio-frequency)  communication  with  an  external \ndevice (e.g., a handset). The handset may be used to send \nwireless signals to the control circuitry 132 in order to pro \ngram, reprogram, operate, calibrate, or otherwise configure \nthe pump 100. In one embodiment, the control circuitry 132 \ncommunicates electrically with electrolysis electrodes 134 in \nthe electrolyte chamber 112 by means of metal interconnects \n(vias) 138 spanning a bottom portion of the electrolyte reser \nvoir 112. The electrolysis electrodes 134 may be made from, \nfor example, platinum, gold, and/or other metal(s). As further \ndescribed below, the control circuitry 132 controls the pump \ning action of the pump 100, including the below-described \nclosed-loop control process. \n\nIn one embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 1, the cannula \n120 connects the drug reservoir 108 to a check valve 140 \ninserted at the site of administration. The check valve 140 \nmay be a one-way check valve that prevents the backflow of \nany fluid into the drug reservoir 108. Alternatively, or in \naddition, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the check valve 140 may be \nintegral with and located at a proximal end of the cannula 120 \n(i.e.,  at the end closest to the drug reservoir 108). More \ngenerally, however, the check valve 140 may be located any \nwhere along the cannula 120. In addition, one or more flow \nsensors 144 for monitoring the flow of the drug, and thereby \nenabling the measurement of the drug Volume delivered and/ \nor the flow rate of the drug through the cannula 120, may be \nassociated with one or more of a proximal, middle, or distal \nportion of the cannula 120. Optionally, as illustrated in FIG.1. \none or more target site sensor(s) 148 may also be integrated at \na distal end of the cannula 120 (i.e., at the end furthest from \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n\fUS 9,283,322 B2 \n\n7 \nthe drug reservoir 108) in order to measure one or more \nparameters at the site of administration (e.g., the intravitreal \nchamber, shoulder capsule, knee capsule, cerebral Ventricals, \nspinal canal, etc.). For example, the target site sensor(s) 148 \nmay be employed to sense one or more of a change in a \nbiological or biochemical parameter at the target site (e.g., a \nchange in a specific analyte concentration, the presence or \nabsence of a specific biochemical marker, etc.), a change in \nelectrical activity at the target site (which may, for example, \nbe brought on by a physiological change), and a change in \npressure at the target site. In one embodiment, the target site \nsensor(s)  148 provide feedback (i.e.,  real-time measure \nments) to the control circuitry 132 so that the flow of drug may \nbe metered by a closed-loop control process. For example, \nincreased pressure in the drug target region may warrant a \ndecrease in the flow of drug from the pump 100. \n\nAs illustrated in FIG. 1, the cannula 120 may be an exten \nsion of the stand-alone parylene film 116. Alternatively, as \nillustrated in FIG. 2, the cannula 120 may be a separate \ncomponent (e.g., a parylene component) that is coupled to the \nprotective shell 128. For example, a proximal end of the \ncannula 120 may be inserted through a fluid connection port \nformed in the protective shell 128 and bonded thereto by way \nof e.g., a biocompatible epoxy glue 150. A silicone sheath \n154 may be placed around a portion of the cannula 120 (see \nFIG. 2), but this is optional (see FIG. 1). \n\nIn one embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 1, a fill port 152 \nis assembled with the drug reservoir 108 and sealed by a \nsealant (e.g., a biocompatible epoxy) 156 to the stand-alone \nfilm 116 and protective shell 128. In yet another embodiment, \nas illustrated in FIG. 2, a hole may be formed through the \nprotective shell 128 and the fill port 152 featured therein. In \nstill another embodiment, the fill port 152 may be formed \nelsewhere on the pump 100 and be connected to the drug \nreservoir 108 through tubing. For example, the fill port 152 \nmay be molded from biocompatible materials, coupled to a \nmatching notch on the hermetic case 135, and connected to \nthe drug reservoir 108 through the tubing. In one embodi \nment, the tubing is inserted through a fluid connection port \nformed in a wall surrounding the drug reservoir 108 and \nbonded thereto by way of a biocompatible epoxy glue. In \neither case, the fill port 152 is in fluid communication with the \ndrug reservoir 108 and permits an operator of the pump 100 \n(e.g., a physician) to refill the drug reservoir 108 in situ (e.g., \nwhile the pump 100 is implanted within the patient\u2019s eye \n104). In general, the drug reservoir 108 can be refilled by \ninserting a refill needle into and through the fill port 152. \n\nIn various embodiments, the main parts of the pump 100 \n(i.e., the pair of chambers 108, 112 and the cannula 120) are \namenable to  monolithic  microfabrication  and integration \nusing multiple parylene layer processes. The fill port 152, the \nprotective shell 128, and other components may be assembled \nwith the pump 100 after the microfabrication steps. \n\nIn operation, when current is Supplied to the electrolysis \nelectrodes 134, the electrolyte evolves gas, expanding the \ncorrugated diaphragm 124 (i.e., moving the diaphragm 124 \nupwards in FIGS. 1 and 2) and forcing liquid (e.g., drug) out \nof the drug reservoir 108, into and through the cannula 120, \nand out the distal end thereof to the targeted site of adminis \ntration. The corrugations or other folds in the expandable \ndiaphragm 124 permit a large degree of expansion, without \nsacrificing volume within the drug reservoir 108 when the \ndiaphragm 124 is relaxed. When the current is stopped, the \nelectrolyte gas condenses back into its liquid State, and the \ndiaphragm 124 recovers its space-efficient corrugations. \nB. Adaptive Control Based Upon Internal Pump Conditions \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n8 \nIn general, the response of the electrolysis-driven pump \n100 to a given input current supplied to the electrolysis elec \ntrodes 134 depends on how much liquid is remaining in the \ndrug reservoir 108. For example, if the drug reservoir 108 is \nnearly empty, more current is needed to bring the drug reser \nvoir 108 to its \u201cfull  configuration before pressure can begin \nto buildup and pumping can commence. On the other hand, if \nthe drug reservoir 108 is completely full, very little current is \nneeded before delivery of the drug begins. Similarly, the \nresponse of the electrolysis-driven pump 100 to a given input \ncurrent also depends on the gas/liquid ratio in the electrolysis \nchamber 112. In particular, the response of the pump 100 will \nbe very different when the drug reservoir 108 is full with drug \n(e.g., when the electrolysis chamber 112 operates with a low \ngas/liquid ratio) than when the drug reservoir 108 is nearly \nempty (e.g., when the electrolysis chamber 112 operates with \na high gas/liquid ratio). In addition, other factors can cause \nthe response of the electrolysis-driven pump 100 to change \nover time including, for example, degradation of the elec \ntrolysis electrodes 134, changes in the concentration of the \nelectrolyte in the electrolysis chamber 112, changes in the \nflow characteristics of the check valve 140, and restrictions \nthat format the output of the cannula 120 due to tissue growth \nor some other mechanism. \n\nBecause of these factors, the electrolysis pump 100 is \ninherently variable. Accordingly, adaptive control in accor \ndance herewith can confer Substantial advantages upon the \npump 100. For example, as further explained below, by ana \nlyzing  previous  doses  to  ascertain  how the  pump 100 \nresponded to given input currents, the optimal settings (e.g., \nthe settings which give the most accurate and shortest dose) \nfor the current dose can be derived. This can be particularly \nbeneficial when the dose volume is small compared to the \nvolume of the drug reservoir 108. In such a situation, the state \nparameters of the pump 100 (e.g., the drug Volume remaining \nin the drug reservoir 108, the liquid/gas ratio in the electroly \nsis chamber 112, the condition of the electrodes 134, the \ncharacteristics of the check valve 140, etc.) are nearly iden \ntical from one dose to the immediately following dose, and, as \nSuch, the previous doses are an excellent predictor for the \ncurrent dose. \n\nFIG.3 is a block diagram of a drug-delivery pump 200 that \ndepicts the control circuitry 132 in greater detail. The drug \ndelivery pump 200 may be any type of external or internal \npump having an actuator 204 that forces the liquid from the \ndrug reservoir 108 into and through the cannula 120. For \nexample, the drug-delivery pump 200 may be an electrolysis \ndriven pump and, with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2 described \nabove, the pump actuator 204 may include the electrolyte \nchamber 112, the expandable diaphragm 124, and the elec \ntrolysis electrodes 134. For its part, the control circuitry 132 \nincludes computer memory 208 for storing one or more con \nditions of the pump 200, and an adaptive controller 212 for \ncontrolling the pump actuator 204 based on a change in a \ncondition of the pump 200. Optionally, the control circuitry \n132 may also include one or more module(s) to convert raw \ndata received from the flow sensor 144 into a meaningful \nvalue (e.g.,  into a flow rate in nL/min) and/or to convert \nsimilarly raw data received from the pump actuator 204 into \na meaningful value. Alternatively, the functions performed by \nsuch module(s) may instead be performed by the adaptive \ncontroller 212. \n\nThe computer memory 208 may be implemented as any \ntype of Volatile or non-volatile (e.g., Flash) memory, while \nthe adaptive controller 212 and/or the module(s) described \nabove may each be implemented as any software program, \nhardware device, or combination thereof that is capable of \n\n\fUS 9,283,322 B2 \n\nproviding the functionality described herein. For example, \nthe adaptive controller 212 and/or the module(s) described \nabove may each be an application-specific integrated circuit \n(ASIC) or a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Alterna \ntively, the adaptive controller 212 may be implemented using \na general-purpose microprocessor (e.g., any of the PEN \nTIUM microprocessors supplied by Intel Corp.) that is pro \ngrammed using any suitable programming language or lan \nguages (e.g., C++, C#, Java, Visual Basic, LISP, BASIC, \nPERL, etc.). Suitable control programming is straightfor \nwardly implemented by those of skill in the art without undue \nexperimentation. \n\nIn one particular embodiment, as further described below, \nthe control circuitry 132 is programmed to deliver a fixed \ndosage of the drug from the drug reservoir 108 to the target \nsite at periodic time intervals, and is configured to store the \nconditions of the pump 200 at each of those time intervals in \nthe computer memory 208. Some exemplary and non-limit \ning conditions internal to the pump 200 that may be stored at \neach dosing interval (or at other periodic intervals) include \nthe current through, Voltage across, or resistance of the elec \ntrolysis electrodes 134; the total electrical charge used to \ndrive the electrolysis electrodes 134; the maximum flow rate \nof the drug through the cannula 120; any variations in flow \npatterns of the drug through the cannula 120; the actuation \ntime required for the pump 200 to achieve a particular flow \nrate of the drug through the cannula 120; the time required for \nthe flow of drug to ramp down from a particular flow rate to a \nflow rate of Zero; the time delay between the initial actuation \nof the pump 200 and the initial flow of drug through the \ncannula 120; the efficiency of the pump actuator 204 (which, \nin the case of an electrolysis-driven pump 200, may be \ndefined as the ratio between the amount of charge pumped \nthrough the actuator 204 and the amount of gas generated \nthereby); the internal pressure of the drug reservoir 108; the \nacceleration experienced by the pump 200;  flow  sensor \nparameters particular to the flow sensor 144 architecture (e.g., \nwhere the flow sensor 144 is a resistive temperature detector, \nthe resistance of the sensor and heater elements may be \nstored); and the physical dimensions of the pump actuator \n204, the drug reservoir 108, and/or the cannula 120, which \nmay change due to blockages, Scarring, or other biochemical/ \nphysiological events. \n\nIn one embodiment, these parameters are measured either \ndirectly or indirectly by using physical sensors, such as, for \nexample, the flow sensor(s) 144, pressure sensors in the drug \nreservoir 108 or cannula 120, accelerometers, gyroscopes, \naltimeters, sensors in proximity to the electrolysis electrodes \n134 (to measure, for example, their resistance, the current \npassing therethrough, and/or the Voltage thereat or there \nacross), or any other sensor dispersed throughout the pump \n200. In other embodiments, these parameters are determined \nby using known relationships. For example, the flow rate of \nthe drug through the cannula 120 may be determined by using \na pressure sensor in the cannula 120 and by utilizing the \nwell-known linear relationship between pressure and flow \nrate. In still other embodiments, many of these parameters \nmay ascertained by analyzing the electrical waveforms used \nto drive the pump actuator 204, and/or by analyzing the flow \nprofiles sensed by the flow sensor(s) 144. \n\nIn all cases, as further described below, the adaptive con \ntroller 212 of the control circuitry 132 can receive and process \nthis parameter data and compensate for any change in a con \ndition of the pump 200 in order to adjust its operation to \nmaintain a target dosage level. This \u201cself-compensation' may \nbe achieved by storing, as mentioned above, parameter data \nfrom the pump 200 state at the time of the previous dosages \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n10 \nand by considering real-time parameter values to determine \nthe optimal actuation current for the electrolysis electrodes \n134 and/or their actuation duration at the next dosing event. \nFor example, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the adaptive controller \n212 may receive, analyze, and process the stored parameters \nfrom previous doses, real-time data from the pump actuator \n204, and real-time data from the flow sensor(s) 144 (e.g., flow \nrate data) to ascertain and direct appropriate output signals to \nthe pump actuator 204 (i.e., in order to drive the pump 200 in \nthe appropriate manner). For initial dosing, or in cases where \nthe above-described data may be unavailable (e.g., due to a \nreset action in the pump 200), the adaptive controller 212 may \nemploy a set of pre-defined reference parameter values. These \nreference values may be specific to the characteristics of the \nparticular pump 200 employed, for example specific to the \ntypes of electrolysis electrodes 134 employed, the type of \nelectrolytic solution used, and/or the physical dimensions of \nthe pump actuator 204, drug reservoir 108, and cannula 120. \nIn one mode of operating an electrolysis-driven pump 200, \nthe electrolysis electrodes 134 are driven using a constant \ncurrent for a variable amount of time. In this mode, the con \nstant current results in a monotonic rise in the flow rate of the \ndrug through the cannula 120 until the current is shut off, at \nwhich point the residual pressure in the pump 200 gives rise \nto a slow decay in the flow rate until the flow rate reaches zero. \nIn one functional example for this mode of operation, the \nfollowing  three  parameters  are  stored  in  the  computer \nmemory 208 at each dosing interval: the current supplied to \nthe electrolysis electrodes 134 in order to drive the pump 200 \n(I); the maximum flow rate of the drug through the cannula \n120 (F); and the Volume of liquid (i.e., drug) that is deliv \nered by the pump 200, due to residual pressure, after the pump \nactuator 204 is deactivated (V). This stored information \nis then used, in future doses, to improve the dosing speed and \naccuracy. For example, the current used to drive future doses \nmay be adjusted based on previous dose data (e.g., increased \nif the maximum flow rate is too low, and decreased if the \nmaximum flow rate is too high) in order to keep the duration \nof each dose, and the volume of the drug delivered on each \ndose, relatively consistent. In one embodiment, this is done in \na linear fashion as follows: \n\nXI \n\nnaxprevious  previous \n\nI \nFootina/ \ncurrent \nop \nwhere I \nis the current to be supplied to the electrolysis \nis the desired \nelectrodes 134 during the current dose, F \nmaximum flow rate of the drug through the cannula 120, \nF, \nwas the maximum flow rate of the drug through \nthe cannula 120 during the previous dose, and I \nwas the \ncurrent supplied to the electrolysis electrodes 134 during the \nprevious dose. \n\nAs another example, the shut-off time of the pump actuator \n204 may instead, or in addition, be adjusted (e.g., shut offlater \nif the volume of the liquid delivered after the pump actuator \n204 is deactivated is lower than expected, and shut off earlier \nif the volume of the liquid delivered after the pump actuator \n204 is deactivated is higher than expected) in order to keep the \nvolume of the drug delivered relatively consistent. Once \nagain, this may be done using a linear approximation, where \nthe pump actuator 204 is deactivated as soon as the following \ncondition is met: \n\naccumulateaf/in axforeviozas \n\nshutofprevious  V. iarget \n\nwhere V \nis the total volume of the drug delivered so \nfar in the current dose, F is the real-time flow rate of the drug \nwas the maximum flow \nthrough the cannula 120, F, \nrate of the drug through the cannula 120 from the previous \nwas the volume of the drug delivered \ndose, V \n\nShutoff previous \n\n\fUS 9,283,322 B2 \n\n11 \nafter the pump actuator 204 was shut off in the previous dose, \nand V, \nis the target volume of the drug to be delivered. In \nthis manner, the adaptive controller 212 constantly adjusts the \nway in which the pump 200 is actuated, and accounts for \nsystematic, non-random changes in the pump 200 character \nistics. \n\nDetermining and controlling both the amount of current \nneeded to initiate the flow of drug through the cannula 120 \nand then to reach a particular flow rate, as well as the amount \nof liquid delivered from the drug reservoir 108 after the cur \nrent is no longer applied to the electrolysis electrodes 134, is \nof particular benefit when the pump 200 is an electrolysis \ndriven pump. In particular, the first parameter is important \nbecause the amount of current needed to initiate the flow of \ndrug through the cannula 120 and to reach a particular flow \nrate depends on how much liquid is left in the drug reservoir \n108. Using too low a current would be power-inefficient, \nsince all systems would be running even though there would \nbe no or very low flow of drug through the cannula 120. On \nthe other hand, using too high a current could cause the flow \nrate of the drug to overshoot to unsafe levels. The second \nparameter is also of importance since the Volume of drug \ndelivered after the pump 200 is turned off is dependent pri \nmarily on the gas/liquid ratio in the electrolysis chamber 112. \nFor doses later in the life-cycle of the pump 200 (e.g., where \nthe pump 200 runs with a high gas/liquid ratio in the elec \ntrolysis chamber 112), there is much more gas that needs to be \ndissipated before the pump 200 can fully stop. The opposite is \ntrue for earlier doses. \n\nAs will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, in \naddition to the two examples given above, the adaptive con \ntroller 212 may recognize and analyze  numerous other \nchanges in conditions internal to the pump 200 when control \nling the pump actuator 204 and, ultimately, the dispensing of \nthe drug from the drug reservoir 108. For example, there may \nbe situations where is it desirable for the pump 200 to reach an \noptimal flow rate (F) for each dose in a specified period \nof time (t) and to then maintain that flow rate for the \nremainder of the dose. One way to achieve this is to begin \neach dose by using a constant current (I) to drive the \nelectrolysis electrodes 134 of the pump 200 until the optimal \nflow rate (F) is reached, at which point feedback from \nthe flow sensor 144 and an algorithm (e.g., a proportional \nintegral-derivative (\u201cPID) algorithm or another algorithm) \nmay be used to adjust the current Supplied to the electrolysis \nelectrodes 134 to maintain that optimal flow rate (F) for \nthe remainder of the dose. In other words, the pump 200 may \nbe driven using a time-varying current waveform. In one \nembodiment, in  order to  achieve the  optimal flow  rate \n(F) in the specified period of time (t), the starting \ncurrent (I) is adjusted from dose to dose. In a manner \nsimilar to before, this can be done, for example, using a linear \napproximation (although, as will be understood by one of \nordinary skill in the art, non-linear approximations may also \nbe employed for any of the parameters derived herein). More \nspecifically,  the  starting  current  for  the  current  dose \n(Ise) can be calculated using the starting current \nfrom the previous dose (Ini) and the time it took \nfor the flow rate to reach the optimal flow rate (F) in the \n), as follows: \nprevious dose ( \n\nprevious \n\nstarting current  'previous/optima px. iariiragoreviozas \n\nReferring now to FIG. 4, an exemplary graph 300 illustrat \ning the effects of the above-described adaptive control on the \ndrug dosage level is depicted. In this example, the target \ndosage level to be delivered during each release event is 200 \nnanoliters (nl). Event 1 corresponds to an initial dosing of \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n12 \n180 n  based on calculations using the reference parameter \nvalues. The adaptive controller 212 then calculates appropri \nate  adjustments  to  the  pump 200 parameters  (e.g.,  as \ndescribed above, the amount of current supplied to the elec \ntrolysis electrodes 134 and/or the actuation time thereof may \nbe increased in order to increase the volume of drug delivered \nto the target site) until a target delivery of 200 mL is achieved \nat Event 2. As illustrated, there may be a point 304 in time \nbetween Event 1 and Event 2 during which the adaptive \ncontroller 212 overcompensates and the pump 200 delivers \nmore than the target dosage (e.g., 205 nL). In this case, the \nadaptive controller 212 refines its adjustments to the pump \n200 parameters (e.g., as described above, the amount of cur \nrent supplied to the electrolysis electrodes 134 and/or the \nactuation time thereof may be decreased in order to decrease \nthe volume of drug delivered to the target site) until the target \ndelivery of 200 mL is in fact achieved at Event 2. \n\nContinuing with the example depicted in the graph 300 of \nFIG. 4, the dosage at Event 3 then drops to 190 mL due to a \nchange in one or more of the pump 200 parameters. Exem \nplary conditions within the pump 200 itself that may change \nand lead to Such a decrease in the dosage of the drug delivered \n(i.e., to a decrease in the efficiency of the pump 200) can \ninclude the degradation (e.g., erosion or corrosion) of the \nelectrolysis electrodes 134, a decrease in the concentration of \nthe electrolytes in the solution present in the electrolysis \nchamber 112, and/or general mechanical or chemical wear. In \nresponse, the adaptive controller 212 then compensates as \ndescribed above so that the pump 200 releases the correct \namount of drug at Event 4. The pump 200 thus dynamically \nreacts to changing conditions of the pump 200. \n\nFIG. 5A depicts exemplary flow profiles 400 and actuation \nprofiles 404 for a pump that operates without the feedback \ncontrol provided by the control circuitry 132 (e.g., for a pump \nemploying an open-loop control system). As shown, the \namount of drug delivered at later times decreases even though \nthe actuation current remains the same (the actuation profiles \n404 for the earlier and later doses overlap in FIG. 5A), due to \ndecreasing pump efficiency. \n\nFIG. 5B depicts exemplary flow profiles 408 and actuation \nprofiles 412 for a pump 200 that operates with the feedback \ncontrol provided by the control circuitry 132. In particular, \nFIG. 5B shows how increasing the pumping time for a later \ndose can compensate for reduced pump 200 efficiency. More \nspecifically, for the later dose, the pump 200 actuates for a \nlonger period of time at the same current in order to Success \nfully deliver the target dosage amount. \n\nFIG. 5C also depicts exemplary flow profiles 416 and \nactuation profiles 420 for a pump 200 that operates with the \nfeedback control provided by the control circuitry 132. In \nparticular, FIG.5C shows how the dosing time for the earlier \nand later doses can be kept constant while still compensating \nfor decreased pump 200 efficiency by increasing the actuation \ncurrent of the later dose. The flow profiles 416 for the earlier \nand later doses overlap, illustrating that the same amount of \ndrug is delivered during both dosages. \nC. Adaptive Control Based Upon Conditions of the Target \nSite \n\nIn other embodiments, with reference again to FIGS. 1-3, \nthe adaptive controller 212 can also receive information from \nthe target site sensor(s) 148 that monitor the drug-delivery \ntreatment area, and thereafter change the target dosage for \ncertain time periods. More particularly, if changes in the \ntreatment area (e.g., worsening or improvement of symptoms, \nchanges in biological or biochemical parameters, changes in \nelectrical activity, changes in pressure, etc.) require a higher \nor lower dosing level or a change in the frequency of dosages, \n\n\fUS 9,283,322 B2 \n\n13 \nthe adaptive controller 212 can control the pump actuator 204 \nSo as to adjust the dosage and maintain it at a new level until \nanother change is required. In other words, the adaptive con \ntroller 212 may actuate the pump 200 to achieve a desired \nresult, such as the regulation of a specific physiological State \nor biochemical parameter. As before, the parameters sensed \nby the target sensor(s) 148 (e.g., pressure, temperature, etc.) \nmay be stored in the computer memory 208 for later use (e.g., \nfor comparison in determining the appropriate dosage of drug \nto be delivered). \n\nAs an example, assume that the pump 200 delivers an \ninitial target dosage of 200 mL every 30 minutes. After a \nperiod of time, either due to a change in the treatment area or \ndosing regimen, the dosage may need to be decreased to 150 \nnL. The adaptive controller 212 may then operate the pump \nactuator 204 so as to deliver 150 nL of the drug every 30 \nminutes until instructed otherwise, either by another change \nin the treatment area or by a user of the pump 200. \n\nAdvantageously, this flexibility facilitates the use of the \npump 200 with a wide range of treatment regimens that may \nrequire the staggering of different dosages or dosage frequen \ncies over prolonged periods of time. \n\nOptionally,  the  adaptive  controller  212  may be pro \ngrammed to respond to both a change in a condition of the \npump 200 itselfand, at the same time, to a change in condition \nof the target treatment area. In other words, the adaptive \ncontroller 212 may receive data from both sensors or other \ndevices internal to the pump 200 and from the target site \nsensor(s) 148, analyze both sets of data, and control the pump \nactuator 204 to account for both sets of data. Alternatively, in \nanother embodiment, if the deterministic parameters are to be \nthose of the pump 200 itself rather than those of the treatment \narea, the adaptive controller 212 may be programmed to \nrefrain from initiating actions based on, for example, block \nages that may form within the target area due to physiological \nchanges or Scarring. \nD. Exemplary Uses of the Dynamic, Adaptively Controlled \nDrug-Delivery Pumps \n\nFIG. 6 schematically illustrates a drug-delivery pump 100, \n200 implanted in the eye of a patient in accordance with one \nembodiment of the invention. As illustrated, the pump 100, \n200 is placed upon the conjunctiva of the eye, and a distal end \nof the cannula 120 is inserted therethrough in to the posterior \nchamber of the eye. As such, the distal end of the cannula 120 \n(and, hence, the drug reservoir 108) is in fluid communication \nwith the patient.  The drug-delivery pump 100, 200 then \nadministers a therapeutic liquid to the posterior chamber of \nthe eye through the cannula 120 and the check valve 140, \nwhich, as previously mentioned, may be employed to prevent \nthe backflow of the liquid. In particular, the pump actuator \n204 may be controlled through use of the adaptive controller \n212 and the other control circuitry 132 in any of the manners \ndescribed hereinabove (e.g., based on a change in a condition \nof the pump itself and/or based on conditions of the target \nsite) so as to deliver one or more dosages of the liquid from the \ndrug reservoir 108, through the cannula 120, and into the \npatient\u2019s eye. \n\nIn other embodiments, the pump 100,200 is used to admin \nister the liquid to the anterior chamber of the eye, which is \nseparated from the posterior chamber by the lens. More gen \nerally, however, the pump 100, 200 may, as previously men \ntioned, be employed to administer liquid to any portion of the \npatient\u2019s body. \n\nAs an additional example, the pump 100, 200 may be a \nbody-adhered electrolysis-driven pump for the infusion of \nmedication into a patient\u2019s Subcutaneous tissue. For example, \nthe pump 100, 200 may continuously deliver insulin to the \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n14 \npatient\u2019s body over three to seven days. A patient may need, \nhowever, to  recalculate his  or her insulin delivery (e.g., \nincrease or decrease basal rates over time), as well as program \nthe pump 100, 200 to give an intermittent bolus spike of \ninsulin after a meal. Accordingly, the pump 100, 200 in this \nexample can adapt the electrolysis to increase or decrease the \nflow of insulin to accurately deliver the correct fluidic vol \numes over time. Furthermore, infusion of a drug over an \nextended period of time, such as three days, may subject the \npump 100,  200  to  new  environmental  conditions.  For \nexample, a patient may drive from low to high altitudes or fly \nin a pressurized plane. The pump 100, 200 can use both \nenvironmental signals (e.g., altimeter, pressure change, flow \nrate change, etc.) to adjust the flow of the drug and to ensure \nthe accurate delivery of the drug. \n\nAs yet another example, the pump 100, 200 may use input \nfrom an accelerometer or gyroscope in  order to  sense a \npatient\u2019s position. For example, the pump 100,200 may sense \nthat the patient was horizontal during the hours of 10 pm to 6 \nam for the previous 7 days (because, for example, the patient \nwas sleeping). In this case, the pump 100, 200 may then \nrecognize the patients sleep time (i.e.,  from sensing the \npatient to be in a horizontal position) or REM sleep cycle and \nthen use that information to infuse a different volume of drug \n(or drug at specific times) to accommodate optimal condi \ntions. For example, the flow rate of the pump 100, 200 may be \nadjusted to an amount pre-prescribed by a physician for infu \nsion during sleep (e.g., it is often best to inject Some glaucoma \nmedications to a patient\u2019s eye during REM sleep cycle in \norder to better distribute the medication throughout the eye, \nwhile some medications such as Anti-VEGF drugs for the \nretina act over a period of a month and should be injected \ncalmly into the vitreous; in addition, a lower basal rate of \ninsulin or less pain medication may be injected during sleep). \nIn contrast to understanding when a patient is sleeping, the \npump 100, 200 may also recognize when the patient is exer \ncising or when the patient is not Supine, and adjust its infusion \nof drug accordingly (e.g., such as to that which is pre-pro \ngrammed by the physician for infusion during certain activi \nties). \n\nAdvantageously, the control circuitry 132 described herein \ncan be employed for pumps that are not uniform in their \ncharacteristics, either due to  user-selected preferences or \nvariations arising during the manufacturing process. The \ntypes  of electrodes  and electrolytic  solution  used,  for \nexample, determine the performance of electrolysis-driven \npumps. The control circuitry 132 is, however, robust and \nVersatile enough to accommodate pumps that operate across \na wide range of parameter values. As another example, manu \nfacturing process variations in the resistance of the flow sen \nSor elements can be mitigated by the adaptive nature of the \ncontrol circuitry 132. More specifically, mismatched resis \ntances in the flow sensor elements resulting from the process \nvariations will result in an offset for which the control cir \ncuitry 132 can compensate. \n\nOptionally, the control circuitry 132 may also serve to \nenhance safety and efficacy of the pump 100, 200 by moni \ntoring certain key pump parameters. For example, acceptable \nranges may be defined for each parameter or for some overall \ncombination of parameters corresponding to a specific pump \nstate, during which the pump 100, 200 continues to operate \nnormally. Should an individual parameter or some combina \ntion of parameters not fall within these pre-defined ranges, an \naction may then be triggered within the pump 100, 200, such \nas shutting off or alerting the user that a response is required. \nFor example, the pump 100, 200 may alter a patient by illu \nmination, Sound, vibration, or shock. In one embodiment, the \n\n\fUS 9,283,322 B2 \n\n15 \nalert is programmed to occur when the patient is moving to \nmaximize the likelihood that the patient will receive the alert \nand also to conserve battery power by avoiding alerts while \nthe patient is sleeping. \n\nIn one particular example, the control circuitry 132 can \nrespond to and predict the failure of a flow sensor 144. Where, \nfor example, the flow sensor 144 includes a group of heaters \nand resistive temperature detectors, one of its elements may \nbegin to fail after an indeterminate number of doses due to \nthermal stresses experienced during its use. The control cir \ncuitry 132 can monitor the resistance of the heater elements \nperiodically (e.g., from dose to dose) and detect changes in \nresistance that may indicate the start of failure or outright \nfailure (such as an open-circuit). Other pump components \nincluding sensors and actuators that employ resistive  or \ncapacitive elements can likewise be monitored by the control \ncircuitry 132 to ensure proper functional operation. \n\nHaving described certain embodiments of the invention, it \nwill be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other \nembodiments incorporating the concepts disclosed herein \nmay be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the \ninvention. For example, although the adaptive controller 212 \nand the  other control  circuitry  132 has primarily  been \ndescribed for use in connection with an electrolysis-driven \npump, this is for illustrative purposes only. Those of ordinary \nskill in the art will readily appreciate and understand that the \nadaptive controller 212 and the other control circuitry 132 \nmay also be usefully employed in other types of drug-delivery \npumps, such as those that rely on, for example, electroosmo \nsis,  mechanical actuation, or pressure-driven mechanisms. \nAccordingly, the described embodiments are to be considered \nin all respects as only illustrative and not restrictive. \n\nWhat is claimed is: \n1.

More specifically,  embodiments of the \ninvention relate to swallowable drug delivery devices for \ndelivering drugs to the Small intestine. \n\nWhile there has been an increasing development of new \ndrugs in  recent years for the treatment of a  variety  of \ndiseases, many have limited application because they cannot \nbe given orally. This is due to a number of reasons including: \npoor oral toleration  with complications including gastric \nirritation and bleeding; breakdown/degradation of the drug \ncompounds in the stomach; and poor, slow or erratic absorp \ntion of the drug. Conventional alternative drug delivery \nmethods such as  intravenous and intramuscular delivery \nhave a number of drawbacks including pain and risk of \ninfection from a needle Stick, requirements for the use of \nsterile technique and the requirement and associated risks of \nmaintaining an IV line in a patient for an extended period of \ntime.  While other  drug delivery  approaches  have been \nemployed Such as implantable drug delivery pumps, these \napproaches require the semi-permanent implantation of a \ndevice and can still  have many of the limitations of IV \ndelivery. Thus, there is a need for an improved method for \ndelivery of drugs and other therapeutic agents, including a \nneed for improved delivery of liraglutide and other thera \npeutic agents for the treatment of diabetes and other blood \nglucose regulation disorders. \n\n2 \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\nEmbodiments of the invention provide devices, systems, \nkits and methods for delivering drugs and other therapeutic \nagents to various locations in the body. Many embodiments \nprovide a swallowable device for delivering drugs and other \ntherapeutic agents within  the Gastrointestinal  (GI) tract. \nParticular embodiments provide a swallowable device such \nas a capsule for  delivering drugs and other therapeutic \nagents into the wall of the Small intestine or other GI organ \nwall. Embodiments of the invention are particularly useful \nfor the delivery of drugs and other therapeutic agents which \nare poorly absorbed, poorly tolerated and/or degraded within \nthe GI tract. Further, embodiments of the invention can be \nused to deliver drugs which were previously only capable of \nor preferably delivered by intravenous or other form of \nparenteral  administration  including  various  non-vascular \ninjected forms of administration Such as intramuscular or \nSubcutaneous injection. \n\nIn one aspect of the invention, the invention provides a \ntherapeutic agent preparation for delivery into a wall of the \nintestinal tract, the preparation comprises a therapeutically \neffective dose of at least one therapeutic agent. The prepa \nration has a shape and material consistency to be contained \nin a swallowable capsule or other swallowable device and \ndelivered from the capsule into the intestinal wall to release \nthe dose of therapeutic agent from within the intestinal wall. \nIn another embodiment, the invention provides a thera \npeutic agent preparation for delivery into a wall of the \nintestinal tract such as the wall of the small intestine, the \npreparation comprises a therapeutically effective dose of at \nleast one therapeutic agent. The preparation is configured to \nbe contained in a Swallowable capsule and operably coupled \nto an actuator, expandable balloon or other device having a \nfirst configuration and a second configuration. The prepara \ntion is contained within the capsule in the first configuration \nand advanced out of the capsule and into the intestinal wall \nin the second configuration to deliver the therapeutic agent \ninto the intestinal wall. \n\nIn other embodiments, the invention provides a method \nfor delivering a therapeutic agent into the wall of the small \nintestine  comprising Swallowing a  drug delivery  device \ncomprising a capsule, an actuator and an embodiment of the \ntherapeutic agent preparation. The actuator is responsive to \na condition in the Small intestine Such as pH so as to actuate \ndelivery of the therapeutic agent preparation into the wall of \nthe Small intestine. In specific embodiments, the actuator can \ncomprise a release element or coating on the capsule which \nis degraded by a selected pH in the small intestine. Once \ndegraded, the element or coating initiates delivery of the \ntherapeutic agent preparation by one or more delivery means \nSuch as the by expansion of one or more balloons that are \noperably coupled to tissue penetrating members that contain \nthe therapeutic  agent preparation  and are  configured to \npenetrate and be advanced into the intestinal  wall upon \nexpansion of the balloon. Once the tissue penetrating mem \nbers are in the intestinal wall, they degrade to release the \ntherapeutic agent into the bloodstream. Because the thera \npeutic agent preparation is delivered directly into the wall of \nthe small intestine,  the time period (described herein as \nC) for achieving the  maximum concentration  of the \ntherapeutic agent in the bloodstream or other location in the \nbody is shorter than a corresponding time period for achiev \ning such a maximum concentration when the therapeutic \nagent is  non-vascularly injected into the body Such as by \nintramuscular or Subcutaneous injection. In various embodi \nments, the time period for achieving C  by insertion of the \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n3 \ntherapeutic preparation into the intestinal wall using one or \nmore embodiments of the invention (such as an embodiment \nof the swallowable device) can be 80%, 50%, 30%, 20 or \neven 10% of the time period for achieving a C  through \nthe use of a non-vascular injection of the therapeutic agent. \nIn other embodiments, the C  achieved by insertion of the \ntherapeutic preparation into the intestinal wall using one or \nmore embodiments of the invention, Such as an embodiment \nof the Swallowable device,  can be greater than a C, \nachieved by taking a convention oral form of the therapeutic \nagent (e.g., a pill) where the therapeutic agent is not inserted \ninto the intestinal wall. In various embodiments, the \nachieved by insertion of the therapeutic preparation into the \nintestinal  wall  using one or  more embodiments  of the \ninvention  (such  as  an  embodiment of the  swallowable \ndevice) can be 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or even a 100 \ntimes greater than when the therapeutic agent is delivered in \na pill or other oral form. In other related embodiments, the \ncomposition  can be configured to  produce a long-term \nrelease of therapeutic agent with a selectable t/2, that is the \ntime period required for the concentration of the therapeutic \nagent in the bloodstream or other location in the body to \nreach half its original C  value after having reached C. \nFor example, the selectable t/2 may be 6, or 9, or 12, or 15 \nor 18, or 24 hours. \n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a Swallowable \ndevice for delivering a  drug or other therapeutic  agent \npreparation into the wall of the Small or large intestine or \nother organ of the gastro-intestinal tract organ. The devise \ncomprises a capsule sized to be Swallowed and pass through \nthe gastro-intestinal tract, a deployable aligner positioned \nwithin the capsule for aligning a longitudinal axis of the \ncapsule with the a longitudinal axis of the Small intestine, a \ndelivery mechanism for delivering the therapeutic agent into \nthe intestinal wall and a deployment member for deploying \nat least one of the aligner or the delivery mechanism. The \ncapsule wall is degradable by contact with liquids in the GI \ntract but also may include an outer coating or layer which \nonly degrades in the higher pH's found in the Small intestine, \nand serves to  protect the underlying capsule wall  from \ndegradation within the stomach before the capsule reaches \nthe  small  intestine at  which point the  drug delivery  is \ninitiated by degradation of the coating. In use. Such materials \nallow for the targeted delivery of a therapeutic agent in a \nselected portion of the intestinal  tract  such as the small \nintestine. Suitable outer coatings can include various enteric \ncoatings such as various co-polymers of Methacrylic Acid \nand Ethyl Acrylate. \n\nAnother embodiment of the capsule includes at least one \nguide tube, one or more tissue penetrating members posi \ntioned in the at least one guide tube, a delivery member and \nan actuating mechanism. The tissue penetrating member will \ntypically comprise a hollow needle or other like structure \nand will have a lumen and a tissue penetrating end for \npenetrating a selectable depth into the intestinal wall.  In \nvarious embodiments, the device can include a second and \na third tissue penetrating member with additional numbers \ncontemplated. Each tissue penetrating member can include \nthe same or a different  drug.  In  preferred embodiments \nhaving multiple tissue penetrating members, the tissue pen \netrating members can be symmetrically distributed around \nthe perimeter of the capsule so as to anchor the capsule onto \nthe intestinal wall during delivery of drug. In some embodi \nments, all or a portion of the tissue penetrating member (e.g., \nthe tissue penetrating end) can be fabricated from the drug \npreparation itself.  In these and related embodiments, the \ndrug preparation can have a needle or dart-like structure \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n4 \n(with or without barbs) configured to  penetrate and be \nretained in the intestinal wall. \n\nThe tissue penetrating member can be fabricated from \nvarious biodegradable materials (e.g.,  PGLA, maltose or \nother Sugar) so as to degrade within the Small intestine and \nthus provide a fail-safe mechanism for detaching the tissue \npenetrating member from the intestinal  wall should this \ncomponent become retained in the intestinal wall. Addition \nally, in theses and related embodiments, selectable portions \nof the capsule can be fabricated from such biodegradable \nmaterials so as to allow the entire device to controllably \ndegrade into Smaller pieces. Such embodiments facilitate \npassage and excretion of the devices through GI tract.  In \nparticular embodiments, the capsule can include seams of \nbiodegradable material which controllably degrade to break \nthe capsule into pieces of a selectable size and shape to \nfacilitate passage through the GI tract. The seams can be \npre-stressed, perforated or otherwise treated to accelerate \ndegradation. The concept of using biodegradable seams to \nproduce controlled degradation of a swallowable device in \nthe GI tract can also be applied to other swallowable devices \nSuch as Swallowable cameras to facilitate passage through \nthe GI tract and reduce the likelihood of a device becoming \nstuck in the GI tract. \n\nThe delivery member is configured to advance the drug \nfrom the capsule through the tissue penetrating member \nlumen and into  the intestinal  wall. Typically, at  least a \nportion of the delivery member is advanceable within the \ntissue penetrating member lumen. The delivery member can \nhave a piston or like structure sized to fit within the delivery \nmember lumen. The distal end of the delivery member (the \nend which is  advanced into tissue)  can have a plunger \nelement which advances the drug within tissue penetrating \nmember lumen and also forms a seal with the lumen. The \nplunger element can be integral or attached to the delivery \nmember. Preferably, the delivery member is configured to \ntravel a fixed distance within the needle lumen so as to \ndeliver a fixed or metered dose of drug into the intestinal \nwall. This can be achieved by one or more of the selection \nof the diameter of the delivery member (e.g., the diameter \ncan be distally tapered), the diameter of the tissue penetrat \ning member (which can be narrowed at its distal end), use of \na stop, and/or the actuating mechanism. For embodiments of \nthe device having a tissue penetrating member fabricated \nfrom drug (e.g., a drug dart), the delivery member is adapted \nto advance the dart out of the capsule and into tissue. \n\nThe delivery member and tissue penetrating member can \nbe configured for the delivery of liquid, semi-liquid or solid \nforms of drug or all three. Solid forms of drug can include \nboth powder or pellet. Semi liquid can include a slurry or \npaste. The drug can be contained within a cavity of the \ncapsule, or in the case of the liquid or semi-liquid, within an \nenclosed reservoir. In some embodiments, the capsule can \ninclude a first second, or a third drug (or more). Such drugs \ncan be contained within  the tissue  penetrating  member \nlumen (in  the case of Solids  or powder) or in  separate \nreservoirs within the capsule body. \n\nThe actuating mechanism can be coupled to at least one \nof the tissue penetrating member or the delivery member. \nThe actuating mechanism is configured to advance the tissue \npenetrating member a selectable distance into the intestinal \nwall as well as advance the delivery member to deliver the \ndrug and then withdraw the tissue penetrating member from \nthe intestinal wall. In various embodiments, the actuating \nmechanism can comprise a preloaded spring mechanism \nwhich is configured to be released by the release element. \nSuitable springs can include both coil (including conical \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n5 \nshaped springs) and leaf springs with other spring structures \nalso contemplated. In particular embodiments, the spring \ncan be cone shaped to reduce the length of the spring in the \ncompressed State even to the point where the compressed \nlength of the spring is about the thickness of several coils \n(e.g., two or three) or only one coil. \n\nIn particular embodiments the actuating mechanism com \nprises a spring, a first motion converter, and a second motion \nconverter  and a track  member. The release  element  is \ncoupled to the spring to retain the spring in a compressed \nstate Such that degradation of the release element releases \nthe  spring.  The first  motion converter is  configured to \nconvert motion of the spring to advance and withdraw the \ntissue penetrating element in and out of tissue. The second \nmotion converter is  configured to convert motion of the \nspring  to  advance the  delivery  member into  the  tissue \npenetrating  member lumen.  The motion  converters  are \npushed by the spring and ride along a rod or other track \nmember which serves to guide the path of the converters. \nThey engage the tissue penetrating member and/or delivery \nmember (directly  or  indirectly)  to  produce the  desired \nmotion. They are desirably configured to convert motion of \nthe spring along its longitudinal axis into orthogonal motion \nof the tissue penetrating member and/or delivery member \nthough conversion in other directions is also contemplated. \nThe motion converters can have a wedge, trapezoidal or \ncurved shape with other shapes also contemplated. In par \nticular embodiments, the first motion converter can have a \ntrapezoidal shape and include a slot which engages a pin on \nthe tissue penetrating member that rides in the slot. The slot \ncan have a trapezoidal  shape that  mirrors  or otherwise \ncorresponds to the overall shape of the converter and serves \nto push the tissue penetrating member during the upslope \nportion of the trapezoid and then pull it  back during the \ndown slope portion. In one variation, one or both of the \nmotion converters can comprise a cam or cam like device \nwhich is turned by the spring and engages the tissue pen \netrating and/or delivery member. \n\nIn other variations, the actuating mechanism can also \ncomprise an electro-mechanical device/mechanism Such as a \nSolenoid or a piezoelectric device. In one embodiment, the \npiezoelectric device can comprise a shaped piezoelectric \nelement which has a non-deployed and deployed State. This \nelement can be configured to go into the deployed State upon \nthe application of a Voltage and then return to the non \ndeployed state upon the removal of the voltage. This and \nrelated embodiments allow for a reciprocating motion of the \nactuating  mechanism  so as  to  both  advance  the  tissue \npenetrating member and then withdraw it. \n\nThe release element is  coupled to  at least one of the \nactuating mechanism or a spring coupled to the actuating \nmechanism. In particular embodiments, the release element \nis coupled to a spring positioned within the capsule so as to \nretain the spring in a compressed State. Degradation of the \nrelease element releases the spring to actuate the actuation \nmechanism.  In  many embodiments, the release element \ncomprises a material configured to degrade upon exposure to \nchemical conditions in the Small or large intestine Such as \npH. Typically, the release element is configured to degrade \nupon exposure to a selected pH in the Small intestine, e.g., \n7.0. 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0 or greater. However, it can also be \nconfigured to degrade in response to other conditions in the \nSmall intestine. In particular embodiments, the release ele \nment can be configured to degrade in response to particular \nchemical conditions in the fluids in the small intestine such \nas those which occur after ingestion of a meal (e.g., a meal \nhigh in fats or proteins). \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n6 \nBiodegradation of the release element from one or more \nconditions in the small intestine (or other location in the GI \ntract) can be achieved by selection of the materials for the \nrelease element, the amount of cross linking of those mate \nrials as well as the thickness and other dimensions of the \nrelease elements. Lesser amounts of cross linking and or \nthinner dimensions can increase the rate of degradation and \nvisa versa. Suitable materials for the release element can \ncomprise biodegradable materials such as various enteric \nmaterials which are configured to degrade upon exposure to \nthe higher pH or other condition in the small intestine. The \nenteric materials can be copolymerized or otherwise mixed \nwith one or more polymers to obtain a number of particular \nmaterial properties in addition to biodegradation. Such prop \nerties  can  include  without  limitation  stiffness,  strength, \nflexibility and hardness. \n\nIn particular embodiments, the release element can com \nprise a film or plug that fits over or otherwise blocks the \nguide tube and retains the tissue penetrating member inside \nthe guide tube. In these and related embodiments, the tissue \npenetrating member is coupled to a spring loaded actuating \nmechanism Such that when the release element is degraded \nSufficiently, it releases the tissue penetrating member which \nthen springs out of the guide tube to penetrate into the \nintestinal wall. In other embodiments, the release element \ncan be shaped to function as a latch which holds the tissue \npenetrating element in place. In these and related embodi \nments, the release element can be located on the exterior or \nthe interior of the capsule. In the interior embodiments, the \ncapsule and guide tubes are configured to allow for the \ningress of intestinal fluids into the capsule interior to allow \nfor the degradation of the release element. \n\nIn some embodiments, the actuating mechanism can be \nactuated by means of a  sensor,  Such as  a pH or other \nchemical sensor which detects the presence of the capsule in \nthe  Small  intestine  and sends a signal  to  the  actuating \nmechanism (or to an electronic controller coupled to the \nactuating mechanism to actuate the mechanism). Embodi \nments of a pH sensor can comprise an electrode-based \nsensor or it can be a mechanically-based sensor Such as a \npolymer which shrinks or expands upon exposure to the pH \nor other chemical conditions in the small intestine. In related \nembodiments, an expandable/contractable sensor can also \ncomprise the  actuating  mechanism  itself  by  using  the \nmechanical motion from the expansion or contraction of the \nSSO. \n\nAccording to another embodiment for detecting that the \ndevice is in the small intestine (or other location in the GI \ntract),  the sensor can comprise a strain  gauge or other \npressure/force sensor for detecting the number of peristaltic \ncontractions that the capsule is  being Subject to within a \nparticular location in the intestinal tract.  In these embodi \nments, the capsule is desirably sized to be gripped by the \nSmall intestine  during a peristaltic  contraction.  Different \nlocations  within  the  GI tract  have  different  number of \nperistaltic contractions. The small intestine has between 12 \nto 9 contractions per minute with the frequency decreasing \ndown the length of the intestine. Thus, according to one or \nmore embodiments detection of the number of peristaltic \ncontractions can be used to not only determine if the capsule \nis in the small intestine but the relative location within the \nintestine as well. \n\nAs an alternative or Supplement to internally activated \ndrug delivery, in Some embodiments, the user may exter \nnally activate the actuating mechanism to deliver drug by \nmeans of RF, magnetic or other wireless signaling means \nknown in the art. In these and related embodiments, the user \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n7 \ncan use a handheld device (e.g., a hand held RF device) \nwhich not only includes signaling means, but also means for \ninforming the user when the device is in the small intestine \nor other location in the GI tract. The later embodiment can \nbe implemented by including an  RF transmitter on the \nswallowable device to signal to the user when the device is \nin the Small intestine or other location (e.g., by signaling an \ninput from the sensor). The same handheld device can also \nbe configured to alter the user when the actuating mecha \nnism has been activated and the selected drug(s) delivered. \nIn this way, the user is provided confirmation that the drug \nhas  been  delivered.  This  allows  the  user  to  take  other \nappropriate drugs/therapeutic agents as well as make other \nrelated decisions (e.g., for diabetics to eat a meal or not and \nwhat foods should be eaten). The handheld device can also \nbe configured to send a signal to the Swallowable device to \nover-ride the actuating mechanism and so prevent, delay or \naccelerate the delivery of drug. In use. Such embodiments \nallow the user to intervene to prevent, delay or accelerate the \ndelivery of drug based upon other symptoms and/or patient \nactions (e.g., eating a meal, deciding to go to sleep, exercise \netc). \n\nThe  user  may also  externally  activate  the  actuating \nmechanism at a selected time period after Swallowing the \ncapsule. The time period can be correlated to a typical transit \ntime or range of transit times for food moving through the \nuser's GI tract to a particular location in the tract such as the \nSmall intestine. \n\nAnother aspect of the inventions provides therapeutic \nagent preparations for delivery into the wall of the small \nintestine (or other wall in the intestinal tract) using embodi \nments of the  Swallowable device  described herein.  The \npreparation comprises a therapeutically effective dose of at \nleast one therapeutic agent. It may comprise a solid, liquid \nor combination of both and can include one or more phar \nmaceutical excipients.  The preparation has a shape and \nmaterial consistency to be contained in embodiments of the \nswallowable capsule, delivered from the capsule into the \nintestinal wall and degrade within the wall to release the \ndose of therapeutic agent. The preparation may also have a \nselectable Surface area to  Volume ratio So as enhance or \notherwise control the rate of degradation of the preparation \nin the wall of the small intestine or other body lumen. In \nvarious embodiments, the preparation can be configured to \nbe coupled to an actuator Such as a release element or \nactuation  mechanism which has a first  configuration  in \nwhich the preparation is  contained in the capsule and a \nsecond configuration in which the preparation is advanced \nout of the capsule and into the wall of the small intestine. \nThe dose of the drug or other therapeutic agent in  the \npreparation can be titrated downward from that which would \nbe required for conventional oral delivery methods so that \npotential side effects from the drug can be reduced. \n\nTypically, though not necessarily, the preparation will be \nshaped and otherwise configured to be contained in  the \nlumen of a tissue penetrating member, such as a hollow \nneedle which is configured to be advanced out of the capsule \nand into the wall of the small intestine. The preparation itself \nmay comprise a tissue penetrating member configured to be \nadvanced into the wall of the small intestine or other lumen \nin the intestinal tract. \n\nAnother aspect of the invention provides methods for the \ndelivery of drugs and the therapeutic agents into the walls of \nthe GI tract using embodiments of the swallowable drug \ndelivery devices. Such methods can be used for the delivery \nof therapeutically effective amounts of a variety of drugs and \nother therapeutic agents. These include a number of large \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n8 \nmolecule peptides  and proteins  which would otherwise \nrequire injection due to chemical breakdown in the stomach \ne.g., growth hormone, parathyroid hormone, insulin, inter \nferons and other like compounds. Suitable drugs and other \ntherapeutic agents which can be delivered by embodiments \nof invention include various chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., \ninterferon), antibiotics, antivirals, insulin and related com \npounds, glucagon like peptides (e.g., GLP-1, exenatide), \nparathyroid hormones, growth hormones (e.g.,  IFG and \nother growth factors), anti-seizure agents, immune Suppres \nsion agents and anti-parasitic agents such as various anti \nmalarial agents. The dosage of the particular drug can be \ntitrated  for the patients weight, age,  condition  or other \nparameter. \n\nIn  various  method embodiments, embodiments of the \ndrug swallowable drug delivery  device can be used to \ndeliver a plurality of drugs for the treatment of multiple \nconditions or for the treatment of a particular condition (e.g., \na mixture of protease inhibitors for treatment HIV AIDS). In \nuse, such embodiments allow a patient to forgo the necessity \nof having to take multiple  medications  for a particular \ncondition or conditions. Also, they provide a means for \nfacilitating that a regimen of two or more drugs is delivered \nand absorbed into the small intestine and thus, the blood \nstream at about the same time. Due to differences in chemi \ncal makeup, molecular weight, etc, drugs can be absorbed \nthrough the intestinal  wall at different rates,  resulting in \ndifferent pharmacokinetic distribution curves. Embodiments \nof the invention address this issue by injecting the desired \ndrug mixtures at about the same time. This in turn improves \npharmacokinetics  and thus,  the efficacy  of the  selected \nmixture of drugs. \n\nFurther  details  of these  and  other  embodiments and \naspects of the invention are described more fully below, with \nreference to the attached drawing figures. \n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n\nFIG. 1a is a lateral viewing showing an embodiment of a \n\n40 \n\nswallowable drug delivery device. \n\nFIG. 1b is a lateral viewing showing an embodiment of a \n\nsystem including a Swallowable drug delivery device. \n\nFIG. 1c is a lateral viewing showing an embodiment of a \nkit including a swallowable drug delivery device and a set of \ninstructions for use. \n\nFIG. 1d is a lateral viewing showing an embodiment of a \nSwallowable drug delivery device including a drug reservoir. \nFIG. 2 is a lateral view illustrating an embodiment of the \nSwallowable drug delivery device having a spring loaded \nactuation mechanism for advancing tissue penetrating mem \nbers into tissue. \n\nFIG. 3 is a lateral view illustrating an embodiment of the \nSwallowable drug delivery device having a spring loaded \nactuation mechanism having a first motion converter. \n\nFIG. 4 is a lateral view illustrating an embodiment of the \nSwallowable drug delivery device having a spring loaded \nactuation  mechanism having  first  and a second motion \nconverter. \n\nFIG. 5 is a perspective view illustrating engagement of the \nfirst and second motion converters with the tissue penetrat \ning member and delivery members. \n\nFIG. 6 is a cross sectional view illustrating an embodi \nment of the Swallowable drug delivery  device having a \nsingle tissue penetrating member and an actuating mecha \nnism for advancing the tissue penetrating member. \n\nFIG. 7a is a cross sectional view illustrating an embodi \nment of the swallowable drug delivery device having mul \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\ntiple tissue penetrating members and an actuating mecha \nnism for advancing the tissue penetrating members. \n\nFIG. 7b is a cross sectional view illustrating deployment \nof the tissue penetrating members of the embodiment of \nFIG. 7a to deliver medication to a delivery site and anchor \nthe device in the intestinal wall during delivery. \n\nFIGS. 8a\u20138c are side views illustrating positioning of the \ndrug delivery device in the Small intestine and deployment \nof the tissue penetrating members to deliver drug;

As used herein, the term \u201cmedication\u201d \nrefers to a medicinal preparation in any form which can \ninclude drugs or other therapeutic agents as well as one or \nmore pharmaceutical excipients. Many embodiments pro \nvide a swallowable device for delivering medication within \nthe GI tract. Particular embodiments provide a swallowable \ndevice Such as a capsule for delivering medications to the \nwall of the small intestine or other GI organ. As used herein, \n\u201cGI tract\u201d refers to the esophagus, stomach, Small intestine, \nlarge intestine and anus, while \u201cIntestinal tract\u201d refers to the \nSmall and large intestine. Various embodiments of the inven \ntion can be configured and arranged for delivery of medi \ncation into the intestinal tract as well as the entire GI tract. \nReferring now to FIGS. 1-11, an embodiment of a device \n10 for the delivery of medication 100 to a delivery site DS \nin the intestinal tract such as the wall of the small intestine, \ncomprises a capsule 20 including at least one guide tube 30, \none or more tissue penetrating members 40 positioned or \notherwise advanceable in  the at  least one guide tube, a \ndelivery member 50, an actuating mechanism 60 and release \nelement 70. Medication 100, also described herein as prepa \nration 100, typically comprises at least one drug or other \ntherapeutic agent 101 and may include one or more phar \nmaceutical excipients known in the art. Collectively, one or \nmore of delivery member 50 and mechanism 60 may com \nprise a means for delivery of medication 100 into a wall of \nthe  intestinal  tract.  Other delivery  means contemplated \nherein include one or more expandable balloons (e.g., deliv \nery  balloon  172)  or  other  expandable  device/member \ndescribed herein. \n\nDevice 10 can be configured for the delivery of liquid, \nsemi-liquid or solid forms of medication 100 or all three. \nSolid forms of medication/preparation 100 can include both \npowder or pellet. Semi liquid forms can include a slurry or \npaste. Whatever the form, preparation 100 desirably has a \nshape and material consistency allowing the medication to \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n11 \nbe advanced out of the device, into the intestinal wall (or \nother luminal wall in the GI tract) and then degrade in the \nintestinal wall to release the drug or other therapeutic agent \n101. The material consistency can include one or more of the \nhardness, porosity and Solubility of the preparation (in body \nfluids). The material consistency can be achieved by one or \nmore of the following: i) the compaction force used to make \nthe preparation; ii) the use of one or more pharmaceutical \ndisintegrants known in the art; iii) use of other pharmaceu \ntical excipients; iv) the particle size and distribution of the \npreparation  (e.g.,  micronized  particles);  and  V)  use  of \nmicronizing and other particle formation methods known in \nthe art.  Suitable shapes for preparation  100 can include \ncylindrical, cubical, rectangular, conical, spherical, hemi \nspherical and combinations thereof. Also, the shape can be \nselected so as to define a particular Surface area and Volume \nof preparation 100 and thus, the ratio between the two. The \nratio  of Surface area to  Volume can in  turn, be used to \nachieve a selected rate of degradation within the intestinal or \nother lumen wall within the GI tract.  Larger ratios (e.g., \nlarger amounts of Surface area per unit volume) can be used \nto achieve faster rates of degradation and vice versa.  In \nparticular embodiments, the Surface area to Volume ratio can \nbe in the range of about 1:1 to 100:1, with specific embodi \nments of 2:1, 5:1, 20:1, 25:1, 50:1 and 75:1. Preparation/ \nmedication 100 will typically be pre-packed within a lumen \n44 of tissue  penetrating  members 40,  but can also  be \ncontained at another location within an interior 24 of capsule \n20, or in the case of a liquid  or semi-liquid, within an \nenclosed reservoir 27. The medication can be pre-shaped to \nfit into the lumen or packed for example, in a powder form. \nTypically, the device 10 will be configured to deliver a single \ndrug 101 as part of medication 100.  However in  some \nembodiments, the device 10 can be configured for delivery \nof multiple drugs 101 including a first second, or a third drug \nwhich can be compounded into a single or multiple medi \ncations 100. For embodiments having multiple medications/ \ndrugs, the medications can be contained in separate tissue \npenetrating members 40 or within separate compartments or \nreservoirs 27 within capsule 20. In another embodiment, a \nfirst dose 102 of medication 100 containing a first drug 101 \ncan be packed into the penetrating member(s) 40 and a \nsecond dose 103 of medication 100 (containing the same or \na different drug 101) can be coated onto the surface 25 of \ncapsule as is shown in the embodiment of FIG. 1b. The \ndrugs 101 in the two doses of medication 102 and 103 can \nbe the same or different. In this way, a bimodal pharma \ncokinetic  release of the same or different drugs can be \nachieved. The second dose 103 of medication 100 can have \nan enteric coating 104 to ensure that it is  released in the \nSmall intestine and achieve a time release of the medication \n100 as well. Enteric coating 104 can include one or more \nenteric coatings described herein or known in the art. \n\nA system 11 for delivery of medication 100 into the wall \nof the small intestine or other location within the GI tract, \nmay comprise device 10, containing one or more medica \ntions  100  for  the  treatment  of a  selected  condition  or \nconditions. In some embodiments, the system may include a \nhand held device 13, described herein for communicating \nwith device 10 as is shown in the embodiment of FIG. 1b. \nSystem 11  may also be configured as a kit 14 including \nsystem 11 and a set of instructions for use 15 which are \npackaged in packaging 12 as is shown in the embodiment of \nFIG. 1c. The instructions can indicate to the patient when to \ntake the device 10 relative to one or more events such as the \ningestion of a meal or a physiological measurement such as \nblood glucose, cholesterol, etc. In Such embodiments, kit 14 \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n12 \ncan include multiple devices 10 containing a regimen of \nmedications 100 for a selected period of administration, e.g., \na day, week, or multiple weeks depending upon the condi \ntion to be treated. \n\nCapsule 20 is sized to be swallowed and pass through the \nintestinal tract.  The size can also be adjusted depending \nupon the amount of drug to be delivered as well as the \npatients weight and adult vs. pediatric applications. Capsule \n20 includes an interior volume 24 and an outer surface 25 \nhaving one or more apertures 26 sized for guide tubes 30. In \naddition to the other components of device 10, (e.g., the \nactuation mechanism etc.) the interior Volume can include \none or more compartments or reservoirs 27. One or more \nportions  of capsule  20 can  be fabricated  from  various \nbiocompatible polymers known in the art, including various \nbiodegradable polymers which in a preferred embodiment \ncan  comprise  PGLA (polylactic-co-glycolic  acid).  Other \nsuitable  biodegradable  materials  include  various  enteric \nmaterials described herein  as well as lactide,  glycolide, \nlactic  acid,  glycolic  acid,  para-dioxanone,  caprolactone, \ntrimethylene carbonate, caprolactone, blends and copoly \nmers thereof. As is  described in  further detail herein, in \nvarious embodiments, capsule 20 can include seams 22 of \nbio-degradable material So as to controllably degrade into \nSmaller pieces 23 which are more easily passed through the \nintestinal tract. Additionally, in various embodiments, the \ncapsule can  include  various  radio-opaque  or echogenic \nmaterials for location of the device using fluoroscopy, ultra \nSound  or  other  medical  imaging  modality.  In  specific \nembodiments, all or a portion of the capsule can include \nradio-opaque/echogenic markers 20m as is  shown in the \nembodiment of FIGS. 1a and 1b. In use, such materials not \nonly allow for the location of device 10 in the GI tract, but \nalso allow for the determination of transit times of the device \nthrough the GI tract. \n\nIn preferred embodiments, tissue penetrating members 40 \nare positioned within guide tubes 30 which serve to guide \nand Support the advancement of members 40 into tissue Such \nas the wall of the small intestine or other portion of the GI \ntract.  The tissue  penetrating  members 40 will  typically \ncomprise a hollow needle or other like structure and will \nhave a lumen 44 and a tissue  penetrating  end 45 for \npenetrating a selectable depth into the intestinal wall IW. \nMember 40 may also include a pin 41 for engagement with \na  motion  converter 90 described  herein.  The depth  of \npenetration can be controlled by the length of member 40, \nthe configuration of motion converter 90 described herein as \nwell as the placement of a stop or flange 40s on member 40 \nwhich  can,  in  an  embodiment,  correspond  to  pin  41 \ndescribed herein. Medication 100 will typically be delivered \ninto tissue through lumen 44. In many embodiments, lumen \n44 is pre-packed with the desired medication 100 which is \nadvanced out of the lumen using delivery member 50 or \nother advancement means (e.g. by means of force applied to \na collapsible embodiment of member 40). As an alternative, \nmedication 100 can be advanced into lumen 44 from another \nlocation/compartment in capsule 20. In some embodiments, \nall or a portion of the tissue penetrating member 40 can be \nfabricated from medication 100 itself.  In these and related \nembodiments, the medication can have a needle or dart-like \nstructure (with or without barbs) configured to penetrate and \nbe retained in the intestinal wall, such as the wall of the \nSmall intestine. The dart can be sized and shaped depending \nupon the medication, dose and desired depth of penetration \ninto the intestinal wall. Medication 100 can be formed into \ndarts,  pellets  or other shapes using various compression \nmolding methods known in the pharmaceutical arts. \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n13 \nIn various embodiments, device 10 can include a second \n42 and a third 43 tissue penetrating member 40 as is shown \nin the embodiments of FIGS. 7a and 7b, with additional \nnumbers contemplated. Each tissue penetrating member 40 \ncan be used to deliver the same or a different medication \n100. In preferred embodiments, the tissue penetrating mem \nbers  40  can  be  substantially  symmetrically  distributed \naround the perimeter 21 of capsule 20 so as to anchor the \ncapsule onto  the  intestinal  wall  IW during  delivery  of \nmedications  100.  Anchoring capsule 20 in  such a  way \nreduces the likelihood that the capsule will be displaced or \nmoved by peristaltic contractions occurring during delivery \nof the medication. In specific embodiments, the amount of \nanchoring force can be adjusted to the typical forces applied \nduring peristaltic contraction of the Small intestine. Anchor \ning can be further facilitated by configured some or all of \ntissue penetrating members 40 to have a curved or arcuate \nshape. \n\nDelivery member 50 is configured to advance medication \n100 through the tissue penetrating member lumen 44 and \ninto the intestinal wall IW. Accordingly, at least a portion of \nthe delivery member 50 is advanceable within the tissue \npenetrating member lumen 44 and thus member 50 has a size \nand shape (e.g., a piston like shape) configured to fit within \nthe delivery member lumen 44. \n\nIn some embodiments, the distal end 50d of the delivery \nmember (the end which is advanced into tissue) can have a \nplunger element 51 which advances the medication within \nthe tissue penetrating member lumen 44 and also forms a \nseal with the lumen. Plunger element 51 can be integral or \nattached to delivery member 50. Preferably, delivery mem \nber 50 is  configured to travel a fixed distance within the \nneedle lumen 44 so as to deliver a fixed or metered dose of \ndrug into the intestinal wall IW. This can be achieved by one \nor more of the selection of the diameter of the delivery \nmember (e.g.,  the diameter can be distally  tapered), the \ndiameter of the tissue penetrating member (which can be \nnarrowed at its distal end), use of a stop, and/or the actuating \nmechanism. However in some embodiments, the stroke or \ntravel distance of member 50 can be adjusted in situ respon \nsive to various factors such as one or more sensed conditions \nin the GI tract. In situ adjustment can be achieved through \nuse of logic resource 29 (including controller 29c) coupled \nto an electro-mechanical embodiment of actuating mecha \nnism 60.  This allows for a variable dose of medication \nand/or variation of the distance the medication is injected \ninto the intestinal wall. \n\nActuating mechanism 60 can be coupled to at least one of \nthe tissue penetrating member 40 or delivery member 50. \nThe actuating mechanism is configured to advance tissue \npenetrating member 40 a selectable distance into the intes \ntinal wall IW as well as advance the delivery member to \ndeliver medication 100 and then withdraw the tissue pen \netrating member from the intestinal wall. In various embodi \nments,  actuating  mechanism  60  can  comprise a spring \nloaded mechanism which is configured to be released by \nrelease element 70. Suitable springs 80 can include both coil \n(including conical shaped springs) and leaf springs with \nother  spring  structures  also  contemplated.  In  particular \nembodiments, spring 80 can be substantially cone-shaped to \nreduce the length of the spring in the compressed State even \nto the point where the compressed length of the spring is \nabout the thickness of several coils (e.g., two or three) or \nonly one coil. \n\nIn particular embodiments actuating mechanism 60 can \ncomprise a spring 80, a first motion converter 90, and a \nsecond motion converter 94 and a track member 98 as is \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n14 \nshown in the embodiments of FIGS. 2, 4 and 8a-8c. The \nrelease element 70 is coupled to  spring 80 to  retain the \nspring in a compressed state Such that degradation of the \nrelease  element releases  the  spring.  Spring 80 may be \ncoupled to release element 70 by a latch or other connecting \nelement 81.  First  motion converter 90 is  configured to \nconvert motion of spring 80 to advance and withdraw the \ntissue penetrating member 40 in and out of the intestinal wall \nor other tissue. The second motion converter 94 is config \nured to convert motion of the spring 80 to advance the \ndelivery  member 50 into  the tissue penetrating  member \nlumen 44. Motion converters 90 and 94 are pushed by the \nspring and ride along a rod or other track member 98 which \nfits into a track member lumen 99 of converter 90. The track \nmember 98 serves to guide the path of the converters 90. \nConverters 90 and 94 engage the tissue penetrating member \n40 and/or delivery  member 50 (directly or indirectly) to \nproduce the desired motion. They have a shape and other \ncharacteristics configured to convert motion of the spring 80 \nalong its  longitudinal axis into orthogonal motion of the \ntissue penetrating member 40 and/or delivery member 50 \nthough conversion in other directions is also contemplated. \nThe motion converters can have a wedge, trapezoidal or \ncurved shape with other shapes also contemplated. In par \nticular embodiments, the first motion converter 90 can have \na trapezoidal shape 90t and include a slot 93 which engages \na pin 41 on the tissue penetrating member that rides in the \nslot as is shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 2, 3 and 4. Slot \n93 can also have a trapezoidal shape 93t that mirrors or \notherwise corresponds to the overall shape of converter 90. \nSlot 93 serves to push the tissue penetrating member 40 \nduring the upslope portion 91 of the trapezoid and then pull \nit back during the down slope portion 92. In one variation, \none or both of the motion converters 90 and 94 can comprise \na cam or cam like device (not shown). The cam can be \nturned by spring 80 so as to engage the tissue penetrating \nand/or delivery members 40 and 50. One or more compo \nnents of mechanism 60 (as well as other components of \ndevice 10) including motion converters 90 and 94 can be \nfabricated using various MEMS-based methods known in \nthe art so as to allow for selected amounts of miniaturization \nto fit within capsule 10. Also as is described herein, they can \nbe formed from various biodegradable materials known in \nthe art. \n\nIn other variations, the actuating mechanism 60 can also \ncomprise an electro-mechanical device/mechanism such as a \nSolenoid or a piezoelectric device. In one embodiment, a \npiezoelectric device used in mechanism 60 can comprise a \nshaped piezoelectric element which has a non-deployed and \ndeployed State. This element can be configured to go into the \ndeployed State upon the application of a Voltage and then \nreturn to the non-deployed state upon the removal of the \nVoltage or other change in the Voltage. This and related \nembodiments allow for a reciprocating motion of the actu \nating mechanism 60 so as to both advance the tissue pen \netrating member and then withdraw it. The voltage for the \npiezoelectric element can be obtained generated using a \nbattery or a piezoelectric based energy converter which \ngenerates Voltage by mechanical deformation Such as that \nwhich occurs from compression of the capsule 20 by a \nperistaltic  contraction  of the  Small intestine around the \ncapsule. Further description of piezoelectric based energy \nconverters  is  found in  U.S. patent application  Ser.  No. \n12/556,524 which is fully incorporated by reference herein \nfor all purposes. In one embodiment, deployment of tissue \npenetrating members 40 can in fact be triggered from a \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n15 \nperistaltic contraction of the small intestine which provides \nthe mechanical energy for generating Voltage for the piezo \nelectric element. \n\nRelease element 70  will  typically  be coupled to  the \nactuating mechanism 60 and/or a spring coupled to the \nactuating mechanism; however, other configurations are also \ncontemplated. In preferred embodiments, release element 70 \nis coupled to a spring 80 positioned within capsule 20 So as \nto retain the spring in a compressed State 85 as shown in the \nembodiment of FIG. 2. Degradation of the release element \n70 releases spring 80 to actuate actuation mechanism 60. \nAccordingly, release element 70 can thus function as an \nactuator 70a (actuator 70 may also include spring 80 and \nother elements of mechanism 60). As is explained further \nbelow, release element 70/actuator 70a has a first configu \nration where the therapeutic agent preparation 100 is con \ntained within capsule 20 and a second configuration where \nthe therapeutic  agent preparation  is  advanced from  the \ncapsule into the wall of the small intestine or other luminal \nwall in the intestinal tract. \n\nIn many embodiments, release element 70 comprises a \nmaterial configured to degrade upon exposure to chemical \nconditions  in  the  Small  or large  intestine  such  as  pH. \nTypically, release element 70 is configured to degrade upon \nexposure to a selected pH in the Small intestine, e.g., 7.0. 7.1, \n7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.68.0 or greater. The release element can \nalso be configured to degrade within a particular range of pH \nsuch as, e.g., 7.0 to 7.5. In particular embodiments, the pH \nat which release element 70 degrades (defined herein as the \ndegradation pH) can be selected for the particular drug to be \ndelivered so as to release the drug at a location in Small \nintestine which corresponds to the selected pH. Further, for \nembodiments of device 10 having multiple medications 100, \nthe device can include a first release element 70 (coupled to \nan actuating mechanism for delivering a first drug) config \nured to degrade at first pH and a second release element 70 \n(coupled to an actuating mechanism for delivering a second \ndrug) configured to degrade at a second pH (with additional \nnumbers of release elements contemplated for varying num \nber of drugs). \n\nRelease element 70 can also be configured to degrade in \nresponse to other conditions in the Small intestine (or other \nGI location). In particular embodiments, the release element \n70 can be configured to degrade in response to particular \nchemical conditions in the fluids in the small intestine such \nas those which occur after ingestion of a meal (e.g., a meal \ncontaining fats, starches or proteins). In this way, the release \nof medication  100 can be substantially  synchronized or \notherwise timed with the digestion of a meal. \n\nVarious approaches are contemplated for biodegradation \nof release element 70. In particular embodiments, biodeg \nradation of release element 70 from one or more conditions \nin the small intestine (or other location in the GI tract) can \nbe achieved by one or more of the following approaches: i) \nselection of the materials for the release element, ii)  the \namount of cross linking of those materials;  and iii)  the \nthickness  and other  dimensions  of the  release  element. \nLesser amounts of cross linking and or thinner dimensions \ncan increase the rate of degradation and visa Versa. Suitable \nmaterials for the release element can comprise biodegrad \nable materials such as various enteric materials which are \nconfigured to degrade upon exposure to the higher pH in the \nintestines.  Suitable enteric  materials include, but are not \nlimited to, the following: cellulose acetate phthalate, cellu \nlose  acetate  trimellitate,  hydroxypropyl  methylcellulose \nphthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, carboxymethylethyl \ncellulose, co-polymerized methacrylic acid/methacrylic acid \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n16 \nmethyl esters as well as other enteric materials known in the \nart. The selected enteric materials can be copolymerized or \notherwise combined with one or more other polymers to \nobtain a number of other particular material properties in \naddition  to  biodegradation.  Such properties  can  include \nwithout limitation stiffness, strength, flexibility and hard \nCSS. \nIn alternative embodiments, the release element 70 can \ncomprise a film or plug 70p that fits over or otherwise blocks \nguide tubes 30 and retains the tissue penetrating member 40 \ninside the guide tube.  In these and related embodiments, \ntissue penetrating member 40 is coupled to a spring loaded \nactuating mechanism Such that when the release element is \ndegraded sufficiently, it releases the tissue penetrating mem \nber which then springs out of the guide tube to penetrate into \nthe intestinal wall. In still other embodiments, release ele \nment 70 can be shaped to function as a latch which holds the \ntissue penetrating member 40 in place. In these and related \nembodiments, the release element can be located on the \nexterior or the interior of capsule 20.  In  the latter case, \ncapsule 20 and/or guide tubes 30 can be configured to allow \nfor the ingress of intestinal fluids into the capsule interior to \nallow for the degradation of the release element. \n\nIn some embodiments, actuating mechanism 60 can be \nactuated by means of a sensor 67, such as a pH sensor 68 or \nother chemical sensor which detects the presence of the \ncapsule in the small intestine. Sensor 67 can then send a \nsignal to actuating mechanism 60 or to an electronic con \ntroller 29c coupled to actuating mechanism 60 to actuate the \nmechanism. Embodiments of a pH sensor 68 can comprise \nan electrode-based sensor or it can be a mechanically-based \nsensor such as a polymer which shrinks or expands upon \nexposure to a selected pH or other chemical conditions in the \nSmall intestine.  In  related embodiments, an expandable/ \ncontractible  sensor  67 can  also  comprise the  actuating \nmechanism 60 itself by using the mechanical motion from \nthe expansion or contraction of the sensor. \n\nAccording to another embodiment for detecting that the \ndevice in the small intestine (or other location in the GI \ntract), sensor 67 can comprise pressure/force sensor Such as \nstrain gauge for detecting the number of peristaltic contrac \ntions that capsule 20 is being Subject to within a particular \nlocation in the intestinal tract (in Such embodiments capsule \n20 is desirably sized to be gripped by the small intestine \nduring a peristaltic contraction). Different locations within \nthe GI tract have different number of peristaltic contractions. \nThe small intestine has between 12 to 9 contractions per \nminute with the frequency decreasing down the length of the \nintestine.  Thus, according to one or more embodiments, \ndetection of the number of peristaltic contractions can be \nused to not only determine if capsule 20 is  in the small \nintestine, but the relative location within the intestine as \nwell. In use, these and related embodiments allow for release \nof medication  100 at a particular location  in  the  small \nintestine. \n\nAs an alternative or Supplement to internally activated \ndrug delivery (e.g., using a release element and/or sensor), \nin Some embodiments, the user may externally activate the \nactuating mechanism 60 to deliver medication 100 by means \nof RF, magnetic or other wireless signaling means known in \nthe art. In these and related embodiments, the user can use \na handheld communication device 13 (e.g., a hand held RF \ndevice Such as a cell phone) as is shown in the embodiment \nof FIG. 1b, to send a receive signals 17 from device 10. In \nSuch embodiments, Swallowable device may include a trans \nmitter 28 such as an  RF transceiver chip or other like \ncommunication device/circuitry. Handheld device 13 may \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n17 \nnot only  includes  signaling  means, but also  means for \ninforming the user when device 10 is in the small intestine \nor other location in the GI tract. The later embodiment can \nbe implemented through the use of logic resources 29 (e.g., \na processor 29) coupled to transmitter 28 to signal to detect \nand singe to the user when the device is in the Small intestine \nor other location  (e.g.,  by signaling an input  from  the \nsensor). Logic resources 29 may include a controller 29c \n(either in  hardware or software) to control one or more \naspects of the process. The same handheld device can also \nbe configured to alert the user when actuating mechanism 60 \nhas been activated and the selected medication 100 delivered \n(e.g., using processor 29 and transmitter 28). In this way, the \nuser is provided confirmation that medication 100 has been \ndelivered. This allows the user to take other appropriate \ndrugs/therapeutic  agents  as  well as  make other  related \ndecisions (e.g., for diabetics to eat a meal or not and what \nfoods should be eaten). The handheld device can also be \nconfigured to send a signal to swallowable device 10 to \nover-ride actuating mechanism 60 and so prevent delay or \naccelerate the delivery of medication  100.  In  use,  such \nembodiments allow the user to intervene to prevent, delay or \naccelerate the delivery  of medication, based upon other \nsymptoms and/or patient actions (e.g., eating a meal, decid \ning to go to sleep, exercise etc). The user may also externally \nactivate actuating mechanism 60 at a selected time period \nafter Swallowing the capsule. The time period can be cor \nrelated to a typical transit time or range of transit times for \nfood moving through the user's GI tract to  a particular \nlocation in the tract Such as the Small intestine. \n\nIn particular embodiments, the capsule 20 can include \nseams 22 of biodegradable  material  which controllably \ndegrade to break the capsule into capsule pieces 23 of a \nselectable size and shape to facilitate passage through the GI \ntract as is shown in the embodiment of FIGS. 10a and 10b. \nSeams 22 can also include pores or other openings 22p for \ningress of fluids into the seam to accelerate biodegradation \nas is shown in the embodiment of FIG. 10. Other means for \naccelerating biodegradation of seams 22 can include pre \nstressing the seam and/or including perforations 22f in the \nseam as is also shown in the embodiment of FIG. 10. In still \nother embodiments, seam 22 can be constructed of materials \nand/or have a structure which is readily degraded by absorp \ntion of ultrasound energy, e.g. high frequency ultrasound \n(HIFU), allowing the capsule to be degraded into smaller \npieces using externally or endoscopically (or other mini \nmally invasive method) administered ultrasound. \n\nSuitable materials for seams 22 can include one or more \nbiodegradable materials described herein such as PGLA, \nglycolic acid etc. Seams 22 can be attached to capsule body \n20 using various joining methods known in the polymer arts \nSuch as molding, hot melt junctions, etc. Additionally for \nembodiments of capsule 20 which are also fabricated from \nbiodegradable materials, faster biodegradation of seam 22 \ncan  be achieved by one or more of the  following:  i) \nfabricating the seam from a faster biodegrading material. ii) \npre-stressing the seam, or iii)  perforating the seam. The \nconcept of using biodegradable seams 22 to produce con \ntrolled degradation of a swallowable device in the GI tract \ncan also be applied to other swallowable devices such as \nSwallowable cameras (or other Swallowable imaging device) \nto facilitate passage through the GI tract and reduce the \nlikelihood of such a device becoming stuck in the GI tract. \nAccordingly, embodiments of biodegradable seam 22 can be \nadapted for Swallowable imaging and other Swallowable \ndevices. \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n18 \nAnother aspect of the invention provides methods for the \ndelivery of drugs and other therapeutic agents (in the form \nof medication 100) into the walls of the GI tract using one \nor more embodiments of swallowable drug delivery device \n10. An exemplary embodiment of such a method will now \nbe described. The described embodiment of drug delivery \noccurs in  the small intestine  SI.  However, it  should be \nappreciated that this is exemplary and that embodiments of \nthe invention can be used for delivering drug in a number of \nlocations in the GI tract including the stomach and the large \nintestine.  For ease  of discussion,  the Swallowable drug \ndelivery device 10 will sometimes be referred to herein as a \ncapsule.  As described  above,  in  various  embodiments, \ndevice  10  may be packaged as  a  kit  11  within  sealed \npackaging 12 that includes device 10 and a set of instruc \ntions for use 15. If the patient is using a handheld device 13, \nthe patient may instructed to enter data into device 13 either \nmanually or via a bar code 18 (or other identifying indicia \n18) located on the instructions 15 or packaging 12. If a bar \ncode is used, the patient would scan the bar code using a bar \ncode reader 19 on device 13. After opening packaging 12. \nreading the instructions 15 and entering any required data, \nthe patient swallows an embodiment of the swallowable \ndrug delivery  device 10.  Depending upon the drug, the \npatient may take the device 10 in conjunction with a meal \n(before, during or after) or a physiological measurement. \nCapsule 20 is sized to pass through the GI tract and travels \nthrough the patient\u2019s stomach S and into the Small intestine \nSI through peristaltic action as is shown in the embodiment \nof FIG. 11. Once in the small intestine, the release element \n70 is degraded by the basic pH in the small intestine (or other \nchemical or physical condition unique to the small intestine) \nSo as to actuate the actuating mechanism 60 and deliver \nmedication  100 into  the  wall  of the  small  intestine  SI \naccording to one or more embodiments of the invention. For \nembodiments including a hollow needle or other hollow \ntissue penetrating member 40, medication delivery is effec \ntuated by using the actuating mechanism 60 to advance the \nneedle 40 a selected distance into the mucosa of the intes \ntinal wall IS, and then the medication is injected through the \nneedle lumen 40 by advancement of the delivery member \n50. The delivery member 50 is withdrawn and the needle 40 \nis then withdrawn back within the body of the capsule (e.g. \nby recoil of the spring) detaching from the intestinal wall. \nFor embodiments of device 10 having multiple needles, a \nsecond or third needle 42, 43 can also be used to deliver \nadditional doses of the same drug or separate drugs 101. \nNeedle advancement can be done substantially simultane \nously or in sequence. In preferred embodiments that use \nmultiple needles, needle advancement can be done substan \ntially simultaneously so as to anchor device 10 in the small \nintestine during drug delivery. \n\nAfter medication delivery, device 10 then passes through \nthe intestinal tract including the large intestine LI and is \nultimately excreted.  For embodiments of the capsule 20 \nhaving biodegradable seams 22 or other biodegradable por \ntions, the capsule is  degraded in the intestinal tract into \nSmaller pieces to facilitate passage through and excretion \nfrom the intestinal tract as is shown in the embodiments of \nFIGS. 9a and 9b. In particular embodiments having biode \ngradable tissue penetrating needles/members 40, should the \nneedle get stuck in the intestinal wall, the needle biode \ngrades releasing the capsule 20 from the wall. \n\nFor embodiments of device 10 including a sensor 67. \nactuation of mechanism 60 can be effectuated by the sensor \nsending a signal to actuating mechanism 60 and/or a pro \ncessor 29/controller 29c coupled to the actuating mecha \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n19 \nnism. For embodiments of device 10 including external \nactuation capability, the user may externally activate actu \nating mechanism 60 at a selected time period after Swal \nlowing the capsule. The time period can be correlated to a \ntypical transit time or range of transit times for food moving \nthrough the user's GI tract to a particular location in the tract \nSuch as the Small intestine. \n\nOne or more embodiments of the above methods can be \nused for the delivery of preparations 100 containing thera \npeutically effective amounts of a variety of drugs and other \ntherapeutic agents 101 to treat a variety of diseases and \nconditions. These include a number of large molecule pep \ntides and proteins which would otherwise require injection \ndue to chemical breakdown in the stomach. The dosage of \nthe particular drug can be titrated for the patients weight, \nage or other parameter. Also the dose o drug 101 to achieve \na desired or therapeutic effect (e.g., insulin for blood glucose \nregulation) when delivered by one or more embodiments of \nthe invention can be less than the amount required should the \ndrug have been delivered by conventional oral delivery (e.g., \na swallowable pill  that  is  digested in  the stomach and \nabsorbed through the wall of the small intestine). This is due \nto the fact that there is no degradation of the drug by acid and \nother digestive fluids in the stomach and the fact that all, as \nopposed to only a portion of the drug is delivered into the \nwall of the small intestine (or other lumen in the intestinal \ntract, e.g., large intestine, stomach, etc.). Depending upon \nthe drug 101, the dose 102 delivered in preparation 100 can \nbe in the range from 100 to 5% of a dose delivered by \nconventional oral delivery (e.g., a pill) to achieve a desired \ntherapeutic effect (e.g.,  blood glucose regulation, seizure \nregulation, etc.) with even lower amounts contemplated. The \nparticular dose reduction can be titrated based upon the \nparticular drug, the condition to be treated, and the patients \nweight, age and condition.  For some drugs (with known \nlevels of degradation in the intestinal tract) a standard dose \nreduction  can  be employed (e.g.,  10 to  20%).  Larger \namounts of dose reduction can be used for drugs which are \nmore prone to degradation and poor absorption. In this way, \nthe potential toxicity and other side effects  (e.g.,  gastric \ncramping, irritable bowel, hemorrhage, etc.) of a particular \ndrug or drugs delivered by device 10 can be reduced because \nthe ingested dose is lowered. This in turn, improves patient \ncompliance because the patient has reduction both in the \nseverity and incidence of side effects. Additional benefits of \nembodiments employing dose reduction of drug 101 include \na reduced likelihood for the patient to develop a tolerance to \nthe drug (requiring higher doses) and, in the case of antibi \notics, for the patient to develop resistant strains of bacteria. \nAlso, other levels of dose reduction can be achieved for \npatients  undergoing gastric  bypass  operations  and other \nprocedures in which sections of the small intestine have \nbeen removed or its working (e.g., digestive) length effec \ntively shortened. \n\nIn addition to delivery of a single drug, embodiments of \nswallowable drug delivery device 10 and methods of their \nuse can be used to  deliver a plurality  of drugs for the \ntreatment of multiple conditions or for the treatment of a \nparticular condition (e.g., protease inhibitors for treatment \nHIV AIDS). In use, such embodiments allow a patient to \nforgo the necessity of having to take multiple medications \nfor a particular condition or conditions. Also, they provide a \nmeans for facilitating that a regimen of two or more drugs \nis delivered and absorbed into the small intestine and thus, \nthe blood stream, at about the same time. Due to difference \nin chemical makeup, molecular weight, etc., drugs can be \nabsorbed through the intestinal wall at different rates, result \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n20 \ning  in  different  pharmacokinetic  distribution  curves. \nEmbodiments of the invention address this issue by injecting \nthe desired drug mixtures at Substantially the same time. \nThis in turn, improves the pharmacokinetics and thus the \nefficacy  of the  selected  mixture of drugs.  Additionally, \neliminating the need to take multiple drugs is particularly \nbeneficial  to patients  who have one or more long term \nchronic conditions including those who have impaired cog \nnitive or physical abilities. \n\nIn various applications, embodiments of the above meth \nods can be used to deliver preparations 100 including drugs \nand therapeutic agents 101 to provide treatment for a num \nber of medical conditions and diseases. The medical condi \ntions and diseases which can be treated with embodiments of \nthe invention can include without limitation: cancer, hor \nmonal conditions (e.g., hypothyperthyroid, growth hormone \nconditions), osteoporosis, high blood pressure, elevated cho \nlesterol and triglyceride, diabetes and other glucose regula \ntion disorders, infection (local or septicemia), epilepsy and \nother seizure disorders, osteoporosis, coronary arrhythmia\u2019s \n(both atrial and ventricular), coronary ischemia anemia or \nother like condition. Still other conditions and diseases are \nalso contemplated. \n\nIn many embodiments, the treatment of the particular \ndisease or condition can be performed without the need for \ninjecting  the  drug  or  other  therapeutic  agent  (or  other \nnon-oral form of delivery such as Suppositories) but instead, \nrelying solely on the therapeutic agent(s) that is delivered \ninto the wall of the small intestine or other portion of the GI \ntract. Similarly, the patient need not take conventional oral \nforms of a drug or other therapeutic agent, but again rely \nsolely on delivery into the wall of the small intestine using \nembodiments of the swallowable capsule. In other embodi \nments, the therapeutic agent(s) delivered into the wall of the \nSmall intestine  can be delivered in  conjunction with an \ninjected dose of the agent(s). For example, the patient may \ntake a daily dose of therapeutic agent using the embodiments \nof the Swallowable capsule, but only need take an injected \ndose every several days or when the patient\u2019s condition \nrequires  it  (e.g.,  hyperglycemia).  The same is  true  for \ntherapeutic agents that are traditionally  delivered in  oral \nform (e.g., the patient can take the Swallowable capsule and \ntake the conventional oral form of the agent as needed). The \ndosages delivered in Such embodiments (e.g., the Swallowed \nand injected dose) can be titrated as needed (e.g.,  using \nstandard dose response curve and other pharmacokinetic \nmethods can be used to determine the appropriate dosages). \nAlso, for embodiments using therapeutic agents that can be \ndelivered by conventional oral means, the dose delivered \nusing embodiments of the  Swallowable capsule can be \ntitrated below the dosage normally given for oral delivery of \nthe agent since there is little or no degradation of the agent \nwithin the stomach or other portion of the intestinal tract \n(herein again standard dose response curve and other phar \nmacokinetic methods can be applied). \n\nVarious groups of embodiments of preparation 100 con \ntaining one or more drugs or other therapeutic agents 101 for \nthe treatment of various diseases and conditions will now be \ndescribed with references to dosages. It should be appreci \nated that these embodiments, including the particular thera \npeutic agents and the respective dosages are exemplary and \nthe preparation 100 can comprise a number of other thera \npeutic agents described herein (as well as those known in the \nart) that are configured for delivery into a luminal wall in the \nintestinal tract (e.g., the Small intestinal wall) using various \nembodiments of device 10. The dosages can be larger or \nSmaller than those described and can be adjusted using one \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n21 \nor more methods described herein or known in the art. In one \ngroup of embodiments, therapeutic agent preparation 100 \ncan comprise a therapeutically effective dose of insulin for \nthe treatment of diabetes and other glucose regulation dis \norders. The insulin can be human or synthetically derived as \nis known in the art. In one embodiment, preparation 100 can \ncontain a therapeutically effective amount of insulin in the \nrange of about 1-10 units (one unit being the biological \nequivalent of about 45.5ug of pure crystalline insulin), with \nparticular ranges of 2-4, 3-9, 4-9, 5-8 or 6-7. The amount of \ninsulin in the preparation can be titrated based upon one or \nmore of the following  factors  (herein,  \u201cglucose control \ntitration factors): i) the patient's condition (e.g., type 1  vs. \ntype II  diabetes; ii)  the patients previous overall level of \nglycemic control; iii) the patients weight; iv) the patients \nage; v) the frequency of dosage (e.g., once Vs. multiple times \na day); vi) time of day (e.g.,  morning VS.  evening); vii) \nparticular meal (breakfast VS. dinner); vii) content/glycemic \nindex of a particular meal (e.g., high fat/lipid and Sugar \ncontent (e.g., foods causing a rapid rise in blood Sugar) vs. \nlow fat and Sugar content; and viii) content of the patients \noverall diet (e.g., amount of Sugars and other carbohydrates, \nlipids and protein consumed daily). \n\nIn  another  group  of embodiments,  therapeutic  agent \npreparation  100 can comprise a therapeutically effective \ndose of one or more incretins for the treatment of diabetes \nand other glucose regulation disorders. Such incretins can \ninclude Glucacon like peptides 1  (GLP-1) and their ana \nlogues, and Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). Suitable GLP-1 \nanalogues  include  exenatide,  liraglutide,  albiglutide  and \ntaspoglutide as well as their analogues, derivatives and other \nfunctional equivalents. In one embodiment preparation 100 \ncan contain a therapeutically effective amount of exenatide \nin the range of about 1-10 ug, with particular ranges of 2-4, \n4-6, 4-8 and 8-10 ug respectively. In another embodiment, \npreparation  100 can  contain  a  therapeutically  effective \namount of liraglutide in the range of about 1-2 mg (milli \ngrams), with particular ranges of 1.0 to 1.4, 1.2 to 1.6 and 1.2 \nto 1.8 mg respectively. One or more of the glucose control \ntitration factors can be applied to titrate the dose ranges for \nexenatide, liraglutide or other GLP-1 analogue or incretin. \nIn yet another group of embodiments, therapeutic agent \npreparation 100 can comprise a combination of therapeutic \nagents  for the  treatment  of diabetes  and other glucose \nregulation disorders. Embodiments of Such a combination \ncan include therapeutically effective doses of incretin and \nbiguanide compounds. The incretin can comprise one or \nmore GLP-1 analogues described herein, such as exenatide \nand the biguanide can comprise metformin (e.g., that avail \nable under the Trademark of GLUCOPHAGE(R) manufac \ntured by Merck Sante\u0301 S.A.S.) and its analogue, derivatives \nand other functional equivalents. In one embodiment, prepa \nration 100 can comprise a combination of a therapeutically \neffective amount of exenatide in the range of about 1-10 ug \nand a therapeutically effective amount of metformin in a \nrange of about 1 to 3 grams. Smaller and larger ranges are \nalso contemplated with one or more of the glucose control \ntitration  factors  used  to  titrate  the  respective  dose  of \nexenatide (or other incretin) and metformin or other bigu \nanide. Additionally, the dosages of the exenatide or other \nincretin and metforminor other biguanide can be matched to \nimproved level  of glucose control  for the patient (e.g., \nmaintenance of blood glucose within normal physiological \nlevels and/or a reduction in the incidence and severity of \ninstances  of  hyperglycemia  and/or  hypoglycemia)  for \nextended periods of time ranges from hours (e.g.,  12) to a \nday to multiple days, with still longer periods contemplated. \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n22 \nMatching of dosages can also be achieved by use of the \nglucose control regulation factors as well as monitoring of \nthe  patient\u2019s  blood glucose  for  extended periods  using \nglycosylated  hemoglobin  (known  as  hemoglobin  Alc, \nHbA1c, A1C, or Hb1c) and other analytes and measure \nments correlative to long term average blood glucose levels. \nDrug delivery compositions and components of known \ndrug delivery systems may be employed and/or modified for \nuse  in  some embodiments  of the  inventions  described \nherein. For example, micro-needles and other microstruc \ntures used for delivery of drugs through the skin surface with \ndrug patches  may be modified and included within the \ncapsules described herein and used to instead deliver a drug \npreparation into a lumen wall of the gastrointestinal tract \nsuch as the wall of the small intestine. Suitable polymer \nmicro-needle  structures  may be commercially  available \nfrom Corium of California, such as the MicroCorTM micro \ndelivery  system  technology.  Other  components  of the \nMicroCorTM patch delivery systems, including drug formu \nlations or components, may also be incorporated into the \ncapsules described herein. Alternatively, a variety of pro \nviders are commercially available to  formulate combina \ntions  of polymers or other  drug-delivery  matrices  with \nselected drugs and other drug preparation components so as \nto produce desired shapes (such as the releasable tissue \npenetrating shapes described herein) having desirable drug \nrelease characteristics.  Such providers may, for example, \ninclude Corium, SurModics of Minnesota, BioSensors Inter \nnational of Singapore, or the like. \n\nOne advantage and feature of various embodiments of the \ntherapeutic compositions described herein is that the bio \nlogic (therapeutic peptide or protein) drug payload is pro \ntected from degradation and hydrolysis by the action of \npeptidases and proteases in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. \nThese enzymes are ubiquitous throughout living systems. \nThe GI tract is especially rich in proteases whose function is \nto break down the complex proteins and peptides in one\u2019s \ndiet into Smaller segments and release amino acids which are \nthen  absorbed  from  the  intestine.  The  compositions \ndescribed herein are designed to protect the therapeutic \npeptide or protein from the actions of these GI proteases and \nto deliver the peptide or protein payload directly into the \nwall of the intestine.  There are  two features  in  various \nembodiments of the compositions described herein which \nserve to protect the protein or peptide payload from the \nactions of GI proteases. First, in certain embodiments, the \ncapsule shell, which contains the deployment engine and \nmachinery, does not dissolve until it reaches the duodenal \nand Sub-duodenal intestinal  segments, owing to  the pH \nsensitive coating on the outer Surface of the capsule which \nprevents  its  dissolution  in  the low pH of the  stomach. \nSecond, in certain embodiments, hollow maltose (or other \nappropriate polymer) micro-spears contain the actual thera \npeutic peptide or protein; the maltose (or other polymer) \nmicro-spears are designed to penetrate the intestine muscle \nas soon as the outer capsule shell dissolves; and the micro \nspears themselves slowly dissolve in the intestinal muscle \nwall to release the drug payload. Thus, the peptide or protein \npayload is not exposed to the actions of the GI proteases and \ntherefore does not undergo degradation via proteolysis in the \nGI tract. This feature, in  turn, contributes to the high '% \nbioavailability of the therapeutic peptide or protein. \n\nEmbodiments described herein include therapeutic com \npositions comprising liraglutide for the treatment of diabetes \nor other glucose regulation disorders.  Such compositions \nresult in the delivery of liraglutide with desirable pharma \ncokinetic properties. In this regard, pharmacokinetic metrics \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n23 \nof note include C, the peak plasma concentration of a \ndrug after administration, t, the time to reach C; and \nt, the time required for the plasma concentration of the \ndrug to reach half its C  value after having reached C. \nThese metrics can be measured using standard pharmacoki \nnetic  measurement techniques known in  the art.  In  one \napproach plasma samples may be taken at set time intervals \n(e.g.,  one minute,  five  minutes,  /2  hour,  1  hour,  etc.) \nbeginning and then after administration of the drug or other \ntherapeutic agent either by use of a swallowable device or by \nnon-vascular injection. The concentration of the drug in \nplasma can then be measured using one or more appropriate \nanalytical methods such as GC-Mass Spec, LC-Mass Spec, \nHPLC or various ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent \nassays) which can be adapted for the particular drug. A \nconcentration vs. time curve (also herein referred to as a \nconcentration  profile)  can then  be developed using  the \nmeasurements from the plasma samples. The peak of the \nconcentration curve corresponds to C  and the time at \nwhich this occurs corresponds to t. The time in the curve \nwhere the concentration reaches half its  maximum value \n(i.e., C.) after having reached C. corresponds to ta this \nvalue is also known as the elimination half-life of the drug. \nThe start time for determination of C  can be based on the \ntime at which the injection is made for the case on non \nvascular injection and the point in time at which embodi \nments of the Swallowable device advances one or more \ntissue penetrating members (containing the drug) into the \nSmall intestine or other location in the GI tract (e.g., the large \nintestine). In the later case, this time can determined using \none or means including a remote controlled embodiment of \nthe swallowable device which deploys the tissue penetrating \nmembers into the intestine wall in response to an external \ncontrol signal (e.g., an RF signal) or for an embodiment of \nthe Swallowable device which sends an RF or other signal \ndetectable outside the body when the tissue penetrating \nmembers have been deployed. Other means for detection of \ntissue penetrating member deployment into the Small intes \ntine are contemplated Such as one more medical imaging \nmodalities including for example, ultrasound or fluoroscopy. \nIn any one of these studies, appropriate animal models can \nbe used for example, dog, pig, rat etc. in order to model the \nhuman pharmacokinetic response. \n\nThus, various embodiments provide a therapeutic com \nposition (also referred to herein as a preparation) comprising \nliraglutide. The composition is adapted for insertion into an \nintestinal wall after oral ingestion, wherein upon insertion, \nthe composition releases liraglutide into the bloodstream \nfrom the intestinal wall to achieve a C  faster than an \nextravascularly injected dose of the therapeutic agent that is \nto say, achieving a C  for the inserted form of therapeutic \nagent in a shorter time period (e.g., a smallert) than that \nfor a dose of liraglutide that is injected extravascularly Note, \nthat the dose of therapeutic agent in the composition deliv \nered into  the  intestinal  wall and the  dose delivered by \nextravascular injection, may, but need not, be comparable to \nachieve these results. In various embodiments, the compo \nsition is configured to achieve at \nfor liraglutide (e.g., by \nrelease of the liraglutide into  the bloodstream from the \nintestinal wall, e.g.,  that of the Small intestine) which is \nabout 80%, or 50%, or 30%, or 20%, or 10% of at  for an \nextravascularly  injected dose of the liraglutide.  Such an \nextravascularly  injected  dose of liraglutide  can  be,  for \nexample, a Subcutaneous injection oran intramuscular injec \ntion. In certain embodiments, the Cattained by delivering \nthe liraglutide by insertion into the intestinal wall is  sub \nstantially greater, such as 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n24 \neven a 100 times greater, than the C  attained when the \nliraglutide  is  delivered  orally  without insertion  into  the \nintestinal wall for example by a pill other convention oral \nform of the therapeutic agent or related compound. In some \nembodiments, the  therapeutic  liraglutide  composition  is \nconfigured to produce a long-term release of liraglutide. \nAlso, the  composition  can  be configured to  produce a \nlong-term release of liraglutide with a selectable t. For \nexample, the selectable t  may be 6, or 9, or 12, or 15 or \n18, or 24 hours. \n\nIn some embodiments, the therapeutic agent composition \nmay also  include a therapeutically  effective  dose of an \nincretin for the treatment of diabetes or a glucose regulation \ndisorder. Incretins which can be used include a glucagon \nlike  peptide-1  (GLP-1), a GLP-1 analogue or a gastric \ninhibitory  peptide  (GIP).  Exemplary  GLP-1  analogues \ninclude exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide and taspoglutide. \nAny appropriate  dose of an  incretin  may be used;  for \nexample, exenatide may be used in a dose ranging from \nabout 1  to 10 micrograms; or liraglutide may be used in a \nrange from about 1 to 2 mg. \n\nVarious embodiments also provide a liraglutide compo \nsition adapted for insertion into an intestinal wall after oral \ningestion, wherein upon insertion, the composition releases \nthe liraglutde into the blood stream from the intestinal wall \nto achieve a t \nthat is  greater than a to for an orally \ningested dose of the liraglutide that is not inserted into the \nintestinal wall. For example, the t  of the dose inserted into \nthe intestinal wall may be 100 or 50 or 10 or 5 times greater \nthan the dose that is not inserted into the intestinal wall. \n\nThe liraglutide may be in solid form, such as a solid form \ncomposition configured to degrade in the intestinal wall, and \nthe Solid form composition may have, for example, a tissue \npenetrating feature Such as a pointed tip. The therapeutic \ncomposition may comprise at least one biodegradable mate \nrial and/or may comprise at least one pharmaceutical excipi \nent, including a biodegradable polymer Such as PGLA or a \nSugar Such as maltose. \n\nThe therapeutic liraglutide composition may be adapted to \nbe orally  delivered in  a Swallowable capsule.  In certain \nembodiments such a Swallowable capsule may be adapted to \nbe operably coupled to a mechanism having a first configu \nration and a second configuration, the liraglutide composi \ntion being contained within the capsule in the first configu \nration and advanced out of the capsule and into the intestinal \nwall in the second configuration. Such an operably coupled \nmechanism may comprise at least one of an expandable \nmember, an expandable balloon, a valve, a tissue penetrating \nmember, a valve coupled to an expandable balloon, or a \ntissue penetrating member coupled to an expandable bal \nloon. \n\nIn some embodiments, the liraglutide composition may be \nconfigured  to  be delivered  within  a  lumen of a  tissue \npenetrating member and/or the liraglutide composition may \nbe shaped as a tissue penetrating member advanceable into \nthe intestinal wall. The tissue penetrating member may be \nsized to be completely contained within the intestinal wall, \nand/or it may include a tissue penetrating feature for pen \netrating the intestinal wall, and/or it may include a retaining \nfeature for retaining the tissue penetrating member within \nthe intestinal wall. The retaining feature may comprise, for \nexample, a barb. In some embodiments, the tissue penetrat \ning member is configured to be advanced into the intestinal \nwall by the application of a force to a surface of the tissue \npenetrating member and, optionally, the tissue penetrating \nmember has sufficient stiffness to be advanced completely \ninto the intestinal wall and/or the surface of the penetrating \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n25 \nmember is  configured to  be operatively  coupled to  an \nexpandable balloon which applies the force upon expansion \nand/or the tissue penetrating member is configured to detach \nfrom a structure applying the force when a direction of the \nforce changes. \n\nVarious  aspects  of the  invention  also  provide  other \nembodiments of a  Swallowable delivery  device for  the \ndelivery of medication 100 in addition to those described \nabove. According to one or more such embodiments, the \nSwallow delivery device can include one or more expand \nable balloons or other expandable devices for use in deliv \nering one or more tissue penetrating members including \nmedication 100 into the wall of an intestine, such as the \nsmall  intestine.  Referring  now to  FIGS.  12-20,  another \nembodiment of a device 110 for the delivery of medication \n100 to a delivery site DS in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, \ncan comprise a capsule 120 sized to be Swallowed and pass \nthrough the intestinal tract, a deployment member 130, one \nor more tissue penetrating members 140 containing medi \ncation 100, a deployable aligner 160 and a delivery mecha \nnism 170.  In  some embodiments,  medication  100 (also \nreferred to herein as preparation 100) may itself comprise \ntissue penetrating member 140. The deployable aligner 160 \nis positioned within the capsule and configured to align the \ncapsule with the intestine Such as the Small intestine. Typi \ncally,  this  will entail aligning a longitudinal axis of the \ncapsule with a longitudinal axis of the intestine; however, \nother  alignments  are  also  contemplated.  The  delivery \nmechanism 170 is configured for delivering medication 100 \ninto the intestinal wall and will typically include a delivery \nmember 172 such as an expandable member. The deploy \nment member 130 is configured for deploying at least one of \nthe aligner 160 or the delivery mechanism 170. As will be \ndescribed further herein, all or a portion of the capsule wall \nis degradable by contact with liquids in the GI tract so as to \nallow those liquids to trigger the delivery of medication 100 \nby device 110. As used herein, \u201cGI tract\u201d  refers  to  the \nesophagus, stomach,  Small  intestine,  large intestine  and \nanus, while \u201cIntestinal tract\u201d refers to the small and large \nintestine.  Various embodiments of the  invention  can  be \nconfigured and arranged for delivery of medication 100 into \nboth the intestinal tract as well as the entire GI tract. \n\nDevice 110 including tissue penetrating member 140 can \nbe configured for the delivery of liquid, semi-liquid or solid \nforms  of medication  100  or combinations  of all  three. \nWhatever the form, medication 100 desirably has a material \nconsistency allowing the medication to be advanced out of \ndevice 110, into the intestinal wall (small or large intestine) \nor other luminal wall in the GI tract and then degrade within \nthe intestinal wall to release the drug or other therapeutic \nagent 101. The material consistency of medication 100 can \ninclude one or more of the hardness, porosity and solubility \nof the preparation (in body fluids). The material consistency \ncan be achieved by selection and use of one or more of the \nfollowing: i) the compaction force used to make the prepa \nration; ii)  the use of one or more pharmaceutical disinte \ngrants known in the art;  iii)  use of other pharmaceutical \nexcipients;  iv)  the particle  size  and distribution  of the \npreparation  (e.g.,  micronized  particles);  and  V)  use  of \nmicronizing and other particle formation methods known in \nthe art. \n\nCapsule 120 is sized to be swallowed and pass through the \nintestinal tract.  The size can also be adjusted depending \nupon the amount of drug to be delivered as well as the \npatients weight and adult vs. pediatric applications. Typi \ncally, the capsule will have a tubular shape with curved ends \nsimilar to a vitamin.  In these and related embodiments, \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n26 \ncapsule lengths 120L can be in the range of 0.5 to 2 inches \nand diameters 120D in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 inches with \nother dimensions contemplated. The capsule 120 includes a \ncapsule wall 121 w, having an exterior surface 125 and an \ninterior Surface 124 defining an interior space or volume \n124v. In some embodiments, the capsule wall 121 w can \ninclude one or more apertures 126 sized for the outward \nadvancement of tissue penetrating members 140. In addition \nto the other components of device 110, (e.g., the expandable \nmember etc.) the interior Volume can include one or more \ncompartments or reservoirs 127. \n\nThe capsule can be fabricated from various biodegradable \ngelatin materials known in the pharmaceutical arts, but can \nalso include various enteric coatings 120c, configured to \nprotect the cap from degradation in the stomach (due to acids \netc.), and then Subsequently degrade in the in higher pH S \nfound in the small intestine or other area of the intestinal \ntract.  In  various  embodiments, the capsule  120 can be \nformed from multiple portions one or more of which may be \nbiodegradable. In many embodiments, capsule 120 can be \nformed from two portions  120p such as a body portion \n120p\" (herein body 120p\") and a cap portion 120p' (herein \ncap 120p), where the cap fits onto the body, e.g., by sliding \nover or under the  body (with  other arrangements  also \ncontemplated).  One portion  Such as the  cap  120p' can \ninclude a first coating 120c'configured to degrade above a \nfirst pH (e.g., pH 5.5) and the second portion such as the \nbody 120p\" can include a second coating 120c\" configured \nto degrade above a second higher pH (e.g. 6.5).  Both the \ninterior 124 and exterior 125 surfaces of capsule 120 are \ncoated with coatings 120c and 120c\" so that that either \nportion of the capsule will be substantially preserved until it \ncontacts fluid having the selected pH. For the case of body \n120p\" this allows the structural integrity of the body 120p\" \nto be maintained so as to keep balloon 172 inside the body \nportion and not deployed until balloon 130 has expanded. \nCoatings 120c' and 120c\" can include various methacrylate \nand ethyl acrylate based coatings Such as those manufac \ntured  by  Evonik  Industries  under  the  trade  name \nEUDRAGIT. These and other dual coating configurations of \nthe capsule 120 allows for mechanisms in one portion of \ncapsule 120 to be actuated before those in the other portion \nof the capsule. This is due to the fact that intestinal fluids \nwill first enter those portions where the lower pH coating has \ndegraded thus actuating triggers which are responsive to \nSuch fluids  (e.g.,  degradable  valves).  In  use.  Such  dual \ncoating embodiments for capsule 120 provide for targeted \ndrug delivery to a particular location in the Small intestine \n(or other location in  the GI tract),  as well as improved \nreliability in the delivery process. This is due to the fact that \ndeployment of a particular component, Such as aligner 160, \ncan be configured to begin in the upper area of the Small \nintestine (e.g., the duodenum) allowing the capsule to be \naligned within the intestine for optimal delivery of the drug \n(e.g., into the intestinal wall) as well as providing Sufficient \ntime  for  deployment/actuation  of other  components  to \nachieve drug delivery  into  the intestinal  wall  while the \ncapsule is  still  in  the  small  intestine  or other selected \nlocation. \n\nAs is discussed above, one or more portions of capsule \n120 can be fabricated from various biocompatible polymers \nknown in the art, including various biodegradable polymers \nwhich in a preferred embodiment can comprise cellulose, \ngelatin materials PGLA (polylactic-co-glycolic acid). Other \nsuitable  biodegradable  materials  include  various  enteric \nmaterials described herein  as well as lactide,  glycolide, \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n27 \nlactic  acid,  glycolic  acid,  para-dioxanone,  caprolactone, \ntrimethylene carbonate, caprolactone, blends and copoly \nmers thereof. \n\nIn various embodiments, the wall 120w of the capsule is \ndegradable by contact  with  liquids  in  the  GI tract  for \nexample liquids in the small intestine. In preferred embodi \nments, the capsule wall is configured to remain intact during \npassage through the stomach, but then to be degraded in the \nSmall intestine. In one or more embodiments, this can be \nachieved by the use of an outer coating or layer 120c on the \ncapsule wall 120w, which only degrades in the higher pHs \nfound in the small intestine and serves to protect the under \nlying capsule wall from degradation within the stomach \nbefore the capsule reaches the small intestine (at which point \nthe drug delivery process is initiated by degradation of the \ncoating as is described herein). In use, such coatings allow \nfor the targeted delivery of a therapeutic agent in a selected \nportion of the intestinal tract such as the Small intestine. \n\nSimilar to capsule 20, in various embodiments, capsule \n120 can include various radio-opaque, echogenic or other \nmaterials for location of the device using one or more \nmedical imaging modalities such as fluoroscopy, ultrasound, \nMRI, etc. \n\nAs is discussed further herein, in many embodiments, one \nor more of the deployment member 130, delivery member \n172 or  deployable  aligner  160,  may correspond  to  an \nexpandable balloon that is shaped and sized to fit  within \ncapsule 120. Accordingly, for ease of discussion, deploy \nment member 130, delivery member 172 and deployable \naligner 160 will now be referred to as balloon 130, 160 and \n172; however, it  should be appreciated that other devices \nincluding various expandable devices are also contemplated \nfor these elements and may include for example, various \nshape memory devices (e.g., an expandable basket made \nfrom shape memory biodegradable polymer spires), expand \nable piezo electric devices, and/or chemically expandable \ndevices having an expanded shape and size corresponding to \nthe interior volume 124v of the capsule 120. \n\nOne or more of balloons 130, 160 and 172 can comprise \nvarious polymers known in  the  medical  device arts.  In \npreferred embodiments such polymers can comprise one or \nmore types of polyethylene (PE) which may correspond to \nlow density PE(LDPE), linear low density PE (LLDPE), \nmedium density PE (MDPE) and high density PE (HDPE) \nand other forms of polyethylene known in the art.  In one \nmore embodiments using polyethylene, the material may be \ncross-linked using polymer irradiation methods known in \nthe art so. In particular embodiments radiation-based cross \nlinking may be used as to control the inflated diameter and \nshape of the balloon by decreasing the compliance of the \nballoon material. The amount or radiation may be selected to \nachieve a particular amount of cross linking to  in  turn \nproduce a particular amount of compliance for a given \nballoon, e.g., increased irradiation can be used to produce \nstiffer less compliant balloon material. Other suitable poly \nmers can include PET (polyethylene teraphalate), silicone \nand polyurethane.  In  various embodiments balloons 130, \n160 and 172 may also include various radio-opaque mate \nrials known in the art such as barium sulfate to allow the \nphysician to ascertain the position and physical state of the \nballoon (e.g.,  un-inflated, inflated or punctures. Balloons \n130, 160 and 172 can be fabricated using various balloon \nblowing methods known in the balloon catheters arts (e.g., \nmold blowing, free blowing, etc.) to have a shape and size \nwhich corresponds approximately to the interior Volume \n124v of capsule 120. In various embodiments one or more \nof balloons 130, 160 and 172 and various connecting fea \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n28 \ntures (e.g., connecting tubes) can have a unitary construction \nbeing formed from a single mold. Embodiments employing \nsuch unitary construction provide the benefit of improved \nmanufacturability and reliability since fewer joints must be \nmade between one or more components of device 110. \n\nSuitable shapes for balloons 130, 160 and 172 include \nvarious cylindrical shapes having tapered or curved end \nportions (an example of Such a shape including a hot dog). \nIn some embodiments, the inflated size (e.g., diameter) of \none or more of balloons 130, 160 and 172, can be larger than \ncapsule 120 so as to cause the capsule to come apart from the \nforce of inflation, (e.g., due to hoop stress). In other related \nembodiments, the inflated size of one or more of balloons \n130, 160 and 172 can be such that when inflated:  i) the \ncapsule 120 has sufficient contact with the walls of the small \nintestine so as to  elicit  a peristaltic  contraction  causing \ncontraction of the Small intestine around the capsule, and/or \nii) the folds of the small intestine are effaced to allow. Both \nof these results  allow for improved contact between the \ncapsule/balloon surface and the intestinal wall so as deliver \ntissue penetrating members 40 over a selected area of the \ncapsule and/or delivery balloon 172. Desirably, the walls of \nballoons 130, 160 and 172 will be thin and can have a wall \nthickness in the range of 0.005 to 0.0001\" more preferably, \nin the range of 0.005 to 0.0001, with specific embodiments \nof 0.004, 0.003, 0.002, 0.001, and 0.0005). Additionally in \nvarious embodiments, one or more of balloon 130, 160 or \n172 can have a nested balloon configuration having an \ninflation chamber 160IC and extended finger 160EF as is \nshown in the embodiments of FIG. 13c. The connecting \ntubing 163, connecting the inflation chamber 160IC can be \nnarrow to only allow the passage of gas 168, while the \nconnecting tubing 36 coupling the two halves of balloon 130 \ncan be larger to allow the passage of water. \n\nAs indicated above, the aligner 160 will typically com \nprise an expandable balloon and for ease of discussion, will \nnow be referred to as aligner balloon 160 or balloon 160. \nBalloon 160 can be fabricated using materials and methods \ndescribed above. It has an unexpanded and expanded State \n(also referred to as a deployed State).  In its expanded or \ndeployed state, balloon 160 extends the length of capsule \n120 such that forces exerted by the peristaltic contractions of \nthe small intestine SI on capsule 120 serve to align the \nlongitudinal axis 120LA of the capsule 120 in a parallel \nfashion with the longitudinal axis LAI of the small intestine \nSI. This in turn serves to align the shafts of tissue penetrating \nmembers 140 in a perpendicular fashion with the surface of \nthe intestinal wall IW to enhance and optimize the penetra \ntion of tissue penetrating members 140 into the intestinal \nwall IW. In addition to serving to align capsule 120 in the \nSmall  intestine,  aligner  160  is  also  configured to  push \ndelivery mechanism 170 out of capsule 120 prior to inflation \nof delivery balloon 172 so that the delivery balloon and/or \nmechanism is not encumbered by the capsule. In use, this \npush out function of aligner 160 improves the reliability for \ndelivery of the therapeutic agent since it is not necessary to \nwait for particular portions of the capsule (e.g., those over \nlying the delivery mechanism) to be degraded before drug \ndelivery can occur. \n\nBalloon 160 may be fluidically coupled to one or more \ncomponents of device 110 including balloons 130 and 172 \nby means of polymer tube or other fluidic couplings 162 \nwhich may include a tube 163 for coupling balloons 160 and \n130 and a tube 164 for coupling balloon 160 and balloon \n172. Tube 163 is  configured to allow balloon 160 to be \nexpanded/inflated by pressure from balloon 130 (e.g., pres \nSure generated the  mixture of chemical reactants  within \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n29 \nballoon 130) and/or otherwise allow the passage of liquid \nbetween balloons 130 and 160 to initiate a gas generating \nchemical reaction for inflation of one or both of balloons 130 \nand 160. Tube 164 connects balloon 160 to 172 so as to \nallow for the inflation of balloon 172 by balloon 160. In \nmany embodiments, tube 164 includes or is  coupled to a \ncontrol valve 155 which is configured to open at a selected \npressure so as to control the inflation of balloon 172 by \nballoon  160.  Tube  164 may thus  comprise a proximal \nportion 164p connecting to the valve and a distal portion \n164d leading from the valve. Typically, proximal and distal \nportions 164p and 164d will be connected to a valve housing \n158 as is described below. \n\nValve 155 may comprise a triangular or other shaped \nsection 156 of a material 157 which is placed within a the \nchamber 158c of a valve housing 158 (alternately, it may be \nplaced directly within tubing 164). Section 157 is configured \nto  mechanically degrade (e.g., tears, shears, delaminates, \netc.) at a selected pressure so as to allow the passage of gas \nthrough  tube  164 and/or valve chamber 158c.  Suitable \nmaterials 157 for valve 155 can include bees wax or other \nform of wax and various adhesives known in the medical \narts which have a selectable sealing force/burst pressure. \nValve fitting 158 will typically comprise a thin cylindrical \ncompartment (made from biodegradable materials) in which \nsection 156 of material 157 is placed (as is shown in the \nembodiment of FIG. 13.b) so as to seal the walls of chamber \n158c together or otherwise obstruct passage of fluid through \nthe chamber. The release pressure of valve 155 can be \ncontrolled through selection of one or more of the size and \nshape of section 156 as well as the selection of material 157 \n(e.g., for properties such as adhesive strength, shear strength \netc.).  In use,  control  valve  155 allows for a sequenced \ninflation of balloon 160 and 172 Such that balloon 160 is \nfully or otherwise substantially inflated before balloon 172 \nis inflated. This, in turn, allows balloon 160 to push balloon \n172 along with the rest of delivery mechanism 170 out of \ncapsule 120 (typically  from body portion  120p) before \nballoon 172 inflates so that deployment of tissue penetrating \nmembers 140 is not obstructed by capsule 120. In use, such \nan approach improves the reliability of the penetration of \ntissue penetrating members 140 into intestinal wall IW both \nin  terms  of achieving  a desired  penetration  depth  and \ndelivering greater numbers of the penetrating members 140 \ncontained in  capsule 120 since the advancement of the \nmembers into intestinal wall IW is not obstructed by capsule \nwall 1204: \n\nAs is  describe above, the inflated length 1601 of the \naligner balloon 160 is  sufficient to have the capsule 120 \nbecome aligned with the lateral axis of the small intestine \nfrom  peristaltic  contractions  of the  intestine.  Suitable \ninflated lengths 1601 for aligner 160 can include a range \nbetween about/2 to two times the length 1201 of the capsule \n120 before inflation  of aligner 160. Suitable  shapes for \naligner balloon 160 can include various elongated shapes \nSuch as  a hotdog like  shape.  In  specific  embodiments, \nballoon 160 can include a first section 160' and a second \nsection 160\", where expansion of first section 160' is con \nfigured to advance delivery mechanism 170 out of capsule \n120 (typically out of and second section 160\" is used to \ninflate delivery balloon 172. In these and related embodi \nments,  first  and second sections  160' and 160\" can  be \nconfigured to have a telescope-style inflation  where first \nsection 160' inflates first to push mechanism 170 out of the \ncapsule (typically  from body portion  120p') and second \nsection 160\" inflates to inflate delivery member 172. This \ncan be achieve by configuring first  section 160' to have \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n30 \nsmaller diameter and volume than second section 160\" such \nthat first section 160' inflates first (because of its smaller \nvolume) and with second section 160\" not inflating until first \nsection 60' has substantially inflated. In one embodiment, \nthis can be facilitated by use of a control valve 155 (de \nscribed above) connecting sections 160' and 160\" which \ndoes not allow passage of gas into section 160\" until a \nminimum pressure has been reached in section 160'. In some \nembodiments, the aligner balloon can contain the chemical \nreactants  which react upon mixture with water or other \nliquid from the deploying balloon. \n\nIn many embodiments, the deployment member 130 will \ncomprise an expandable balloon, known as the deployment \nballoon 130. In various embodiments, deployment balloon \n30 is  configured  to  facilitate  deployment/expansion  of \naligner balloon 160 by use of a gas, for example, generation \nof a gas 169 from a chemical. The gas may be generated by \nthe reaction of solid chemical reactants 165, such as an acid \n166 (e.g.,  citric  acid)  and a base  166 (e.g.,  potassium \nbicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate and the like) which are \nthen mixed with water or other aqueous liquid 168. The \namount of reactants  can be chosen using Stoichiometric \nmethods to produce a selected pressure in one or more of \nballoons 130, 160 and 72. The reactants 165 and liquids can \nbe stored separately in balloon 130 and 160 and then brought \ntogether in  response to a trigger event, such as the pH \nconditions  in  the small intestine.  The reactants  165 and \nliquids  168 can be stored in either balloon, however in \npreferred embodiments, liquid 168 is stored in balloon 130 \nand reactants 165 in balloon 160. To allow for passage of the \nliquid 168 to start the reaction and/or the resulting gas 169, \nballoon 130 may be coupled to aligner balloon 160 by means \nof a connector tube 163 which also typically includes a \nseparation  means  150  such as  a  degradable  valve  150 \ndescribed below. For embodiments where balloon 130 con \ntains the liquid, tube 163 has sufficient diameter to allow for \nthe passage of sufficient water from balloon 130 to balloon \n60 to produce the desired amount of gas to inflate balloon \n160 as well inflate balloon 172. Also when balloon 130 \ncontains the liquid, one or both of balloon 30 and tube 63 are \nconfigured to allow for the passage of liquid to balloon 160 \nby one or more of the following: i) the compressive forced \napplied to balloon 130 by peristaltic  contractions of the \nsmall intestine on the exposed balloon 130; and ii) wicking \nof liquid through tube 163 by capillary action. \n\nTube 163 will typically include a degradable separation \nvalve or other separation means 150 which separates the \ncontents of balloon 130, (e.g., water 158) from those of \nballoon 160 (e.g., reactants 165) until the valve degrades. \nValve 150 can be fabricated from a material such as maltose, \nwhich is degradable by liquid water so that the valve opens \nupon exposure to water along with the various liquids in the \ndigestive tract. It may also be made from materials that are \ndegradable  responsive to  the higher pH's found in  the \nintestinal fluids such as methacrylate based coatings. The \nvalve is desirably positioned at location on tube 163 which \nprotrudes above balloon 130 and/or is otherwise sufficient \nexposed such that when cap 120p' degrades the valve 150 is \nexposed to the intestinal liquids which enter the capsule. In \nvarious embodiments, valve 150 can be positioned to lie on \nthe surface of balloon 130 or even protrude above it (as is \nshown in the embodiments of FIGS. 16a and 16b), so that is \nhas  clear  exposure  to  intestinal  fluids  once  cap  120p' \ndegrades. Various embodiments of the invention provide a \nnumber of structures  for  a  separation  valve  150,  for \nexample, a beam like structure (where the valve comprises \na beam that presses down on tube 163 and/or connecting \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n31 \nsection  136),  or collar  type structure  (where the  valve \ncomprise a collar lying over tube 163 and/or connecting \nsection 136). Still other valve structures are also contem \nplated. \n\nBalloon 130 has a deployed and a non-deployed state. In \nthe deployed state, the deployment balloon 130 can have a \ndome shape 130d which corresponds to the shape of an end \nof the capsule. Other shapes 130s for the deployed balloon \n130 are also contemplated. Such as spherical, tube-shape, \netc. The reactants 165 will typically include at least two \nreactants 166 and 167, for example, an acid such as citric \nacid and a base such as sodium bicarbonate. Other reactants \n165 including other acids, e.g., ascetic acid and bases, e.g., \nsodium hydroxide are also contemplated. When the valve or \nother separation means 150 opens, the reactants mix in the \nliquid and produce a gas Such as carbon dioxide which \nexpands the aligner balloon 160 or other expandable mem \nber. \n\nIn an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 13b, the \ndeployment balloon 130 can actually comprise a first and \nsecond balloon 130' and 130\" connected by a tube 36 or \nother connection means 136 (e.g.,  a connecting section). \nConnecting tube  136 will  typically  include a separation \nvalve 150 that is degradable by a liquid as described above \nand/or a liquid having a particular pH such as basic pH \nfound in  the small intestine  (e.g.,  5.5 or 6.5).  The two \nballoons 130' and 130\" can each have a half dome shape \n130hs allowing them to fit into the end portion of the capsule \nwhen in the expanded State. One balloon can contain the \nchemical reactant(s) 165 (e.g., Sodium bicarbonate, citric \nacid, etc.) the other the liquid water 168, so that when the \nvalve is degraded the two components mix to form a gas \nwhich inflates one or both balloons 130' and 130\" and in \nturn, the aligner balloon 160. \n\nIn yet another alternative embodiment, balloon 130 can \ncomprise  a  multi-compartment  balloon  130mc,  that  is \nformed or other constructed to have multiple compartments \n130c. Typically, compartments 130c will include at least a \nfirst  and a second compartment 134 and 135 which are \nseparated by a separation  valve 150 or other separation \nmeans 150 as is shown in the embodiment of FIG. 14a. In \nmany embodiments, compartments 134 and 135 will have at \nleast a small connecting section 136 between them which is \nwhere separation valve 150 will typically be placed. A liquid \n168, typically water, can be disposed within first compart \nment 134 and one or more reactants 165 disposed in second \ncompartment 135 (which typically are solid though liquid \nmay also be used) as is shown in the embodiment of FIG. \n14a. When valve 150 opens (e.g., from degradation caused \nby fluids within the small intestine) liquid 168 enters com \npartment 135 (or vice versa or both), the reactant(s) 165 mix \nwith the liquid and produce a gas 169 such as carbon dioxide \nwhich expands balloon 130 which in turn can be used to \nexpand one or more of balloons 160 and 172. \n\nReactants 165 will typically include at least a first and a \nsecond reactant, 166 and 167 for example, an acid such as \ncitric  acid  and a base  such  as  Sodium bi-carbonate  or \npotassium bi-carbonate. As discussed herein,  in  various \nembodiments they may be placed in one or more of balloon \n130 (including compartments 134 and 135 or halves 130' \nand 130\") and balloon 160. Additional reactants, including \nother combinations of acids and bases which produce an \ninert gas by product are also contemplated. For embodi \nments using citric acid and sodium or potassium bicarbon \nate, the ratio\u2019s between the two reactants (e.g., citric acid to \npotassium bicarbonate) can be in the range of about 1:1 to \nabout 1:4, with a specific ratio of about 1:3. Desirably, solid \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n32 \nreactants 165 have little or no absorbed water. Accordingly, \none or more of the reactants, such as Sodium bicarbonate or \npotassium bicarbonate can be pre-dried (e.g., by vacuum \ndrying)  before being placed  within  balloon  130.  Other \nreactants 165 including other acids, e.g., ascetic acid and \nbases are also  contemplated. The amounts of particular \nreactants 165, including combinations of reactants can be \nselected to produce particular pressures using known Stoi \nchiometric equations for the particular chemical reactions as \nwell as the inflated volume of the balloon and the ideal gas \nlaw (e.g., PV=nRT). In particular embodiments, the amounts \nof reactants can be selected to produce a pressure selected \none or more of balloons 130, 160 and 172 to: i) achieve a \nparticular penetration depth into  the intestinal  wall; and \nproduce a particular diameter for one or more of balloons \n130, 160 and 172; and iii) exert a selected amount of force \nagainst intestinal wall IW. In particular embodiments, the \namount and ratios  of the reactants  (e.g.,  citric  acid and \npotassium bicarbonate) can be selected to achieve pressures \nin one more of the balloons 130, 160 and 172 in the range \nof 10 to 15 psi, with smaller and larger pressures contem \nplated. Again the amounts and ratio\u2019s of the reactants to \nachieve these pressures can be determined using known \nStoichiometric equations. \n\nIn various embodiments of the invention using chemical \nreactants 165 to generate gas 169, the chemical reactants \nalone or in combination with the deployment balloon 130 \ncan comprise a deployment engine for 180 deploying one or \nboth of the aligner balloon 160 and delivery mechanism 170 \nincluding delivery balloon  172.  Deployment engine 180 \nmay also include embodiments using two deployment bal \nloons 130 and 130\" (a dual dome configuration as shown in \nFIG. 13b), or a multi compartment balloon 130mc as shown \nin FIG. 14a. Other forms of a deployment engine 180 are \nalso contemplated by various embodiments of the invention \nSuch as  use of expandable piezo-electric  materials  (that \nexpand by application of a Voltage), springs and other shape \nmemory materials and various thermally expandable mate \nrials. \n\nOne or more of the expandable balloons 130, 160 and 172 \nwill also typically include a deflation valve 159 which serves \nto deflate the balloon after inflation. Deflation valve 159 can \ncomprise biodegradable materials which are configured to \ndegrade upon exposure to the fluids in the Small intestine \nand/or liquid in one of the compartments of the balloon so \nas to create an opening or channel for escape of gas within \na particular balloon.  Desirably, deflation  valves  159 are \nconfigured to degrade at a slower rate than valve 150 to \nallow sufficient time for inflation of balloons, 130, 160 and \n172 before the deflation valve degrades. In various embodi \nments, of a compartmentalized balloon 130, deflation valve \n159 can correspond to a degradable section 139 positioned \non an end portion 131 of the balloon as is shown in the \nembodiment of FIG. 14a. In this and related embodiments, \nwhen degradable section 139 degrades from exposure to the \nliquid,  balloon  wall 132 tears or otherwise comes apart \nproviding for a high assurance of rapid deflation. Multiple \ndegradable sections 139 can be placed at various locations \nwithin balloon wall 132. \n\nIn various embodiments of balloon 172, deflation valve \n159 can correspond to a tube valve 173 attached to the end \n172e of the delivery balloon 172 (opposite to the end which \nis  coupled to  the  aligner balloon)  as  is  shown in  the \nembodiment of FIG. 13b. The tube valve 173 comprises a \nhollow tube 173t having a lumen that is  obstructed at a \nselected location 1731 with a material 173m such as maltose \nthat degrades upon exposure to fluid Such as the fluid in the \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n33 \nsmall intestine. The location 1731 of the obstructing material \n173m in tube 173t is selected to provide sufficient time for \nthe delivery balloon 172 to inflate and deliver the tissue \npenetrating members 40 into the intestinal wall IW before \nthe obstructing material dissolves to open valve 173. Typi \ncally, this will be close to the end 173e of the tube 173t, but \nnot quite so as to allow time for liquid to have to wick into \nthe tube lumen before it reaches material 173m. According \nto one or more embodiments, once the deflation valve 173 \nopens, it not only serves to deflate the delivery balloon 172 \nbut also the aligner balloon 160 and deployment balloon 130 \nsince in many embodiments, all three are fludicially con \nnected (aligner balloon being fludically connected to deliv \nery balloon 172 and the deployment balloon  130 being \nfludically connected to aligner balloon 160). Opening of the \ndeflation valve 173 can be facilitated by placing it on the end \n172e of the delivery balloon 172 that is forced out of capsule \n120 by inflation  of the aligner balloon  160 so that the \ndeflation valve has good exposure to liquids in the Small \nintestine.  Similar tube deflation  valves  173 can also  be \npositioned on one or both of aligner balloon 162 and the \ndeployment balloon  130.  In  these  later  two cases,  the \nobstructing material in the tube valve can be configured to \ndegrade over a time period to allow  sufficient  time for \ninflation of delivery balloon 172 and advancement of tissue \npenetrating members 140 into the intestinal wall. \n\nAdditionally, as further backup for insured deflation, one \nor more puncture elements 182 can be attached to the inside \nSurface 124 of the capsule Such that when a balloon (e.g., \nballoon  130,  160,  172) fully  inflates  it  contacts  and is \npunctured by the puncture element 182. Puncture elements \n182 can comprise short protrusions from surface 124 having \na pointed tip.  In another alternative or additional embodi \nment of means for balloon deflation, one or more of the \ntissue penetrating members 140 can be directly coupled to \nthe wall of 172w of balloon 172 and configured to tear away \nfrom the balloon when they detach, tearing the balloon wall \nin the process. \n\nA discussion will now be presented of tissue penetrating \nmembers 140. Tissue penetrating member 140 can be fab \nricated from various drugs and other therapeutic agents 101, \none or more pharmaceutical excipients (e.g., disintegrants, \nstabilizers, etc.) and one or more biodegradable polymers. \nThe later materials chosen to confer desired structural and \nmaterial properties to the penetrating member (for example, \ncolumn strength for insertion into the intestinal  wall, or \nporosity and hydrophilicity for control the release of drug). \nReferring now to FIGS. 18a-18?. in many embodiments, the \npenetrating member 140 can be formed to have a shaft 144 \nand a needle tip 145 or other pointed tip 145 so as to readily \npenetrate  tissue  of the  intestinal  wall  as  shown in  the \nembodiment of FIG. 18a. In preferred embodiments, tip 145 \nhas a trocar shape as is shown in the embodiment of FIG. \n18c. Tip 145 may comprise various degradable materials \n(within the body of the tip or as a coating). Such as Sucrose \nor  other  Sugar which  increase  the  hardness  and tissue \npenetrating properties of the tip. Once placed in the intes \ntinal wall, the penetrating member 140 is degraded by the \ninterstitial fluids within the wall tissue so that the drug or \nother therapeutic agent 101 dissolves in those fluids and is \nabsorbed into the blood stream. One or more of the size, \nshape and chemical composition of tissue penetrating mem \nber 140 can be selected to allow for dissolution and absorp \ntion of drug 101 in a matter of seconds, minutes or even \nhours. Rates of dissolution can be controlled through the use \nof various disintegrants known in the pharmaceutical arts. \nExamples of disintegrants include, but are not limited to, \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n34 \nvarious starches such as Sodium starch glycolate and various \ncross linked polymers such as carboxymethyl cellulose. The \nchoice of disintegrants can be specifically adjusted for the \nenvironment within the wall of the small intestine. \n\nTissue penetrating member 140 will also typically include \none or more tissue retaining features 143 Such as a barb or \nhook to retain the penetrating member within the tissue of \nthe intestinal wall IW after advancement. Retaining features \n143 can be arranged in various patterns 143p to enhance \ntissue retention such as two or more barbs symmetrically or \notherwise distributed around and along member shaft 144 as \nis shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 18a and 18b. Addi \ntionally,  in  many embodiments, penetrating member will \nalso include a recess or other mating feature 146 for attach \nment to a coupling component on delivery mechanism 170. \nTissue penetrating member 140 is desirably configured to \nbe detachably coupled to platform 175 (or other component \nof delivery mechanism 170), so that after advancement of \nthe tissue penetrating member 140 into the intestinal wall, \nthe penetrating member detaches from the balloon. Detach \nability can be implemented by a variety of means including: \ni) the snugness or fit between the opening 174 in platform \n175 and the member shaft 144); ii) the configuration and \nplacement of tissue retaining features 143 on penetrating \nmember 140; and iii) the depth of penetration of shaft 144 \ninto the intestinal wall. Using one or more of these factors, \npenetrating member 140 be configured to detach as a result \nof balloon deflation (where the retaining features 143 hold \nthe penetrating member 140 in tissue as the balloon deflates \nor otherwise pulls back away from the intestinal wall) and/or \nthe forces exerted on capsule 120 by a peristaltic contraction \nof the small intestine. \n\nIn a specific embodiment, the detachability and retention \nof tissue penetrating member 140 in the intestinal wall IW \ncan be enhanced by configuring the tissue penetrating mem \nber shaft 144 to have an inverse taper 144t as is shown in the \nembodiment of FIG. 18c. The taper 144t on the shaft 144 is \nconfigured such that the application of peristaltic contractile \nforces from the intestinal wall on the shaft result in the shaft \nbeing forced inward (e.g., Squeezed inward). This is due to \nthe conversion by shaft taper 144t of the laterally applied \nperistaltic force PF to an orthogonal force OF acting to force \nthe shaft inward into the intestinal wall. In use, such inverse \ntapered shaft configurations serve to retain tissue penetrating \nmember 140 within the intestinal wall so as to detach from \nplatform 175 (or other component of delivery mechanism \n170) upon deflation of balloon 172. In additional embodi \nments, tissue penetrating members 140 having an inverse \ntapered shaft may also include one or more retaining fea \ntures  143  to  further enhance the retention  of the tissue \npenetrating member within intestinal wall IW once inserted. \nAs described above, in various embodiments, tissue pen \netrating member 140 can be fabricated from a number of \ndrugs and other therapeutic agents 101. Also according to \none or more embodiments, the tissue penetrating member \nmay be fabricated entirely from drug 101 or may have other \nconstituent components as well, e.g., various pharmaceutical \nexcipients (e.g., binders, preservatives, disintegrants, etc.), \npolymers conferring desired mechanical properties, etc. Fur \nther, in various embodiments one or more tissue penetrating \nmembers 140 can carry the same or a different drug 101 (or \nother therapeutic agent) from other tissue penetrating mem \nbers. The former configuration allows for the delivery of \ngreater amounts of a particular drug 101, while the later, \nallows two or more different drugs to be delivered into the \nintestinal  wall at about the same time to  facilitate  drug \ntreatment regimens requiring Substantial concurrent delivery \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n35 \nof multiple drugs. In embodiments of device 110, having \nmultiple delivery assemblies 178 (e.g., two, one on each face \nof balloon  172), a  first  assembly 178  can carry  tissue \npenetrating members having a first drug 101 and a second \nassembly 178\" can carry tissue penetrating members having \na second drug 101. \n\nTypically, the drug or other therapeutic agent 101 carried \nby the tissue penetrating member 140 will be mixed in with \na biodegradable material  105 to  form tissue penetrating \nmember 140. Material 105 may include one or more biode \ngradable polymers such as  PGLA, cellulose,  as well as \nSugars  such  as  maltose or other biodegradable material \ndescribed herein or known in the art. In such embodiments, \nthe penetrating member 140 may comprise a substantially \nheterogeneous mixture of drug 101 and biodegradable mate \nrial 105. Alternatively, the tissue penetrating member 140 \nmay include a portion 141 formed substantially from bio \ndegradable material 105 and a separate section 142 that is \nformed from or contains drug 101 as shown in the embodi \nment of FIG. 18d. In one or more embodiments, section 142 \nmay correspond to a pellet, slug, cylinder or other shaped \nsection  142s of drug 101.  Shaped section  142s may be \npre-formed as a separate section which is then inserted into \na cavity 142c in tissue penetrating member 140 as is shown \nin the embodiments of FIGS. 18e and 18f. Alternatively \nsection 142s may be formed by adding of drug preparation \n100 to cavity 142c. In embodiments, where drug preparation \n100 is added to cavity 142c, preparation may be added in as \na powder, liquid, or gel which is poured or injected into \ncavity 142c. Shaped section 142s may be formed of drug \n101 by itself or a drug preparation containing drug 101 and \none or more binders, preservatives, disintegrates and other \nexcipients.  Suitable  binders  include  polyethylene glycol \n(PEG) and other binders  known in  the  art.  In  various \nembodiments, the PEG or other binder may comprise in the \nrange of about 10 to 90% weight percent of the section 142s, \nwith a preferred embodiment for insulin preparations of \nabout 25-90 weight percent. Other excipients which may be \n\n5 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n35 \n\n36 \nbut the data in the table is also applicable to other embodi \nments of section 142 described herein. \n\nIn various embodiments, the weight of tissue penetrating \nmember 140 can range between about 10 to 15 mg, with \nlarger and Smaller weights contemplated. For embodiments \nof tissue penetrating member 140 fabricated from maltose, \nthe weight can range from about 11 to 14 mg. In various \nembodiments, depending upon the drug 101 and the desired \ndelivered dose, the weight percent of drug in member 140 \ncan  range from  about  0.1  to  about  15% In  exemplary \nembodiments these weight per cents correspond to embodi \nments of members 140 fabricated from maltose or PGLA, \nhowever they are also applicable to any of the biodegradable \nmaterials 105 used in the fabrication of members 140. The \nweight percent of drug or other therapeutic agent 101 in \nmember 140 can be adjusted depending upon the desired \ndose as well as to provide for structural and stoichiometric \nstability of the drug and also to achieve a desired concen \ntration profile of the drug in the blood or other tissue of the \nbody. Various stability  tests and models (e.g.,  using the \nArrhenius equation) known in the art and/or known rates of \ndrug chemical degradation may be used to make specific \nadjustments in the weight per cent range. Table 1  lists the \ndose and weight per cent range for insulin and number of \nother drugs which may be delivered by tissue penetrating \nmember 140. In some cases the tables lists ranges as well a \nsingle value for the dose. It should be appreciated that these \nvalues are exemplary and other values recited herein includ \ning the claims are also considered. Further, embodiments of \nthe invention also consider variations around these values \nincluding for example, t1, it5,  t10,  t25, and even larger \nvariations. Such variation are considered to fall within the \nScope of an embodiment claiming a particular value or range \nof values.

Further information on the weight per cent of excipi-  65  niques known in the art. For example, drug 101 (with or \nwithout biodegradable material 105) can be in solid form \nents in section 142 may be found in Table 1. For ease of \nand then formed into the shape of the tissue penetrating \ndiscussion, section 142 is referred to as a pellet in the table, \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n37 \nmember 140  using  molding,  compaction  or  other  like \nmethod with one or more binding agents added. Alterna \ntively, drug 101 and/or drug preparation 100 may be in solid \nor liquid form and then added to the biodegradable material \n105 in liquid form with the mixture then formed into the \npenetrating member 140 using molding or other forming \nmethod known in the polymer arts. \n\nDesirably, embodiments of the tissue penetrating member \n140 comprising a drug or other therapeutic agent 101 and \ndegradable material 105 are formed at temperatures which \ndo not produce any Substantial thermal degradation of drug \nincluding drugs such as various peptides and proteins. This \ncan be achieved through the use of room-temperature curing \npolymers and room temperature molding and solvent evapo \nration techniques known in the art.  In particular embodi \nments, the amount of thermally  degraded drug or other \ntherapeutic agent within the tissue penetrating member is \ndesirably less than about 10% by weight and more prefer \nably, less than 5% and still  more preferably less than 1%. \nThe thermal degradation temperature(s) for a particular drug \nare either known or can be determined using methods known \nin the art and then this temperature can be used to select and \nadjust  the  particular  polymer processing  methods (e.g., \nmolding, curing. Solvent evaporation methods etc.) to mini \nmize the temperatures and associated level of drug thermal \ndegradation. \n\nA description will be provided of delivery mechanism \n170. Typically, the mechanism will comprise a delivery \nassembly 178 (containing tissue penetrating members 140) \nthat is attached to delivery balloon 172 as is shown in the \nembodiment of FIGS. 16a and 16b. Inflation of the delivery \nballoon provides a mechanical force for engaging delivery \nassembly  172 outwards  from  the  capsule  and into  the \nintestinal wall IW so as to insert tissue penetrating members \n140 into the wall.  In  various embodiments, the delivery \nballoon 172 can have an elongated shape with two relatively \nflat faces 172f connected by an articulated accordion-like \nbody 172b. The flat faces 172f can be configured to press \nagainst the  intestinal  wall  (IW)  upon expansion of the \nballoon 172 so as to insert the tissue penetrating members \n(TPMs) 140 into the intestinal wall. TPMS 140 (either by \nthemselves or as part of a delivery assembly 178 described \nbelow) can be positioned on one or both faces  172f of \nballoon 172 to allow insertion of drug containing TPMs 40 \non opposite sides of the intestinal wall. The faces 172f of \nballoon 172 may have sufficient surface area to allow for \nplacement of a number of drug containing TPMS 140 on \neach face. \n\nReferring now to  FIG. 19, a  description will  now be \nprovided of the assembly of delivery assembly 178. In a first \nstep 300, one or more tissue penetrating members 140 can \nbe detachably  coupled to  a biodegradable advancement \nstructure 175 which may correspond to a support platform \n175 (also known as platform 175). In preferred embodi \nments, platform 175 includes one or more openings 174 for \ninsertion of members 140 as shown in step 300. Openings \n174 are sized to allow for insertion and retention of members \n140 in platform 175 prior to expansion of balloon 172 while \nallowing for their detachment from the platform upon their \npenetration into the intestinal wall. Support platform 175 \ncan then be positioned within a carrying structure 176 as \nshown in step 301. Carrying structure 176 may correspond \nto a well structure 176 having side walls 176s and a bottom \nwall 176b which define a cavity or opening 176c. Platform \n175 is desirably attached to inside surface of bottom wall \n176b using adhesive or other joining methods known in the \nart. Well structure 176 can comprise various polymer mate \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n38 \nrials and may be formed using vacuum forming techniques \nknown in the polymer processing arts.  In many embodi \nments, opening 176O can be covered with a protective film \n177 as shown in step 302. Protective film 177 has properties \nselected to function as a barrier to protect tissue penetrating \nmembers 140 from humidity and oxidation while still allow \ning tissue penetrating members 140 to penetrate the film as \nis described below. Film 177 can comprise various water \nand/or oxygen impermeable polymers which are desirably \nconfigured to be biodegradable in the small intestine and/or \nto pass inertly through the digestive tract. It may also have \na multi-ply construction with particular layers selected for \nimpermeability to a given Substance, e.g.,  oxygen, water \nvapor etc. In use, embodiments employing protective film \n177 serve to increase the shelf life of therapeutic agent 101 \nin tissue penetrating members 140, and in turn, the shelf life \nof device 110. Collectively, support platform 175 attached \ntissue penetrating members 140, well structure 176, and film \n177 can comprise a delivery assembly 178. Delivery assem \nblies 178 having one or more drugs or therapeutic agents 101 \ncontained within tissue penetrating member 40 or other drug \ndelivery means can be pre-manufactured, stored and Subse \nquently used for the manufacture of device 110 at a later \ndate. The shelf life of assembly 178 can be further enhanced \nby filling cavity 176c of the sealed assembly 178 with an \ninert gas such as nitrogen. \n\nReferring back to FIGS. 16a and 16b, assemblies 178 can \nbe positioned on one or both faces 172f of balloon 172. In \npreferred embodiments, assemblies 178 are positioned on \nboth faces 172f (as shown in FIG. 16a) so as to provide a \nsubstantially equal distribution of force to opposite sides of \nthe intestinal wall IW upon expansion of balloon 172. The \nassemblies 178 may be attached to faces 172fusing adhe \nsives or other joining methods known in the polymer arts. \nUpon expansion  of balloon  172,  TPMS 140 penetrate \nthrough  film  177,  enter the  intestinal  wall  IW and are \nretained there by retaining elements 143 and/or other retain \ning features of TPM 140 (e.g., an inverse tapered shaft 144t) \nsuch that they detach from platform 175 upon deflation of \nballoon 172. \n\nIn various embodiments, one or more of balloons 130, \n160 and 172 can be packed inside capsule 120 in a folded, \nfurled  or other  desired  configuration  to  conserve  space \nwithin the interior volume 124v of the capsule. Folding can \nbe done using preformed creases or other folding feature or \nmethod known in the medical balloon arts.  In particular \nembodiments, balloon 130, 160 and 172 can be folded in \nselected orientations to achieve one or more of the follow \ning: i) conserve space, ii) produce a desired orientation of a \nparticular  inflated  balloon;  and  iii)  facilitate  a  desired \nsequence of balloon inflations. The embodiments shown in \nFIGS. 15a-15f illustrate an embodiment of a method of \nfolding  and  various  folding  arrangements.  However,  it \nshould be appreciated that this folding arrangement and the \nresulting balloon orientations are exemplary and others may \nalso be used. In this and related embodiments, folding can be \ndone manually, by automated machine or a combination of \nboth. Also in many embodiments, folding can be facilitated \nby using a single multi-balloon assembly 7 (herein assembly \n7) comprising balloons 130, 160, 170; valve chamber 158 \nand assorted connecting tubings 162 as is  shown in the \nembodiments of FIGS. 13a and 13b. FIG. 13a shows an \nembodiment of assembly 7 having a single dome construc \ntion for balloon 130, while FIG. 13b shows the embodiment \nof assembly 7 having dual balloon/dome configuration for \nballoon 130. Assembly 7 can be fabricated using a thin \npolymer film which is vacuum-formed into the desired shape \n\n\fUS 9,486,414 B2 \n\n39 \nusing various vacuum forming and other related methods \nknown in the polymer processing arts.  Suitable polymer \nfilms include polyethylene films having a thickness in the \nrange of about  0.003  to  about 0.010\",  with a  specific \nembodiment of 0.005\".  In  preferred  embodiments,  the \nassembly is fabricated to have a unitary construction so as to \neliminate the need for joining one or more components of \nthe assembly (e.g., balloons 130,160, etc.). However, it is \nalso contemplated for assembly 7 to  be fabricated from \nmultiple portions (e.g., halves), or components (e.g., bal \nloons) which are then joined using various joining methods \nknown in the polymer/medical device arts. \n\nReferring now to FIGS. 15a-15f. 16a-16b and 17a-17b, in \na first folding step 210, balloon 160 is folded over onto valve \nfitting  158 with balloon  172 being flipped over to  the \nopposite side of valve fitting 158 in the process (see FIG. \n15a). Then in step 211, balloon 172 is folded at a right angle \nto the folded combination of balloon 160 and valve 158 (see \nFIG. 15b). Then, in step 212 for dual dome embodiments of \nballoon 130, the two halves 130' and 130\" of balloon 130 are \nfolded onto each other, leaving valve 150 exposed (see FIG. \n15c, for single dome embodiments of balloon 130, is folded \nover onto itself see FIG. 15e). A final folding step 213 can \nbe done whereby folded balloon 130 is folded over 180\u00b0 to \nthe opposite side of valve fitting 158 and balloon 160 to \nyield a final folded assembly 8 for dual dome configurations \nshown in the FIG. 15e and a final folded assembly 8 for \nsingle dome configurations shown in  FIGS. 15e and 15f. \nOne or more delivery assemblies 178 are then be attached to \nassembly 8 in  step  214 (typically  two the faces  72f of \nballoon 72)  to  yield a final  assembly 9 (shown in  the \nembodiments of FIGS. 16a and 16b) which is then inserted \ninto  capsule  120. After an  insertion  step  215,  the  final \nassembled version of device 110 with inserted assembly 9 is \nshown FIGS. 17a and 17b. \n\nReferring now to FIGS. 20a-20i, a description will be \nprovided of a method of using device 110 to deliver medi \ncation 101 to a site in the GI tract such as the wall of the \nsmall or large intestine.  It should be appreciated that the \nsteps and there order is exemplary and other steps and orders \nalso contemplated. After device 110 enters the small intes \ntine SI, the cap coating 120c' is degraded by the basic pH in \nthe upper Small intestine causing degradation of cap 120p' as \nshown in step 400 in FIG. 20b. Valve 150 is then exposed to \nfluids  in  the  Small  intestine  causing the  valve to begin \ndegrade as is shown in step 401 in FIG. 20c. Then, in step \n402, balloon 130 expands (due to generation of gas 169) as \nshown in FIG. 20d. Then, in step 403, section 160' of balloon \n160 begins to expand to start to push assembly 178 out of the \ncapsule body as shown in  FIG. 20e. Then, in step 404, \nsections 160' and 160\" of balloon 160 become fully inflated \nto completely push assembly 178 out of the capsule body \nextending the capsule length 1201 So as to serve to align \ncapsule lateral axis 120AL with the lateral axis of the small \nintestine LAI as shown in FIG. 20f. During this time, valve \n155 is  beginning to  fail  from the increased pressure in \nballoon 60 (due to the fact that the balloon has fully inflated \nand there is no other place for gas 169 to go). Then, in step \n405, valve 155 has completely opened, inflating balloon 172 \nwhich then pushes the now completely exposed assembly \n178 (having been pushed completely out of body 120p\") \nradially outward into the intestinal wall IW as shown in FIG. \n20g. Then, in step 406, balloon 172 continues to expand to \nnow advance tissue penetrating members into the intestinal \nwall IW as shown in FIG. 20h. Then, in step 407, balloon \n172, (along with balloons 160 and 130) has deflated pulling \nback and leaving tissue penetrating members retained in the \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n40 \nintestinal  wall IW. Also, the body portion  120p\" of the \ncapsule has completely degraded (due to degradation of \ncoating 120c\") along with other biodegradable portions of \ndevice 110. Any portion not degraded is  carried distally \nthrough the Small intestine by peristaltic contraction from \ndigestion and is ultimately excreted. \n\nThe foregoing description of various embodiments of the \ninvention has been presented for purposes of illustration and \ndescription. It is not intended to limit the invention to the \nprecise forms disclosed. Many modifications, variations and \nrefinements will be apparent to practitioners skilled in the \nart. For example, embodiments of the device can be sized \nand otherwise adapted for various pediatric and neonatal \napplications as well as various veterinary applications. Also \nthose skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain \nusing  no  more than  routine  experimentation,  numerous \nequivalents to the specific devices and methods described \nherein.

The result is that \nthe ideal therapeutic concentration is not consistently main \ntained,  there  is  a risk  of toxicity  associated  with high \nsystemic exposure to the drug, and the maintenance of a \nminimally  effective  concentration  is  dependent  upon \nrepeated administration at prescribed intervals. Patient com \npliance with a dosing regimen is difficult to ensure, espe \ncially where the course of therapy is long or of indeterminate \nor lifetime duration. There is a need for methods to deliver \nthese drugs more effectively, so that therapeutic concentra \ntions are maintained constantly in the tissues intended to be \ntreated  over an extended period  of time,  with  minimal \nVulnerability to the  vagaries of patient  compliance, and \nideally  with  minimal systemic exposure or exposure of \nuninvolved tissues and organs. \n\nModern drug discovery methods have led to the devel \nopment of many drugs which are far more potent, yet have \npoorer solubility, than drugs developed through traditional \nmedicinal chemistry methods. The development of these \noften-complex drugs has resulted in a need for methods to \ndeliver such drugs more effectively and efficiently as well. \nExtended-release  and controlled-release  drug delivery \nsystems  have  been  developed  to  address  these  needs. \nImplanted pumps and reservoirs, with various mechanisms \nfor regulating release of drugs, were among the first Solu \ntions to be developed. A wide variety of polymeric matrices, \npermeated with drug Substance, have also been developed \nwhich serve as implantable drug reservoirs. These polymeric \nimplants gradually release drug over the course of days, \nweeks, or months as the contained drug diffuses through and \nout of the matrix and into the Surrounding tissue. Three \nprincipal advantages provided by polymeric drug delivery \ncompositions are: \n\n(1)  Localized  delivery  of drug.  The product  can  be \nimplanted directly at the site where drug action is needed \nand hence systemic exposure of the drug can be reduced. \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n2 \nThis becomes especially important for toxic drugs which are \nrelated to various systemic side effects (such as the chemo \ntherapeutic drugs). \n\n(2) Sustained delivery of drug. The drug is released over \nextended periods, eliminating the need for multiple injec \ntions  or  oral  doses.  This  improves patient  compliance, \nespecially for drugs for chronic indications requiring fre \nquent  administration,  such  as  replacement  therapy  for \nenzyme or hormone deficiencies, or for extended antibiotic \ntreatments for Such tenacious diseases as tuberculosis. \n\n(3) Stabilization of the drug. The polymer matrix protects \nthe drug from the physiological environment, particularly \ncirculating enzymes, thereby improving stability in  vivo. \nThis makes the technology particularly attractive for the \ndelivery of labile proteins and peptides. \n\nFor the reasons above, the use of drug-infused polymer \nimplants as Sustained-release drug delivery devices is now \nwell established. One class of existing implants consists of \npreformed devices, ranging in size from matchstick-sized \ncylindrical rods such as the NorplantTM (levonorgestrel) and \nZoladexTM (goserelin  acetate)  implants,  to  microspheres \nsuch as are sold under the trade name Lupron Depot TM \n(leuprolide acetate). \n\nA major disadvantage of the macroscopic devices is their \nphysical size. Implantation of ZoladexTM rods, for instance, \nrequires the use of 14- or 16-gauge needles, and implanta \ntion of NorplantTM rods requires a surgical incision under \nlocal  anesthesia,  with  similar  Subsequent procedures  to \nreplace and/or remove them. (The ZoladexTM rods are bio \nerodable,  whereas  NorplantTM implants  are  based on a \nnon-bioerodable  silicone.)  Self-administration  of  such \nimplants is  not feasible, and the required intervention of \ntrained medical personnel greatly raises the cost and incon \nvenience of Such treatments. \n\nDrug-containing polymer implants have been reduced in \nsize by the expedient of grinding or milling a mixture of a \ndrug Substance and a gel-forming polymer at low tempera \nture, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,738. The resulting \npowder is then Suspended in a non-aqueous viscous solvent, \nSuch polyethylene glycol or a biocompatible oil, to obtain an \ninjectable composition. \n\nThe size  problem has  similarly  been overcome with \nmicrosphere implants, which can be administered (and self \nadministered where appropriate) by injection of an aqueous \nsuspension  of the  microspheres.  Lupron  Depot TM,  for \nexample, can be comfortably injected with a 22- or 23-gauge \nneedle. Because microspheres are not retrievable from the \nbody, they are necessarily based on bioerodable polymers. \nHowever, if an aqueous Suspension of microspheres is stored \nfor any length  of time,  the drug will  diffuse  from the \nparticles into the aqueous phase, furthermore the bioerod \nable  matrix itself is  prone to  hydrolysis  in  an aqueous \nenvironment. For these reasons, the injectable aqueous Sus \npension must be prepared at the time of injection. A second \ndisadvantage is the need for intramuscular injection. Finally, \npreparation of the microspheres is a complex process that is \nnot easily carried out reproducibly and reliably, and regu \nlatory  validation  of the manufacturing process  can be a \nsignificant obstacle to commercialization of Such products. \nAnother class of implants differing from pre-formed solid \ndevices is injectable liquids. Upon injection, these are trans \nformed in situ into Solid implants. This class of implants is \ntypified by compositions that transform from a drug-con \ntaining  liquid  phase to  a  drug-infused  gel  phase  upon \nexposure to a physiological environment. Such in situ gell \ning  compositions have several advantages:  they can be \nreadily and reliably manufactured by standard methods, they \n\n\fUS 9,566,336 B2 \n\n3 \ncan be stored in the form of easily-injected liquids, they can \nbe placed locally to achieve local delivery, and they can flow \nprior to gelling so as to fill Voids and create a less-visible \nSubcutaneous implant. In addition, a gelling, implant can \nserve  as  a  scaffold  for  cellular  colonization  and tissue \ngrowth. \n\nThere are various changes in conditions that can trigger \nthe gelling of an in situ gelling composition. Among these \nare changes in pH, osmolality, temperature, water concen \ntration, and alterations in specific ion concentrations. \n\nTemperature-sensitive in situ gelling compositions gen \nerally change from a Sol to a gel when the temperature \nexceeds a critical Solution temperature, which in the case of \ndrug delivery systems must be reasonably close to body \ntemperature. An example is the polyethylene oxide-polypro \npylene oxide block copolymer, sold under the trade name \nPluronicTM  F  127.  A 25-40% aqueous  solution  of this \nmaterial will gel at about body temperature, and drug release \nfrom Such a gel occurs over a period of up to one week. Such \ncompositions have the disadvantage that they must be care \nfully protected from premature gelling, through refrigerated \nstorage, and no bioerodable polymer has yet been developed \nthat undergoes a sol-gel transition at about body tempera \nture. \n\nA hydrogel whose drug release profile is both tempera \nture- and pH-modulated has also been reported (T. G. Park, \nin Biomaterials 20:517-521 (1999)). \n\nAnother class of compositions form gels upon contact \nwith water. For example, glycerol monooleate (GMO) con \ntaining a drug can be injected as a liquid lamellar phase, \nwhich upon injection and exposure to water forms a highly \nviscous cubic-phase hydrate. The drug is released from the \ncubic phase over the course of several days. An example of \nan injectable  drug depot product based on GMO is  the \nmetronidazole dental gel formulation marketed under the \ntrade name ElyZolTM. Due to the high water content of the \ncubic phase, GMO formulations are prone to  rapid drug \nrelease and are limited in duration of effect to no more than \nabout five days. \n\nThere are very few biocompatible liquid crystal compo \nsitions that meet the requirement for phase transition to a \nSufficiently viscous state at physiological conditions. Poly \nmers that precipitate upon contact with water, on the other \nhand, are numerous, and present a more versatile approach \nto the formulation of compositions that gel upon contact \nwith water. Approaches based on in situ gelling composi \ntions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,938,763, 5,077,049, \n5,278,202, 5,324,519 and 5,780,044, all of which are incor \nporated herein by reference. \n\nFor example, the AtrigelTM drug delivery system consists \nof a bioerodable poly(DL-lactide-glycolide) (PLGA) copo \nlymer (75:25 molar ratio) dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrroli \ndone (NMP). Pharmaceuticals  may be blended into  this \nPLGA solution at the point of manufacture, or they may be \nadded by the physician at the time of use. The liquid product \nis  injected  Subcutaneously  or  intramuscularly  through  a \nsmall gauge needle, whereupon displacement of the NMP \ncarrier with water in the tissue fluids causes the PLGA to \nprecipitate, forming a solid film or implant. The drug incor \nporated within the implant is then released in a controlled \nmanner as the polymer matrix erodes with time in the body. \nPLGA-based implants of this type can release drug over a \nperiod of several months. An example of a product employ \ning this technology is  the leuprolide acetate formulation \nmarketed under the trade name EligardTM. \n\nThe AtrigelTM system uses N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) \nas a solvent for the PLGA copolymer. NMP is  a water \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n4 \nmiscible, low-molecular-weight and low-viscosity solvent \nthat rapidly diffuses from the implant. Rapid solvent escape \nfrom the injected composition can lead to rapid and uneven \nprecipitation of the polymer, shrinking of the implant, and \nlocal irritation or even necrosis due to exposure of tissues to \na high local concentration of Solvent. \nThe use of liquid polymers as solvents for in situ gel \nforming compositions has been described in U.S. Pat. No. \n5,607,686 and in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/169,012 (US \n2003/0082234), corresponding to international patent appli \ncation PCT/KR00/01508 (WO 01/45742). However, accord \ning to these patents, polyethylene glycol is not suitable as a \nSolvent for PLGA. \n\nIn situ polymer-precipitation systems solve many of the \nproblems associated with implants, but some difficulties \nremain. There is  a need for in situ gelling drug delivery \nsystems  with improved properties,  a simple preparation \nprocedure and low toxicity of excipient. \n\nPEGs have the advantage of solubilizing different drugs \nthan NMP; in particular pegylated proteins can be expected \nto be more soluble and/or miscible in PEGs than in NMP. An \nadditional advantage is that PEGs are available in different \nmolecular weights and have different viscosities. In many \ninstances it important to be able to control the viscosity of \nthe injected gelling agent, which is not possible with NMP. \n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \n\nThe morphology of the polymer gel produced during the \nprecipitation process is dependent upon the nature of the \norganic solvent, which can vary from a dense sponge-like \nstructure to an open meshwork with numerous voids and \nchannels (P. D. Graham et al., J. Controlled Release 58:233 \n245 (1999)). This morphology in turn affects both the initial \nburst and the sustained release kinetics of the gel. Solvents \nused to date for this purpose have largely been selected from \nthe chemists traditional  menu of low-molecular weight \nspecies, such as NMP, DMA, alcohols, and the like,  as \ndescribed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,044. \n\nApplicants have found that polyethylene glycol can serve \nas the solvent for PLGA, and have found that the gel phase \nproduced upon exchange of the PEG with water exhibits \ndesirable  sustained-release  kinetics  for  small-molecule \ndrugs. \n\nAccordingly, the present invention provides an in situ \ngelling drug delivery formulation comprising a drug Sub \nstance and a PLGA polymer, dissolved dispersed or Sus \npended in  PEG as  the  liquid  phase solvent.  In  certain \nembodiments, the liquid phase solvent may include, or even \nconsist  essentially  of  a prodrug of the  drug Substance \ncombined with PEG. The compositions of the invention, on \ncontact with water or bodily fluids, undergo exchange of the \nPEG for water, resulting in precipitation of the both the \npolymer and the drug and Subsequent formation of a gel \nphase within which the drug Substance is incorporated. The \ndrug Substance Subsequently diffuses from the gel over an \nextended period of time. \n\nThe present invention also provides methods for making \nin situ gelling drug delivery formulations comprising a drug \nsubstance and a  PLGA polymer, dissolved dispersed or \nsuspended in PEG as the liquid phase solvent. The invention \nalso provides methods for preparing Sustained-release drug \ndepots in situ by the use of Such formulations. \n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n\n65 \n\nFIG. 1 shows the release profiles for morphine from three \ndifferent morphine-diclofenac co-drug/PLGA (70:30)/PEG \n400 formulations. \n\n\fUS 9,566,336 B2 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n5 \nFIG. 2 shows the release profile for morphine from a \nmorphine-diclofenac co-drug/PLGA (50:50)/PEG 400 for \nmulation (5% wily PLGA in PEG). \n\nFIG. 3 shows the release profile for morphine from a \nmorphine-diclofenac co-drug/PLGA (70:30)/DMA formula \ntion. \n\nFIG. 4 shows the release profile for morphine from a \nmorphine-diclofenac co-drug/PLGA (70:30)/benzyl benzo \nate formulation (20% w/v PLGA in benzyl benzoate). \n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE \nINVENTION \n\nThe present invention provides injectable in situ gelling \npharmaceutical compositions, comprising: (a) a drug Sub \nstance; (b) a liquid, semi-solid, or wax polyethylene glycol \n(PEG); and (c) a biocompatible and bioerodable polymer \nthat is dissolved, dispersed, or suspended in the PEG. \n\nA\u201cliquid' PEG is a polyethylene glycol that is a liquid at \n20-30\u00b0  C.  and  ambient  pressure.  In  certain  preferred \nembodiments, the average MW of the liquid PEG is between \nabout 200 and about 400. The polyethylene glycol may be \nlinear or it  may be a bioabsorbable branched PEG, for \nexample as disclosed in U.S. Patent application No. 2002/ \n0032298. In certain alternative embodiments the PEG may \nbe a semi-solid or wax, in which case the M will be larger, \nfor example 3,000 to  6,000.  It  will  be understood that \ncompositions comprising semi-solid and waxy PEGS may \nnot be amenable to  injection,  and will  accordingly  be \nimplanted by alternative means. \n\nIn certain embodiments, the drug Substance is dissolved in \nthe polyethylene glycol, while in other embodiments the \ndrug substance is dispersed or suspended in the PEG in the \nform of solid particles. In yet other embodiments, the drug \nSubstance may be encapsulated or otherwise incorporated \ninto  particles,  such as  microspheres,  nanospheres,  lipo \nSomes, lipospheres, micelles, and the like,  or it  may be \nconjugated to a polymeric carrier. Any such particles are \npreferably less than about 500 microns in diameter, more \npreferably less than about 150 microns. \n\nThe present invention also provides for macroscopic drug \ndelivery devices, for example in the form of hollow par \nticles,  capsules or open tubes,  which contain an in situ \ngelling composition of the invention. The devices may be \npermeable to the drug Substance, or they may be imperme \nable with one or more openings through which the drug \nsubstance may exit the device. Such devices, which are \nwell-known in the art, provide additional control over the \nrelease rate of the drug substance, by controlling the diffu \nsion rate and/or Surface area through which the drug Sub \nstance is released. \n\nThe drug Substance in certain embodiments is a peptide or \nprotein, which optionally may be pegylated, while in other \nembodiments the drug Substance is a prodrug or a co-drug. \nThe drug Substance may be in the form of a salt, which may \nbe a low-solubility salt. In certain embodiments exemplified \nherein, the drug Substance is the diclofenate ester of mor \nphine. \n\nThe compositions of the invention may optionally contain \nadditives, such as pore-forming agents (e.g., Sugars, salts, \nand water-soluble polymers) and release rate modifiers (e.g., \nsterols, fatty acids, glycerol esters, and the like). \n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method for \nadministering a drug Substance to a Subject, which com \nprises injecting into the Subject a composition comprising \n(a) a drug Substance; (b) a liquid PEG, and (c) a biocom \npatible and bioerodable PLGA polymer that is dissolved in \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n6 \nthe PEG. As used herein, \u201csubject\u201d refers to both human and \nanimal patients to whom the drug is to be administered. \n\nIn yet another aspect, the invention provides a method for \nforming a polymeric Sustained-release drug delivery gel in a \nSubject, which comprises injecting into the Subject a com \nposition comprising (a) a drug Substance; (b) a liquid PEG, \nand (c) a biocompatible and bioerodable PLGA polymer that \nis dissolved in the polyethylene glycol. \n\nThe present invention also provides for the co-adminis \ntration of a PEG/polymer/drug fluid with an aqueous fluid, \nwhich may be for example normal saline or a hydrogel. In \nthis embodiment, the two fluids are either administered at \nthe same time via a double lumen needle, or mixed imme \ndiately before administration. The two fluids  may be in \ncontained in attached Syringes. Co-administration reduces \nthe local irritation that may be caused by direct application \nof highly concentrated PEGs. \n\nThe polymer may be any biocompatible PLGA polymer \nthat is soluble in or miscible with PEG, and is less soluble \nin water. It is preferably water-insoluble, and is preferably a \nbioerodable polymer. The carboxyl termini of the lactide \nand  glycolide-containing  polymer  may  optionally  be \ncapped, e.g., by esterification, and the hydroxyl termini may \noptionally be capped, e.g., by etherification or esterification. \nPreferably the polymer is PLGA having a lactide:glycolide \nmolar ratio of between 20:80 and 90:10, more preferably \nbetween 50:50 and 85:15. \n\nBioerodable  polymers  are  polymers  which  gradually \ndegrade to Smaller chemical fragments when placed in the \nsubject\u2019s  body.  Two types  of degradable polymers  are \nincluded  under  this  definition:  biodegradable  polymers \n(whose biodegradation is enzymatically mediated) and bio \nabsorbable polymers (which degrade to Smaller fragments in \nthe presence of water and/or other chemical species in the \nbody). Some bioerodable polymers, e.g., certain block co \npolymers, may be subject to both modes of degradation. \n\nBiocompatible polymers are those polymers which, when \ninjected or implanted in the Subject\u2019s body, do not cause \ninflammation or irritation, do not induce an immune reac \ntion, and do not exhibit toxicity. \n\nThe in situ gelling compositions of the present invention \nare suitable for delivering Small organic molecules as well as \npeptides, proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids. The \ndrug Substance may be a pharmaceutically active Substance, \na pro-drug that is converted in vivo into a pharmaceutically \nactive Substance, or a co-drug that is converted in vivo into \ntwo or more pharmaceutically active Substances. By co-drug \nis meant a combination of two or more drugs whose mol \necules are physically linked, for example by covalent or \nionic bonds. Examples of Suitable co-drugs are described in \nU.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/134,033 (publication US \n2003/0039689) and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/349, \n202, which are incorporated herein by reference. The drug \nsubstance may be soluble or insoluble in PEG.

B. Sloan (Ed.), \nDrugs and the Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol 53 (Marcel \nDekker). It will be appreciated that the rate of cleavage will \nvary depending on the precise structures of the active agent \nand the polyoxyethylene ether, and on the nature of the \nlinker or bond L and the point(s) of attachment. The effi \nciency  of prodrug  cleavage  of linkers  for any  specific \nembodiment can be readily determined by those of skill in \nthe art; for a review of methods see A. Stichcomb, 2003, \nPharm Res. 20:1113-1118. \n\nThe linker or bond L. may be attached to any suitable \nheteroatom present in the topically active agent that carries \nan exchangeable hydrogen, such as \u2014OH, SH, NH, and \nCOOH groups.

Examples include but are \nnot limited to structures IV and V shown below: \n\n12 \ngroup on a polyoxyethylene ether residue, which itself is \nformed by removal of a hydrogen atom from a hydroxyl \ngroup from the polyoxyethylene ether. In this sense, the term \n\u201cresidue' as used herein is analogous to the sense of the \nword as it is used in peptide and protein chemistry to refer \nto a residue of an amino acid in a peptide. \n\nThe terms \u201clinker  and \u201clinkage,\u201d which are used inter \nchangeably herein, refer to a direct bond or to a multivalent \ngroup of atoms incorporating and connecting the functional \ngroups of the active drug Substance and a polyoxyethylene \nether, which is metabolized under physiological conditions \nto release the active agent A'. In certain embodiments, the \nlinker is a Substantially linear moiety having no more than \n25 atoms, more preferably less  than  10 atoms. Preferred \nlinkers are ones which, upon release of the topically active \nagent, and when further metabolized, generate byproducts \nthat are non-toxic and inert at the effective dosing concen \ntration. Direct bonds between the residue A and the poly \noxyethylene moiety S are particularly preferred. \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\nEXAMPLES \n\nExample 1 \n\nEvaluation of Solubility of PLGA in Organic \nSolvents \n\nA sample of PLGA polymer was added to the indicated \nSolvent and overnight at room temperature, and the resulting \nmixture was examined for undissolved material.

The use of prodrug linkages may \nalso lower the melting point of a Solid drug Substance, or \nincrease the solubility of a drug Substance in physiological \nfluids, thereby improving the injectability of the drug sub \nStance. \n\nThe drug Substance may be dissolved, dispersed or Sus \npended in the biocompatible core, whereupon it may leach \nout of the core and into Surrounding fluid. In certain embodi \nments, the drug Substance may rapidly  escape from an \ninjection mixture after injection into a physiological system. \nThe term \u201cresidue' when applied to an agent means a part \nof an agent that is Substantially identical to the agent from \nwhich it is derived, with minor differences arising by virtue \nof having one or more atoms removed to provide points of \nattachment for the linker(s) L. Typically, at least one func \ntional group of the residue will be altered (relative to the \nparent pharmaceutically active agent) to accommodate the \ncovalent linker. This will typically involve removal of an \nexchangeable hydrogen and/or a single heteroatom, leaving \na free Valence for attachment of the linkage L. For instance, \nwhere the drug Substance includes a carboxylate functional \ngroup, the residue of the agent formed by removal of a \nhydroxyl group may form an ester bond with a hydroxyl \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n\fUS 9,566,336 B2 \n\n13 \ndiclofenac  co-drug in  PLGA (70:30)/PEG  400 solution \n(-10% (w/v) PLGA in PEG). Formulation C was formulated \nat about 10 mg/ml morphine-diclofenac co-drug in PLGA \n(70:30)/PEG 400 solution (-20% (w/v) PLGA in PEG). \n\nEach formulation was loaded into a 1-ml syringe, and 100 \nul aliquot was injected into a tube containing 10 ml of 10% \nplasma in HA (hyaluronic acid) phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. \nThe samples were placed in a water bath at 37\u00b0C. for release \nstudy. At each time point, the entire release medium was \nremoved and replaced with 10 ml fresh buffer. The removed \nSolution  was analyzed for morphine, diclofenac and the \nco-drug contents by HPLC. \n\nThe results are shown graphically in FIG. 1. Morphine \nreleased much faster from the formulation A with 5% (w/v) \nPLGA. At day 18 about 80% morphine released. The release \nprofiles of formulations B and C were very similar. At day \n24 about 80% of the  morphine was released from both \nformulations. However, the higher concentration of PLGA at \n20% (w/v) reduced initial burst significantly. \n\nNo morphine-diclofenac co-drug was detected since the \nco-drug was hydrolyzed in the release medium. Diclofenac \ndata (not shown) was not reliable, due to the high protein \nbinding of diclofenac in the serum medium. \n\nExample 3 \n\nRelease Rate Profile for Morphine-Diclofenac \nCo-Drug from PLGA (50:50)/PEG Formulation \n\nThe formulation was prepared with 12 mg/ml morphine \ndiclofenac  co-drug in  PLGA (50:50)/PEG  400 solution \n(-5% (w/v) PLGA in PEG) and loaded into a 1-ml syringe, \nand 100 ul aliquot was injected into a test tube containing 10 \nml of 10% plasma in HA (hyaluronic acid) phosphate buffer, \npH 7.4. The samples were placed in a 37\u00b0C. water bath. At \neach time point, the entire release medium was removed and \nreplaced with  10 ml fresh buffer. The removed solutions \nwere analyzed for morphine, diclofenac and the co-drug \ncontents by HPLC. \n\nThe results are shown graphically in FIG. 2. As compared \nto the results from Example 2, morphine release was much \nslower in this PLGA (50:50) formulation, even where the \nPLGA concentration was low as ~5% (w/v). About 80% of \nthe morphine was released over 40 days. It is most likely that \nthe higher molecular weight of PLGA (50:50) reduces the \nrelease rate of morphine. \n\nExample 4 \n\nRelease Profiles for Morphine-Diclofenac Co-Drug \nfrom PLGA (70:30) with Non-Polymeric Solvents \n\nTwo formulations were evaluated for this study: Formu \nlation A was formulated at about 8 mg/ml morphine-di \nclofenac  co-drug in  PLGA (70:30)/DMA solution  (40% \n(w/v) PLGA in DMA). Formulation B was formulated at \nabout  10 mg/ml morphine-diclofenac co-drug  in  PLGA \n(70:30)/benzyl benzoate solution (20% (w/v) PLGA in ben \nZyl benzoate). \n\nEach formulation was loaded into a 1-ml syringe, and 100 \nul aliquot was injected into a tube containing 10 ml of 10% \nplasma in HA (hyaluronic acid) phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. \n\n14 \nThe samples were placed in a water bath at 37\u00b0C. for release \nstudy. At each time point, the entire release medium for the \nDMA formulation was removed and replaced with 10 ml \nfresh buffer, while only 5 ml release medium for the benzyl \nbenzoate formulation was removed and replaced with 5 ml \nfresh  buffer.  The removed solutions  were analyzed for \nmorphine, diclofenac and the co-drug contents by HPLC. \nThe results are shown in FIGS. 3 (DMA) and 4 (benzyl \nbenzoate). The morphine release profile from the DMA \nformulation is very similar to that from the formulation with \n5% (w/v) PLGA in Example 2, although the concentration of \nPLGA in the DMA formulation was 40% (w/v). However, \nmorphine release was slower in the benzyl benzoate formu \nlation. At day 35 about 46% morphine was released. DMA \nis more hydrophilic than benzyl benzoate, which is an oily \nsolvent. By adding these organic solvent(s) to PLGA for \nmulations, drug release rate can be adjusted. \n\nAll references, publications, and patents cited herein are \nhereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Many embodiments \nprovide  a  swallowable  device  for delivering the agents . \nParticular embodiments provide a  swallowable device such \nas a  capsule for delivering drugs into the intestinal wall or \nother GI lumen .  Embodiments also  provide  various  drug \npreparations that are  configured to  be contained within  the \ncapsule ,  advanced from  the capsule  into  the intestinal wall \nand  degrade to  release  the drug into  the bloodstream  to \nproduce a  therapeutic  effect .  The preparation  can be oper \nably  coupled to  delivery means having a  first configuration \nwhere the preparation  is  contained  in  the  capsule  and  a \nsecond configuration where the preparation is  advanced out \nof the capsule into the intestinal wall . Embodiments of the \ninvention  are particularly  useful for the delivery  of drugs \nwhich are poorly absorbed , tolerated and / or degraded within \nthe GI tract . \n\n20 Claims , 46 Drawing Sheets \n\n\f( 56 ) \n\n/ 2004  Prausnitz  et al . \n\nReferences Cited \nU .

More specifically , embodiments of the \ncomprising a capsule , an actuator and an embodiment of the \ninvention relate  to  swallowable drug delivery  devices  for \ntherapeutic agent preparation . The actuator is responsive to \ndelivering drugs to  the small intestine . \nWhile there has been an increasing development of new  40  a  condition in the small intestine such as pH so  as to actuate \ndelivery of the therapeutic agent preparation into the wall of \ndrugs in  recent years  for  the treatment of a  variety  of \nthe small intestine . In specific embodiments , the actuator can \ndiseases , many have limited application because they cannot \ncomprise a release element or coating on the capsule which \nbe given orally . This is due to  a number of reasons including : \npoor oral toleration  with  complications including  gastric \nis  degraded by a  selected pH  in  the small intestine . Once \nirritation  and bleeding ; breakdown / degradation of the drug  45  degraded ,  the element or coating initiates  delivery  of the \ntherapeutic agent preparation by one or more delivery means \ncompounds in the stomach ; and poor , slow  or erratic absorp - \nsuch as the by expansion  of one or more balloons that are \ntion  of the drug .  Conventional alternative  drug delivery \noperably coupled to tissue penetrating members that contain \nmethods such  as  intravenous  and  intramuscular  delivery \nhave a  number of drawbacks including pain  and  risk  of \nthe  therapeutic  agent preparation  and  are  configured  to \ninfection  from  a  needle  stick ,  requirements for the use of 50  penetrate  and  be advanced  into  the  intestinal wall  upon \nexpansion of the balloon . Once the tissue penetrating mem \nsterile technique and the requirement and associated risks of \nbers are in  the intestinal wall , they  degrade to  release the \nmaintaining an IV line in  a  patient for an extended period of \ntherapeutic  agent into  the bloodstream . Because the thera \ntime .  While  other  drug  delivery  approaches  have  been \nemployed  such as implantable drug delivery pumps , these \npeutic agent preparation is delivered directly into  the wall of \n55  the small intestine ,  the time period  ( described herein  as \napproaches require  the semi - permanent implantation  of a \n?mar )  for  achieving  the  maximum  concentration  of the \ndevice  and  can  still  have many of the limitations of IV \ntherapeutic agent in  the bloodstream  or other location in the \ndelivery . Thus , there is a need for an improved method for \nbody is  shorter than a corresponding time period for achiev \ndelivery of drugs and other therapeutic agents , including a \nneed  for improved  delivery  of exenatide for treatment of \ning such  a maximum  concentration  when the therapeutic \ndiabetes or other blood  glucose regulation disorders . \n60  agent is  non - vascularly injected  into  the body such as by \nintramuscular or subcutaneous injection . In  various embodi \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \nments , the time period for achieving Cmax by insertion of the \ntherapeutic preparation into  the intestinal wall using one or \nmore embodiments of the invention ( such as an embodiment \nEmbodiments of the invention provide devices , systems , \nkits and methods for delivering drugs and other therapeutic  65  of the swallowable device ) can be 80 % , 50 %  ,  30 % , 20  or \neven  10 %  of the time period for achieving a  Cmax through \nagents to  various locations in  the body .

More specifically ,  embodiments of the \ncomprising a capsule , an actuator and an embodiment of the \ninvention relate  to  swallowable drug delivery  devices for  40  therapeutic agent preparation .  The actuator is responsive to \ndelivering drugs to  the small intestine . \na condition in  the small intestine such as pH  so as to  actuate \ndelivery of the therapeutic agent preparation into  the wall of \nWhile there has been an increasing development of new \ndrugs in  recent years  for  the treatment of a  variety  of \nthe small intestine . In specific embodiments , the actuator can \ncomprise a release element or coating on the capsule which \ndiseases , many have limited application because they cannot \nbe given orally . This is due to a number of reasons including :  45  is degraded by a selected pH  in  the small intestine . Once \ndegraded , the element or coating initiates delivery of the \npoor oral toleration  with  complications including gastric \ntherapeutic agent preparation by one or more delivery means \nirritation  and bleeding ; breakdown / degradation of the drug \nsuch as the by expansion of one or more balloons that are \ncompounds in  the stomach ; and poor , slow  or erratic absorp - \ntion  of the  drug .  Conventional alternative  drug  delivery \noperably coupled to tissue penetrating members that contain \nmethods such  as  intravenous  and intramuscular  delivery  50  the  therapeutic  agent preparation  and  are  configured  to \npenetrate  and be advanced  into  the  intestinal wall upon \nhave a  number of drawbacks including pain  and risk  of \nexpansion of the balloon . Once the tissue penetrating mem \ninfection  from  a  needle  stick , requirements for the use of \nsterile technique and the requirement and associated risks of \nbers are in  the intestinal wall , they  degrade to  release the \ntherapeutic agent into the bloodstream . Because the thera \nmaintaining an IV line in  a  patient for an  extended period of \ntime . While  other  drug  delivery  approaches have  been  55  peutic agent preparation is delivered directly into  the wall of \nthe small intestine ,  the time period  ( described herein  as \nemployed such  as implantable drug delivery pumps , these \nCmax )  for  achieving  the  maximum  concentration  of the \napproaches require  the semi - permanent implantation  of a \ndevice  and  can  still  have many of the limitations of IV \ntherapeutic agent in  the bloodstream  or other location in  the \nbody is  shorter than a  corresponding time period for achiev \ndelivery .  Thus , there is a  need for an improved method for \ndelivery of drugs and other therapeutic agents , including a  60  ing  such  a maximum  concentration when  the therapeutic \nagent is non - vascularly  injected  into  the body such  as by \nneed for improved delivery of growth hormone for treatment \nof growth hormone deficiency and related  disorders . \nintramuscular or subcutaneous injection .

The actuator is responsive to \ndelivering drugs to  the small intestine . \na condition in the small intestine such  as pH  so as to  actuate \ndelivery of the therapeutic agent preparation into the wall of \nWhile there has been an increasing development of new \nthe small intestine . In specific embodiments , the actuator can \ndrugs in  recent years  for  the treatment of a  variety  of \ncomprise a release element or coating on the capsule which \ndiseases , many have limited application because they cannot \nbe given orally . This is due to a number of reasons including :  40  is degraded by a selected pH  in  the small intestine . Once \ndegraded , the element or coating initiates delivery of the \npoor oral toleration  with  complications including gastric \ntherapeutic agent preparation by one or more delivery means \nirritation  and bleeding ; breakdown / degradation of the drug \nsuch as the by expansion of one or more balloons that are \ncompounds in  the stomach ; and poor , slow or erratic absorp - \noperably coupled to tissue penetrating members that contain \ntion  of  the  drug .  Conventional alternative  drug  delivery \nmethods such  as intravenous and intramuscular  delivery  45  the  therapeutic  agent preparation  and  are  configured  to \npenetrate  and be advanced  into  the  intestinal wall upon \nhave a  number of drawbacks including pain  and  risk  of \nexpansion of the balloon . Once the tissue penetrating mem \ninfection  from  a  needle stick ,  requirements  for  the use of \nsterile technique and the requirement and associated risks of \nbers are in  the intestinal wall , they degrade to  release  the \ntherapeutic agent into the bloodstream . Because the thera \nmaintaining an IV line in  a  patient for an  extended period of \ntime .  While  other  drug  delivery  approaches  have  been  50  peutic agent preparation is delivered directly into  the wall of \nthe small intestine ,  the time period  ( described herein  as \nemployed such  as implantable drug delivery pumps , these \nCmax )  for  achieving  the maximum  concentration  of the \napproaches require  the semi - permanent implantation  of a \ndevice  and  can  still  have many of the limitations of IV \ntherapeutic agent in  the bloodstream  or other location in  the \nbody is shorter than a corresponding time period for achiev \ndelivery . Thus , there is a need for an improved method for \ndelivery of drugs and other therapeutic agents , including a  55  ing such  a maximum  concentration  when the therapeutic \nagent is non - vascularly  injected  into  the body such  as by \nneed for improved delivery  of interferons for treatment of \nintramuscular or subcutaneous injection .

Field of the Invention \nThe present invention relates to a device for controllable \ndispensing of active Substance, such as a chemical Sub \nstance, a medication, a drug, or the like, to a person or other \nmammal, and more particularly, the invention is related to a \nportable device usable for transdermal and subcutaneous \ndrug delivery or compound delivery in a programmable, \nautomated, and/or controllable manner including control of \nthe dose and timing of delivery to the patient. The invention \nfurther relates  to  the controllable stopping of compound \ndelivery to the body. The invention further relates to the field  35 \nof chronobiology  in  that  the  invention  systems  can be \ndesigned to modulate active agent delivery in accordance \nwith biological rhythms pursuant to automated and/or pre \nprogrammed dosage profiles. Bioactive substances are deliv \nered transdermally into a body in a manner that is synchro \nnized with biological processes and/or biological rhythms, \nand/or narcotic or other addiction cycles or other intra body \nor externally desired cycles So as to improve performance of \nthe substance in the body or otherwise achieve a desired \nresult  by  controlling  blood plasma concentrations  of a 45 \ncompound. The invention also relates to overcoming active \nagent tolerance, which may be experienced from continuous \nadministration,  overcoming active  agent  skin  irritation, \nwhich may be experienced from continuous administration \nby allowing skin rest periods, improve patient compliance,  50 \nand in some cases reducing the amount of drug needed per \ndose  due to  advantages  of biosynchronization  or  pro \ngrammed dosing. A programmable heating element may also \nbe utilized to automatically heat the skin at precise times or \nintervals to assist in permeation and/or aid in the stopping of 55 \ndosing. \n\n2. Relevant Background \nMedications provide effective treatments for a variety of \nillnesses. It is often preferred that medication is applied at a \ncertain time or with a certain time pattern and in a manner 60 \nthat keeps the concentration of medication at a certain value \nto achieve a desired therapeutic result most efficiently. There \nare some medications that are only able to release effective \npharmaceutical Substances over a long period of time. Fur \nther, there are effective substances that are partially or totally  65 \ninactivated following oral  ingestion by the highly acidic \nenvironment of the stomach or by the filter impact of the \n\n2 \nliver. In order to overcome such problems, drugs are admin \nistered by either by transdermal delivery through the skin \n(e.g.,  with a patch)  or Subcutaneously with a needle or \ncontinuously by drip, with these later two methods being \ncommon parenteral methods for drug delivery. For a long \nterm treatment, the parenteral methods may be uncomfort \nable for the patient because of the repeated injury by needle \ninjections and the limited liberty of action due to intravenous \ndrip apparatus. \n\nPatches are a form of transdermal drug delivery that is \napplied on the Surface of the skin. These patches are cap \nturing more and more attention in recent years because they \nare portable, comfortable, and suitable for patients with drug \ndelivery in continuous dosages over a relatively long period \nof time without requiring active participation of the patient. \nIn the last decade, portable dispensing systems have been \ndeveloped to provide a more flexible, precise and complex \nadministration of drugs. Generally, the dispensing systems \ncomprise a reservoir for a drug, a dispensing unit, and a \npatch  (or a membrane that  is  permeable  to  the  active \nsubstance, drug, or the like but relatively impermeable to a \nsolvent  in  which  the  active  substance  is  mixed in  the \nreservoir).  The reservoir through  the  dispensing unit  is \ninterconnected to the patch. The dispensing unit controls the \nreleasing of the drug in the reservoir to  the patch. The \nefficiency  for  patch  transdermal  drug  delivery  depends \nmainly on the diffusion  rate  of the effective substances \nthrough the skin. Maintenance of the concentration of the \neffective substances on the patch is essential to achieve the \ndesirable diffusion rate. However, it has proven problematic \nto effectively control the concentration of substances on the \npatch in an effective manner. Further, it has proven difficult \nto provide an inexpensive portable device that allows a user \nor patient to  easily  refill  the  reservoir and to  otherwise \nmaintain the device. \n\nIn the field of drug delivery, it is recognized that Supply \ning the drug in a correct temporal pattern is an important \nattribute  of any drug  delivery  methodology.  Controlled \nrelease drug delivery systems are intended to improve the \nresponse to a drug and/or lessen side effects of a drug. The \nrecurring interest in chronopharmacology demonstrates the \nfact that  biological  rhythms are an important aspect  of \nclinical pharmacology and should be taken into account \nwhen evaluating drug delivery systems (Hrushesky, W., J. \nCont. Rel. 19:363 (1992), Lemmer, B., Adv. Drug Del. Rev. \n6:19 (1991), Youn, C. B. J. Cont. Rel. 98 (3) 337 (2004) and \nYoun, C. B. J. Ed., \u201cChronopharmaceutics,\u201d John Wiley & \nSons, New York. \n\nThe onset and symptoms of diseases such as asthma \nattacks,  coronary  infarction,  angina pectoris,  stroke and \nVentricular tachycardia are circadian phase dependent. In \naddition, certain addictions (such as cigarette Smoking) have \ntimes of day based on a persons circadian rhythms when \nsymptoms peak. In humans, variations during the 24 h day \nin pharmacokinetics (chrono-pharmacokinetics) have been \nshown for cardiovascular active drugs (propranolol, nife \ndipine, Verapamil, enalapril, isosorbide 5-mononitrate and \ndigoxin),  anti-asthmatics  (theophylline  and terbutaline), \nanti-cancer drugs, psychotropics, analgesics, local anesthet \nics and antibiotics, to mention but a few. Even more drugs \nhave been shown to display significant variations in their \neffects throughout the day (chronopharmacodynamics and \nchronotoxicology) even after chronic application or constant \ninfusion (Ohdo, S. Drug Safety 26 (14) 999-1010 (2003)). \nMoreover, there is clear evidence that dosef concentration \nresponse relationships can be significantly modified based \non the time of day. Thus, circadian time has to be taken into \n\n\fUS RE46,217 E \n\n3 \naccount as an important variable influencing a drug's phar \nmacokinetics and its effects or side-effects (Bruguerolle, B., \nClin. Pharmacokinet. August 35 (2) 83-94 (1998)). \n\nStudies indicate that the onset of certain diseases show \nstrong circadian temporal dependency. This has led to the \nneed for timed patterning of drug delivery as opposed to \nconstant drug release (Lemmer B., Ciba Found Symp. 183: \n235-47; discussion 247-53 (1995). The term \u201ccontrolled \nrelease' refers generally to delivery mechanisms that make \nan active ingredient available to the biological system of a \nhost in a manner that Supplies the drug according to a desired \ntemporal pattern. Controlled release drug delivery systems \nmay be implemented using: a) instantaneous release sys \ntems; b) delayed release systems, and c) sustained release \nsystems.  In  most cases,  controlled  release  systems  are \ndesigned to maintain a Sustained plasma level of an active \ningredient in a drug within a human or animal host over a \nperiod of time. \n\nInstantaneous release refers  to  systems that  make the \nactive ingredient available immediately after administration \nto the biosystem of the host. Instantaneous release systems \ninclude continuous or pulsed intravenous infusion or injec \ntions. Such systems provide a great deal of control because \nadministration  can  be both  instantaneously  started  and \nstopped and the delivery rate can be controlled with great \nprecision. However, the administration is undesirably inva \nsive as they involve administration via a puncture needle or \ncatheter. \n\nDelayed release refers to systems in which the active \ningredient made available to the host at Some time after \nadministration. Such systems include oral as well as inject \nable  drugs  in  which the active  ingredient  is  coated or \nen-capsulated with a Substance that dissolves at a known rate \nso as to release the active ingredient after the delay. Unfor \ntunately, it is often difficult to control the degradation of the \ncoating or encapsulant after administration and the actual \nperformance will vary from patient to patient. \n\nSustained Release generally refers to  release of active \ningredient such that the level of active ingredient available \nto the host is maintained at some level over a period of time. \nLike delayed release systems, Sustained release systems are \ndifficult to control and exhibit variability from patient to \npatient. Due to the adsorption through the gastrointestinal \ntract, drug concentrations rise quickly in the body when \ntaking a pill, but the decrease is dependent on excretion and \nmetabolism, which cannot be controlled. In addition, the \nadsorption through the gastrointestinal tract in many cases \nleads to considerable side effects (such as ulcers), and can \nseverely damage the liver. \n\nTransdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) have been devel \noped primarily for Sustained release of drugs in situations \nwhere oral Sustained release systems are inadequate. In some \ncases,  drugs  cannot  be  effectively  administered  orally \nbecause the active ingredients are destroyed or altered by the \ngastrointestinal  system.  In  other cases the drug may be \nphysically or chemically  incompatible with the coatings \nand/or chelating agents used to implement Sustained release. \nIn other cases a transdermal delivery system may provide \nSustained release over a period of days or weeks whereas \norally administered drugs may offer Sustained performance \nover only a few hours. A wide variety of active substances \ncan be delivered through transdermal systems so long as the \nactive Substance can be provided in a form that can cross the \nskin barrier, see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,638,528, which \nis incorporated herein by reference. \n\nIn most cases transdermal delivery systems are passive, \ntaking the form of a patch that is attached to the skin by an \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n4 \nadhesive. The TTS includes a quantity of the active sub \nstance, along with a Suitable carrier if need be, in a reservoir, \nmatrix or in the adhesive itself.  Once applied, the active \ningredient diffuses through the skin at a rate determined by \nthe concentration of the active substance and the diffusivity \nof the active substance. However, a variety of physical and \nchemical processes at the skin/patch boundary affect the \ndelivery  rate  and  may eventually  inhibit  drug  delivery \naltogether. \n\nThe original performance target for controlled drug deliv \nery is to achieve a Zero-order release rate of the drug, so that \na constant efficacious drug concentration is  maintained in \nthe blood plasma.  However, more than two decades of \nresearch in chronobiology and chronopharmacology have \ndemonstrated the importance of biological rhythms to the \ndosing of medications as well as determine the influence of \na patient's circadian or other biological rhythms on drug \nefficacy and efficiency. This research reveals that certain \ndisease symptoms follow a daily pattern, with peak Symp \ntoms at certain times of the day. It has been widely acknowl \nedged that hormones, neurotransmitters and other intra-body \ncompounds are released in different amounts at different \ntimes of the day pursuant to daily patterns. \n\nThe new approach stems from a growing body of research \nthat demonstrates that certain diseases tend to get worse at \ncertain times of the day. Also, certain disease symptoms \nhave peak periods when cravings are at their highest. By \nsynchronizing  medications  with a patient\u2019s  body clock, \nand/or addiction cycles, many physicians believe that the \ndrugs will work more effectively and with fewer side effects. \nIn some cases, the improvements have been so pronounced \nthat doctors have been able to reduce dosages. Circadian \nphysiologic processes have been found to alter drug absorp \ntion, distribution,  metabolism, and excretion. As a result, \ndrug doses need to be adjusted to meet the differing needs of \ntarget organs or tissues at various times of the day (see, L. \nLamberg, American Pharmacy, N831 (11): 20\u201323 (1991)). \nThe continued interest in chronopharmacology shows the \never-increasing need to develop technologies to control the \ntemporal profile in drug delivery. Research findings Suggest \nthat the onset and severity of many diseases are cyclic in \nnature, or follow circadian patterns. Addiction symptoms \nalso show cyclical nature. For example, cigarette Smokers \nexperience peak nicotine cravings upon waking, but nicotine \nis  a stimulant, so there is  a clear advantage to have an \nautomated drug delivery system that can be programmed to \nnot release nicotine during the sleep cycle, but to release \nnicotine prior to  waking, because this  would effectively \ncombat peak morning nicotine cravings while removing the \nadverse side effect of sleep cycle nicotine disturbances. Drug \ntolerance adds to the need for modulation of drug dosing \nprofiles. Additionally, skin irritation and sensitization caused \nby medications may require intervals during which no drug \nis administered. For example, fentanyl when administered \ncontinuously without rest periods can cause severe skin \nirritation, so there is a clear advantage of allowing the skin \na \u201crest period  when no fentanyl is delivered in order to \ndecrease adverse skin irritation and give the skin a chance to \nrecover. Therefore, this improved form of drug delivery will \nbe very  important to  people who need medicine easily, \npainlessly and automatically delivered to their bodies in \ntimed increments (see Smolensk, M. H. & Lamberg, L. \nBody Clock Guide to  Better  Health.  How to  Use Your \nBody\u2019s Natural Clock to Fight Illness and Achieve Maxi \nmum Health, Henry Holt & Company, New York (2001) and \nGrimes, J. et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther 285 (2): 457-463 \n(1998)). \n\n\fUS RE46,217 E \n\n5 \nActive transdermal delivery systems have been developed \nto help regulate the delivery rate by providing mechanisms \nto improve drug delivery over time by \u201cpumping  the active \ningredient.  One such system, (U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,370.635), \ndescribes a system for delivering a medicament and dis \npensing it to an organism for a relatively long period of time, \nfor example at least a few days. The device can be adapted \nfor positioning on the Surface of the skin of a human or \npossibly an animal body in order to apply a medicament \nthereto from the outer side thereof. Conventional transder \nmal systems circumvent the disadvantages of the adsorption \nthrough the gastrointestinal tract, but they do not optimize or \ntailor  the  dosing regiment to  offset  peak symptoms.  In \naddition the constant transdermal delivery of a drug can lead \nto severe side effects, including debilitating sleep disorders \n(if the drug is a stimulant) and ever increasing tolerance \n(such as pain medications). \n\nA simple type of transdermal chronotherapy is a biphasic \nprofile, in which the drug concentration changes from a high \nto a low level (or vice versa) over time. Although the system \ncan be physically applied or removed to alter the drug level. \npatient compliance with this procedure may be difficult, \nparticularly during inconvenient hours. To generate a bipha \nsic  profile,  the delivery  system may utilize  an external \nregulator,  as  described  in  Fallon  et  al.  (U.S.  Pat.  No. \n5,352,456) which illustrates a device for drug administration \nthrough intact skin that provides an initial pulse in the flux \nof the drug through the skin followed by a substantially \nlower flux of drug through the skin. Additionally, Fallon et \nal. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,820,875) later describe a device for the \nadministration of a drug through an area of intact skin over \na period of time in which the flux of the drug through the \nskin varies temporally in a controlled manner; The device is \nsuch that the skin flux of the drug varies in a controlled \nmanner over the period of administration, typically from a \nhigh flux in the initial stage of administration to a lower flux \nin the later stage of administration. \n\nTransdermal temporally controlled drug delivery systems, \nproposed by Giannos  et  al.  (U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,068,853) \ncoupled pH oscillators with membrane diffusion in order to \ngenerate a periodic release of a drug or active ingredient \ntransdermally, without external power sources and/or elec \ntronic controllers. The intent was to address chronotherapy \nwith a pulsatile transdermal system. The strategy was based \non the observation that a drug may be rendered charged or \nuncharged  relative  to  its  pK  value.  Since  only  the \nuncharged form of a drug can permeate across lipophilic \nmembranes, including the skin, a periodic delivery profile \nmay be obtained by oscillating the pH of the drug solution \n(see Giannos,  S.  A.,  \u201cPulsatile  Delivery of Drugs and \nTopical Actives.\u201d in \u201cNovel Topical Actives and Delivery \nSystems: Cosmetics, Dermatologicals and Transdermals'. \nEdited by John. J. Wille, Jr.: Blackwell Publishing, Oxford \nUK (In press)). \n\nRecently, an orally administered drug for arthritis treat \nment has suggested a chronotherapeutic approach using a \ndelay release system. The delay is scheduled to release the \nactive ingredient at the beginning of an interleukin 6 cascade \nthat is believed to cause early morning stiffness in rheuma \ntoid arthritis patients. By attempting to synchronize the drug \ndelivery with a biological cycle it is believed that low doses \nmay be used to achieve desired results. However, this system \ndoes not overcome the limitations of delayed release sys \ntems described above. \n\nAlthough it  may possible to meet the requirements of \nchronopharmacology with pills, this requires an enormous \namount of discipline by the patient  to  comply with the \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n6 \ntreatment regiment, see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,214. \n379, which is  incorporated herein by reference. As illus \ntrated earlier, to achieve optimal results, many patients may \nneed to wake up during the night to take their medication. \nHence, what is needed is a non-invasive, reliable means of \ndelivering drugs compounds in precisely timed and mea \nSured doses-without the inconvenience and hazard of injec \ntion, yet with improved performance as compared to orally \ndelivered drugs. \n\nAddressing patient compliance (taking the proper dosages \nat the prescribed times) is another critical problem facing \ncaregivers and pharmaceutical firms alike. Studies show that \nonly about half of patients take medications at the times and \nin the dosages directed by their physician. It is reported that \neach year, 125,000 deaths and up to 20% of all hospital and \nnursing home admissions result from patient noncompli \nance. It  is estimated that non-compliance results in addi \ntional healthcare costs in excess of S100 billion per year in \nUnited States. These figures are even more pronounced for \nthe elderly. \n\nAn individual\u2019s failure to comply with a dosing regimen, \ne.g. failure to take one or more doses of a drug or taking too \nmany doses, will have an adverse impact upon the Success \nof the regimen. Individuals may fail to comply with their \ndrug dosing regimen for a number of reasons. For example, \ndrug dosing regimens, such as every 4 hours, e.g., 8, 12, 4, \n8, 12, and 4 and the like, involve a rigid dosing schedule that \nmay be incompatible with an individuals personal schedule. \nSuch a rigid dosing schedule when combined with normal \nhuman traits such as forgetfulness or denial of a medical \ncondition,  as  well  as  a busy life,  represent  Substantial \nobstacles  to  compliance  with  a  drug  dosing  regimen. \nAccordingly, Such rigid dosing regimens often result in the \nfailure by an individual to take one or more doses at the \nprescribed time. This has an adverse impact on the levels of \nthe therapeutic Substance at the active site and consequently \non the overall efficacy of the therapeutic substance. \n\nHence,  a  need  exists  for  systems  and  methods  that \nincrease patient compliance for administration of a variety \nof drugs.  Also,  there  remains  a  need for an improved \npatch-based (or membrane-based) delivery system for an \nactive substance that is able to administrate the delivery of \na chemical Substance to a Subject over a period of time in a \ncontrollable way. It  is a preferable for such a system or \ndevice to administrate the delivery of a chemical substance \nin a pulsatile and Scheduled manner, pursuant to  a pre \nprogrammed  dosage  delivery  regimen,  meaning dosage \nsizes and times can be automatically varied according to \nSuch pre-programming. \n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\nEmbodiments of the present invention provide a patch/ \ndrug reservoir-based transdermal delivery device to admin \nistrate the delivery of an effective substance to a patch or \nother drug reservoir adjacent to the membrane or in close \nproximity to the skin for transdermal absorption that absorbs \nor is filled with the substance (the administration reservoir) \nover a period of time or from time to time in a controllable \nand/or automated and programmable way.  Significantly, \nthese transdermal delivery devices include a reusable, active \nportion that includes a control and display unit and an active \ndispensing mechanism, e.g., a micropump that is in some \nembodiments a specially  configured peristaltic  pump, a \npressurized reservoir, or other actuator. Further, the trans \ndermal delivery devices include a detachable and disposable \npassive portion that includes a drug reservoir that is sepa \n\n\fUS RE46,217 E \n\n7 \nrated from the administration reservoir and holds the drug \nuntil the micropump or other actuator places the drug into \nthe administration reservoir for transdermal absorption and \na coupling mechanism/assembly for mating with the active \ndispensing  mechanism, e.g.,  when the active dispensing \nmechanism is a peristaltic pump the coupling mechanism \nmay include one or more elongate feed chambers (e.g., \nflexible tubes) that are connected to the drug reservoir and, \nin many cases, to the administration reservoir adjacent the \nmembrane or skin or other material in contact with the skin. \nThe coupling mechanism may be defined in part by the outer \nSurfaces of a housing for the passive portion, and these \nSurfaces may include grooves or guides for receiving and \nSupporting the active dispensing mechanism. In some cases, \nthe outer Surfaces of the housing define an arcuate surface \nupon which the feed chamber or tube is disposed such that \nthe shoes or other portions of the peristaltic  pump can \ncompress the tube to  move liquid  from the dispensing \nreservoir  to  the  administration  reservoir  near the  semi \npermeable membrane or patch. \n\nIn  addition,  in  the  context  of automated transdermal \npulsatile drug delivery, starting dosing or bringing the active \ncompound into contact with the skin may be only one part \nof the necessary methodology. The other part of the meth \nodology may be to stop dosing or to stop permeation of the \nactive compound through the skin. Stopping dosing auto \nmatically is extremely useful in certain situations to start and \nstop dosing so as to achieve programmed pulsatile drug \ndelivery. The present invention not only has initial dosing or \ndelivering methodologies, but also methodologies to stop \ndosing or permeation so as to deliver and stop delivering \ncompounds to the body in a controlled and/or automated \nand/or programmable manner. \n\nMore specifically,  in  certain  embodiments  where the \nstop-page of permeation or dosing is desired, the active drug \nformulation or solvent is removed from the administration \nreservoir to stop dosing and/or decrease or end drug perme \nation through the skin. In this embodiment, a drug and/or \nSolvent removal means is introduced (solvent/drug removal \nmeans). In this situation, either the above mentioned micro \npump or actuator (which may move gas or air) or a second \nmicropump or actuator (which may move gas or air) will act \nto  remove, and/or flush  the active  drug formulation  or \nresidual drug formulation/and or solvent from the adminis \ntration reservoir into either into a waste reservoir or other \narea for evaporation or other removal. The first or second \nmicropump or actuator, as applicable, may flush the admin \nistration reservoir with air, gas, inactive solution and/or a \ncombination of these. \n\nIt is important to note that such an administration reser \nvoir acts as the administration depot for the transdermal \nabsorption and has a side (or a series of holes or openings or \notherwise) that allows the drug formulation to come into \ncontact with the skin for transdermal absorption, either by \npassing through a membrane in contact with the skin or \notherwise to reach the skin for transdermal absorption. Such \nadministration reservoir may take many forms, such as a \nSubstrate including a plurality of micro-passageways for the \ndrug formulation; a Substrate made up of micro-structured \nand/or micro-fabricated reservoirs; a substrate with a series \nof miniaturized or micro-structured reservoirs, a substrate \nincluding a plurality of ducts, culverts, and/or canals that \nmay take any size, shape, or configuration and which may be \nmicro-fabricated through any number of techniques includ \ning etching. This administration reservoir in whatever form \nit may take may be filled using a micro-pump or other type \nof actuator to allow for the transdermal absorption. The \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n8 \nreservoir may then be flushed or emptied, so as to stop or \nslow drug delivery by removing the active drug from a \nposition where it can access the skin for transdermal absorp \ntion. Aheating element may also be present whether directly \nformed in the substrate forming the administration reservoir \nor as a separate component of the drug reservoir either at the \ntop, bottom, or side of the drug reservoir.  This heating \nelement serves  to  increase  the  temperature  of the  skin \nSurface which increases the permeation of the active com \npound through the skin. This heating element aids in the \nmovement of liquids through the passageways, if applicable, \nincluding the administration reservoir. The heating element \nmay also aid in the evaporation of the drug formulation \nwhere evaporation is a desired method to dry the adminis \ntration area to  stop dosing by causing evaporation. This \nheating element may be programmed to automatically heat \nthe skin at precise preprogrammed times for precise timing \nof permeation enhancement and/or precise timing of stop \nping of dosing by inducing evaporation. The heating element \nmay be configured with a plurality of flow paths for vapor \nor evaporated portions of the liquid (Such as solvent vapor) \nthat facilitates relatively uniform or at least well distributed \nflow away from the reservoir. \n\nA further embodiment that requires the stopping of dosing \ninduces evaporation of the drug formulation or more spe \ncifically, the solvent, from the administration reservoir so as \nto dry the administration reservoir which will result in the \nstopping  of dosing.  A dry  skin/administration  reservoir \ninterface is not conducive to transdermal permeation. In this \nembodiment, the administration reservoir has vents or other \naccesses either to the environment for evaporation or imme \ndiate access by being in close proximity to a chamber(s) \ncontaining  a desiccant.  This  desiccant  chamber acts  to \ninduce evaporation and captures the solvent vapors to dry \nthe  interface  and stop  dosing.  In  this  embodiment, the \nheating element, which may be programmed to heat at a \ncertain time, heats the administration reservoir and/or skin \nand/or the whole device which increases significantly evapo \nration and speeds up the process which in turn stops dosing \nquickly. As an alternative to heat, a gas or air cartridge can \nbe present to  automatically, pursuant to  a programmed \nschedule, blow air or gas onto the administration area to \nrapidly dry the administration reservoir and stop dosing. \n\nThe inventive system or device allows for pulsatile trans \ndermal drug delivery, and the administration of differing \nsized dosages at different times of the day automatically, \npursuant to a pre-programmed dosage profile (e.g., a pro \ngram Stored in memory accessed by the control unit). This \nsystem or device can be most advantageous when the pre-set \nor programmed drug delivery profile corresponds to desired \npeaks and troughs in disease symptoms based on chronobi \nology and a person's circadian rhythms. This system or \ndevice can also be highly advantageous in addiction man \nagement when programmed to coincide with a person's peak \naddiction cravings. This system or device can also be highly \nadvantageous when patient compliance with a particular \ndelivery regimen is a desired effect so that a person, whether \nforgetful,  elderly,  children,  mentally impaired desires to \nensure correct drug delivery compliance. This device can \nalso be highly advantageous when a person or physician a \ndoctor wants to have a drug administered in differing dos \nages while asleep automatically without the need to wake \nup, of if the drug being used is a stimulant and the person \ndoes not want any drug released at night thereby causing \nsleep disturbances, but does want the device to administer \n\n\fUS RE46,217 E \n\n9 \ndrug shortly before waking so that therapeutically effective \nblood plasma concentrations of the drug are present upon \nWaking. \n\nAccording to some embodiments of the present invention, \nthe device comprises a control and display unit, a dispensing \nmechanism, e.g.,  a pump, pressurized reservoir or other \nactuator, a drug reservoir, an administration element, and/or \na solvent/drug removal means (e.g., flushing the adminis \ntration reservoir or using a desiccant or evaporative means \nSuch as heat or air/gas blowing to dry the administration \nreservoir), and/or a vapor removal element, when appli \ncable,  to  the  embodiment a  waste  reservoir,  and/or an \nadditional  micropump or  actuator.  Embodiments  of the \ninvention may include one or more of the following features. \nThe pump may be a peristaltic pump that includes a micro \nmotor, a roller, a mounting plate, a tubing, and a housing. As \ndiscussed above, the peristaltic pump is separated into two \nparts; the first part comprises the motor on the mounting \nplate and the roller (e.g., provided in the reusable portion of \nthe device) and the second part includes the tubing and the \nhousing (e.g.,  provided in the detachable and disposable \npassive portion of the device). The micromotor and the roller \nare mounted in the device with the control unit. The speed \nof the micromotor is controlled by the control unit, so that \nthe turning speed of the roller is controlled which, in turn, \ncontrols the flow rate from the dispensing reservoir to the \nadministration reservoir. The tubing and the housing are \ndetachable from the device. \n\nEmbodiments of the invention may include one or more \nof the following features. The tubing and the housing of the \nperistaltic pump and the dispensing or drug reservoir are \ncombined together, resulting in one, interconnected dispos \nable and replaceable dosing element. In other words, this \ndisposable dosing element (or detachable and disposable \npassive portion) is a replaceable dosing capsule which can \nbe used for one or multiple dosings. This disposable dosing \ncapsule can  be 'Snapped  into  place prior to  Substance \nadministration by the patient or other health worker, and, \nafter the drug reservoir is exhausted, the disposable dosing \nelement is \u201cpopped  out to be disposed, and a fresh dispos \nable dosing element is then \u201csnapped  back into the device. \nThe tubing is provided inside the body of the capsule in \nSome embodiments. One end of the tubing is connected to \nthe drug or dispensing reservoir while the other end of the \ntube is a fluidic adapter or distributor near the administration \nreservoir or area near the patch or membrane. In certain \nembodiments, the waste reservoir, desiccant chamber cap \nturing vapors evaporated from the drug/solvent, tubing and \nanalogous components of the second micro pump or actuator \nas the first pump mentioned above, a gas/air cartridge and \nthe administration reservoir may also be part of this Snapped \non or Snapped off portion or may be disposable pursuant to \nanother means. Further, embodiments of the invention may \ninclude one or more of the following features. The dispos \nable dose capsule, the administration element, and a drug/ \nSolvent removal element are connected and packed together \nas a disposable package, whenever the dosage is needed to \napplied to skin, the whole disposable package is  changed \nand replaced into the device. \n\nMore particularly, an apparatus is provided for selectively \ndelivering a liquid,  powder, or temporarily  free-flowing \nSolution (e.g., a drug formulation or the like). The apparatus \nincludes an active assembly with a controller and a power \nSource (e.g., a battery). The apparatus further includes a \npassive assembly configured for mechanically coupling and \ndecoupling with the active assembly. The passive assembly \nincludes a drug reservoir containing the drug formulation to \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n10 \nbe delivered. The apparatus further includes a micropump or \nother actuator that acts as the dispensing mechanism with an \nactive portion in the active assembly that provides a motive \nforce to draw or otherwise move the drug formulation from \nthe drug reservoir onto or into the administration reservoir. \nThe micropump or other actuator (or dispensing mechanism) \nincludes a passive portion provided in the detachable passive \nassembly so as to be proximate to the active portion of the \nmicropumpfactuator. The passive portion defines a feed or \ndelivery chamber through which the drug formulation flows \nfrom the drug reservoir when the motive force is applied to \nthe passive portion. In some embodiments, the micropump \nor other actuator includes a peristaltic pump with the active \nportion being made up of  a motor powered by the power \nsource and operated by the controller to control the motor \nspeed and its  time of operation;  a  roller  with  rotatably \nmounted shoes; a shaft contacting the roller and driven by \nthe motor; and a mounting plate Supporting the motor. The \npassive portion, in turn, includes a housing with a guide slot \nor recessed surface for receiving the mounting plate and \nroller so as to position one or more of the shoes in contact \nwith an outer surface of the feed chamber, which in some \nembodiments is a length of compressible tubing. The guide \nslot in these cases may include a curved surface and the \ntubing is positioned between the roller/shoes and the curved \nSurface Such that the motive force includes using the shoes \nto sequentially compress the tubing. \n\nThe passive assembly may further include an administra \ntion assembly including an administration reservoir con \nnected to the tubing to receive the drug formulation and a \nmembrane adjacent the administration reservoir that is per \nmeable to  an active or effective  substance in  the  drug \nformulation but not or less permeable to a solvent portion of \nthe liquid. In certain embodiments, an absorbent sheet (e.g., \nblotting paper or the like) may be provided in the adminis \ntration reservoir so as to distribute the received liquid in a \nrelatively uniform manner over the surface of the membrane. \nIn other embodiments, instead of an absorbent sheet, the \nadministration reservoir may be or include a rigid or flexible, \npermanent or disposable Substrate with a plurality of ducts, \nconduits or culverts that contain internal passageways for \nmovement of the drug formulation and have either a series \nof openings or a single opening mounted on the membrane \nor skin or otherwise adjacent to the membrane or skin to \nallow the drug formulation to  be absorbed or otherwise \ntransferred  or to  move from  the  substrate  ducts  to  the \nmembrane or skin for transdermal absorption. In this man \nner, the ducts, conduits, or culverts or in this Substrate can \nbe filled  by the micropump or other actuator with  drug \nformulation originating in the drug reservoir. Then, these \nducts, conduit, or culverts can be flushed either by the first \nmicropump actuator or a second micropump or other actua \ntor into a waste reservoir or flushed into an area for evapo \nration to begin and stop dosing in an accurate fashion. Yet \nfurther, a heat element may be provided in the administration \nassembly  near the  administration  reservoir  to  raise  the \ntemperature 3 to 10 degrees Celsius over a dermal tempera \nture to enhance transdermal permeation and/or diffusion \nand/or movement of the drug formulation through the Sub \nstrate and in some cases to increase evaporation when it is \ndesired to dry the reservoir (or absorbent sheet). In the latter \ninstance, the heating element may be configured with a \nplurality of flow paths for vapor or evaporated portions of \nthe liquid (such as solvent vapor) that facilitates relatively \nuniform or at least well distributed flow away from the \nreservoir. \n\n\fUS RE46,217 E \n\n11 \nAdditional advantages and novel features of this invention \nshall be set forth in part in the description that follows, and \nin part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon \nexamination of the following specification or may be learned \nby the practice of the invention. The advantages of the \ninvention may be realized and attained by means of the \ninstrumentalities, combinations, compositions, and methods \nparticularly pointed out in the appended claims. \n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n\n10 \n\nFIG. 1 is a perspective view of an exemplary portable \ntransdermal drug delivery device or assembly of the present \ninvention; \n\nFIG. 2 is a block diagram of the drug delivery device of \nFIG. 1 showing in block form representative components of \na portable device for transdermal drug delivery: \n\nFIG. 3 is perspective view showing some of the compo \nnents of the active and passive portions of a portable drug \ndelivery device in a disassembled arrangement (e.g., prior to \nattachment of a dosing element with its drug reservoir and \nreceiving slot or channel and tube? delivery channel to a \nreusable active element or portion (e.g., active portions of a \nperistaltic pump)); \n\nFIG. 4 is a cross sectional view of the assembled peri \nstaltic pump of FIG. 3 showing mating or coupling of the \nactive and passive portions  (or reusable and disposable \nportions) of a portable drug delivery device; \n\nFIGS.5A, 5B, and 5C are perspective and schematic side \nviews of an embodiment of a dose capsule with a drug \nreservoir and a housing for a peristaltic pump; \n\nFIG. 6 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a delivery or \nadministration element with an administration reservoir and \na solvent removal system Such as may be attached to the \ndrug delivery chamber or tube from the passive portion of a \ndispensing mechanism Such as those shown in the devices of \nFIGS. 3-5C, whereby the entire administration assembly \nmay be attached, used for dosing for a period of time, and \ndetached and disposed of after dosing is complete (and later \nreplaced when appropriate with a new assembly); \n\nFIG. 7 is a perspective view of an assembled administra \ntion assembly made up of a delivery element and a dose \ncapsule or element; \n\nFIG. 8 is cross-sectional view similar to that of FIG. 6 \nshowing an alternative embodiment of a delivery or admin \nistration element adapted for Solvent removal via air or gas \nflow through the administration reservoir; \n\nFIG. 9 is a cross-sectional view similar to that of FIGS. 6 \nand 8 showing another alternative embodiment of a delivery \nor administration element adapted for Solvent removal and \nenhanced drug delivery by providing a heating or tempera \nture control element proximate to the drug delivery mem \nbrane; \n\nFIG. 10 is a block diagram showing components of a \ncontrol and display unit for one embodiment of drug deliv \nery device of the invention; \n\nFIG. 11 is a block diagram similar to FIG. 2 showing \nanother embodiment of a drug delivery system or device of \nthe invention useful for multiple drug delivery: \n\nFIG. 12 is a block diagram similar to FIGS. 2 and 11 \nshowing yet another embodiment of a drug deliver device of \nthe invention that is useful for concurrent or sequential drug \ndelivery: \n\nFIG. 13 is a simplified view of a drug delivery surface of \na patch or membrane that is divided to provide separate \ndelivery surfaces or areas as may be useful with the device \nof FIG. 12; \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n12 \nFIG. 14 is a perspective view of one embodiment of a \nperistaltic micropump of the invention, such as may be used \nas part of dispensing mechanism in the devices of FIGS. \n1-13; \n\nFIG. 15 is an exploded perspective view of the pump of \n\n5 \n\nFIG. 14; \n\nFIG.  16  is  an enlarged  view of the  roller and shoe \n\nassembly of the motor shown in FIGS. 14 and 15; \n\nFIG. 17 is a detailed view of a tubing module showing the \narcuate channel for receiving the tube and facilitating com \npression by the roller assembly: \n\nFIG. 18 is a cross sectional view of the tubing module of \n\nFIG. 17; and \n\n15 \n\nFIG. 19 is a sectional/block view of a delivery device with \na waste reservoir for storing removed solvent/drug from an \nadministration reservoir to control dosing. \n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE \nPREFERRED EMBODIMENTS \n\nIn the drawings, like reference numerals indicate like \nfeatures, and a reference numeral appearing in more than \none figure refers to the same element. The drawings and the \nfollowing detailed descriptions show specific embodiments \nof the invention with numerous specific details including \nmaterials, dimensions, and products being provided to facili \ntate explanation and understanding of the invention. How \never, it  will be obvious to one skilled in the art that the \npresent invention may be practiced without these specific \ndetails and these broader embodiments of the invention are \nconsidered within the breadth of the following claims. \n\nThe present invention is generally directed to a portable \ndrug delivery device that can controllably deliver a particu \nlar dose accurately and in a timed manner. The devices of the \ninvention are typically configured with a reusable portion \nand a disposable portion. The reusable portion typically \nincludes the display  and control  components such as  a \nmicroprocessor, memory, interfaces, and power source and \nalso includes the active portion of a dispensing mechanism \n(e.g., active portion of a micropump). The disposable por \ntion can be selectively coupled or attached to the reusable \nportion and includes the passive portion of the dispensing \nmechanism (e.g., a micropump housing and feed or delivery \nchamber/tubing) as well as the drug or dispensing reservoir \nand also the administration assembly that may include an \nadministration reservoir, a diffusion membrane, and a sol \nvent removal element. In this manner, the present invention \naddresses problems with a membrane having a decreasing \ndiffusivity that may be caused by saturation with solvent, the \ncontact Surface becoming dirty or clogged, or other factors. \nThe device also facilitates  the  reuse of more expensive \ncomponents such as the microprocessor, memory compo \nnents, a liquid crystal display (LCD) or other display, and \nactive pump portions. These and other unique features of the \ninvention will become apparent in the following description. \nFIG. 1 illustrates  one embodiment of a portable drug \ndelivery device or assembly 1 of the present invention. The \ndevice 1 is shown to generally take the form of a wrist watch \nfor easy attachment to a patients arm or wrist to place an \nadministration element and more specifically a diffusion \nmembrane for transdermal delivery (or,  in Some cases, a \nneedle for Subcutaneous delivery), e.g., an administration \nassembly that can be removed from the reusable portion of \nthe device 1 shown in FIG. 1 is provided on the underside \nor reverse side of the device 1.  The device 1 includes a \ndisplay 90 to allow a patient or user of the device 1 to obtain \na status of a dosing regimen, e.g., to know whether the \n\n\fUS RE46,217 E \n\n13 \ndevice 1 actively dosing, when a next dose may be admin \nistered, how many doses remain for the device based on the \nparticular disposable dosing element, or the like. An input \narea or keyboard/keypad 93 is provided to allow the user to \nalter the display 90 and otherwise interact with the device 1. \nFIG. 2 illustrates in block form the components of the \ndevice 1 in one embodiment of the invention. The portable \ndevice  1  as  shown is  configured  for transdermal  drug \ndelivery and includes a control and display unit 7, a dis \npensing mechanism 2, a drug reservoir 3, an administration \nelement 5, a solvent removal element 4, and a battery 6. A \nliquid  is  typically  provided in  the  drug reservoir 3  for \ndispensing via feed chamber or delivery tube 13. The liquid \nincludes a Sufficient or predetermined amount of one or more \nactive substances dissolved or dispersed at an appropriate \nconcentration in a formulation which contains a solvent (or \nmore volatile liquid) or a mixture of solvent along with the \nactive Substances. For example, the Solvent may include one \nor more agents such as alcohols, oils,  water,  methylene \nchloride, ethanol or the like. If appropriate, other excipients \nmay be provided in the reservoir 3 such as tissue permeation \npromoter (enhancers),  thickening  Substances,  solubizers, \nbuffers,  chemical  stabilizers,  preservatives,  moisturizers, \nhumectants, emulsifiers, thinners, Surface-active agents, fra \ngrances, or the like. Examples of active Substances include, \nbut are not limited, to nicotine, Steroid hormones, analgesics, \nantioxidants,  vitamins, CNS drugs, cardiovascular drugs, \nanti-asthmatics, antibiotics, anti-cancer drugs, and the like \nand the invention is intended to cover any drug or other \nsubstance for which it is desirable to provide to a patient or \nother body (animal or human) in a time and dose controlled \n\na. \nThe control and display unit 7 can be implemented, for \nexample, by a microprocessor 91 with a LCD or other \ndisplay 90 and a drive circuit  and/or interface 92. The \nmicroprocessor 91 is programmed (with Software. Such as a \ndosing regimen routine or the like, in memory for example) \nas a programmable timer to send a control signal to the \ndispensing mechanism 2 through the drive circuit 92 at \nmultiple timing points.  Battery 6 provides power to  the \ndevice 1. In a specific embodiment, the dispensing mecha \nnism 2 is a two-part peristaltic micropump (e.g., a peristaltic \npump with an active portion that is provided with reusable \nportion of device 1 and a passive portion that is provided \nwith detachable and disposable portion 40) that delivers a \ndrug formulation from the drug reservoir 3 to the adminis \ntration element 5 at a certain flow rate and a certain duration \nthat are defined by the microprocessor 91 of the control and \ndisplay unit 7. \n\nIn some embodiments, the drug reservoir 3 is in form of \na collapsible  balloon  that  contains  drug formulation. A \nflexible and collapsible reservoir 3 is preferable in the device \n1 to avoid back pressures that may resist flow from the \nreservoir 3 if a more rigid-walled reservoir were utilized. \nThe walls  of the  reservoir 3 are also  preferably  resist \npermeation, i.e., are non-permeable or relatively imperme \nable, of the solvent/drug mixture or formulation and in this \nregard, the walls may be formed of TeflonTM, a high molecu \nlar membrane, or other similar material. \n\nThe administration element 5 is typically provided in the \ndisposable, detachable portion or unit 40 to allow it to be \nperiodically replaced with a new element 5. This is useful for \nproviding a new membrane to achieve a known diffusion \nrate and to provide a new administration reservoir (and any \nwicking material or the like provided in Such an adminis \ntration reservoir as discussed below). As shown, the admin \nistration element 5 includes an administration reservoir 34 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n14 \nand a diffusion membrane 35 (e.g., a membrane that allows \na particular diffusion  rate  for the drug in  the  liquid  or \nmixture in the drug reservoir 3 but is impermeable or much \nless permeable to the solvent). \n\nAs will be discussed in detail, one aspect of the invention \nis the inclusion of material. Such as blotting paper or sheet, \nin the reservoir 34 to uniformly distribute the formulation to \nthe diffusion membrane both in Volume (e.g., the liquid is \nrelatively equally provided over the upper surface of the \nmembrane rather than much more at the outlet of the feed or \ndelivery chamber/tube 13) and at a relatively uniform rate. \nFor example, in one embodiment, the administration ele \nment 5 includes an absorption sheet (e.g., blotting paper or \nthe like to \u201cwick\u2019 the liquid from chamber or tube 13 over \nthe administration reservoir 34) and a membrane which are \nlaminated tightly together at their interface and typically to \nthe edges of the frame of the element 5. The particular \nmembrane used for membrane 35 is not limiting and may \ninclude, but is not limited to a membrane of microporous \npolyethylene, polyethylene co-vinyl acetate (EVA copoly \nmer, polyurethane, and the like.  A device-skin interface \ncoupling  media and/or control  membrane or layer  may \nfurther be provided of ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellu \nlose, poly(ethylene co-vinyl acetate), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, \npoly(ethylene oxide), poly(ethylene vinyl alcohol) and the \nlike. \n\nTubing or a feed chamber 13 is provided in the detachable \nand disposable unit 40 to connect the drug reservoir 3 to the \nadministration element 5 through passive portion of the \ndispensing mechanism 2. When the device 1 is positioned \nfor use, the membrane 35 is preferably in tight contact with \nthe skin using an adhesive and/or wristband. The device 1 \nthen operates to provide even diffusion of the drug over the \ndrug absorption surface area of the membrane 35. A solvent \nremoval element 4 is typically provided in the device 1 (e.g., \nin the reusable portion as shown or in the disposable portion \nin Some cases) to control dosing by removing the solvent or \nfluid mixture. The element 4 may include desiccant, absor \nbent material, or other material to absorb evaporating Sol \nvent, with the element 4 being connected to the administra \ntion element Such as by one or more tubes (not shown). A \nconnection is shown between the interface or drive circuit 92 \nof control  unit  7,  and this  may be used to  sense the \nconcentration of a drug in the administration reservoir 34 \nand to control operation of the solvent removal element \n(e.g.,  in embodiments where active components are pro \nvided to  further solvent removal as discussed below). In \nSome embodiments, these connections may also be used to \nallow the control 7 to receive temperature signals from a \nsensor contacting or near the reservoir 34 and/or membrane \n35. \n\nIn some preferred embodiments, the dispensing mecha \nnism 2 is a micropump, e.g., positive displacement micro \npump. For example, the pump 2 may be a two part piezo \nelectric micropump in which the drive or active portion is \nprovided in the reusable portion of the device 1 and the \nchamber 13 is provided in the disposable portion 40. In one \npreferred embodiment, the micropump is  configured as a \ntwo-part peristaltic pump that can be provided as an active \npart and a passive part to allow the active part to be provided \nin the reusable portion of device 1 and the passive parts \nincluding the tube or feed chamber 13 and portions of the \npump housing (including the compression Surface) provided \nin the detachable and disposable portion 40. \n\nAccording to  one representative embodiment, FIG.  3 \nshows a disassembled peristaltic pump for use as dispensing \nmechanism 2. The pump 2 has two parts or elements: an \n\n\fUS RE46,217 E \n\n15 \nactive part and a passive part. The active part is an assembly \nof a motor 17, a mounting plate 11, a roller 12 attached to \na shaft of motor 17, and shoes 15, which are rotatably \nmounted to roller 12 and are shown as four ball bearings (but \ntwo or more shoes 15 may be used and other configurations \nother than ball bearings may be used to practice the inven \ntion). The active part is preferably housed with the other \ncomponents of reusable portion of device 1  such as the \nbattery 6 and control and display unit 7, such as with the \nplate 11 and drive components 12 and 15 being exposed with \nthe motor 17 being completely or partially inserted into the \nhousing wall (not shown). \n\nThe passive part of the dispensing mechanism 2 is, in \ncontrast, provided in the disposable portion 40 as shown in \nFIG. 1 and is designed or configured for coupling with the \nplate 11 and drive components 12, 15 of the active portion \nof the mechanism 2. The passive part is an assembly of a \npump housing 14 and a tubing or feed chamber 13. A \nreceiving slot or guide 16 is provided with an opening and \ninternal Surfaces (including an arched or arcuate compres \nsion surface 16A shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 on which the tube \n13  is  positioned  for compression by the  shoes  15) for \nreceiving the active portion, e.g., receiving and Supporting \nplate 11, rollers 12, and shoes 15 while allowing motor 17 \ncasing to slide through the outer wall of housing 14. \n\nThe motor 17 can be a stepping motor or a DC motor that \nis speed-controlled by a control unit (such as control 91 via \ninterface 92). The motor 17 is  mounted on the mounting \nplate 11 that is fixed in a device, which is the device 1 in the \nembodiments of this invention and the plate 11 and part of \nthe motor 17 may extend out from a housing (not shown) \nthat houses the non-disposable components (i.e., the com \nponents that are not part of unit 40 in FIG. 1). The roller 12 \nis mounted on the axis or drive shaft of the motor 17. On the \nroller 12, there are four ball bearings 15. In the housing 14. \nthere is  a slot  16 that accommodates the motor 17, the \nmounting plate  11,  and the roller  12. The tubing  13 is \ninserted through the housing 14 on which there are provided \ntwo holes. Tubing 13 passes through the holes. \n\nFIG. 3 shows a cross sectional view of the peristaltic \npump dispensing mechanism 2 in which the passive part is \nslid up so that it is positioned to where the bearings 15 on \nthe roller 12 press against the tubing 13 properly and when \nrotated periodically compress the tube 13 against the arched \nor curved surface 16A. The tubing 13 is flexible so that the \nbearings 15 on the roller 12 press the tubing 13 against an \narc 16A and move the fluid along through the tube 13. In this \nembodiment, the four bearings 15 on the roller 12 act as \nshoes to press on the tubing 13. Three to five or more shoes \n15 can be used. When assembled in a portable drug delivery \ndevice, the tubing 13 connects the drug reservoir 3 to the \nadministration element 5 in the application of the device 1 \nshown in FIG. 1. \n\nThe use of a peristaltic pump as the dispensing mecha \nnism 2 provides significant advantages for a drug delivery \ndevice according to the invention. These advantages include \nlow risk of drug formulation contamination as the drug only \ncontacts the tubing and not the drive components of the \npump 2 and this tube 13 is disposed of with the disposable \nunit. The use of a peristaltic pump 2 also provides simple \nand cost-effective operation, accuracy of dosing, low main \ntenance, self-priming, and gentle pumping action, as well as \nthe ability to pump liquid, mixed-phase and Viscous fluids, \nand the elimination of the need to clean or flush the pump or \ntubing of substance residue, to ensure sterility of the device \nover period of time. One of the chief advantages of the \nperistaltic pump 2 for the drug delivery device 1 is that the \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n16 \ndrug formulation from the drug reservoir 3 to the adminis \ntration element 5 does not contact any internal parts. Seals \nand valves are not needed as in other pumps. \n\nFIGS. 5A-5C show one preferred embodiment of a dose \ncapsule 20 with a drug reservoir 26 and a peristaltic pump \nhousing 16 (e.g.,  the passive portion  of the dispensing \nmechanism 2).  Inside  the  drug reservoir  26 there  is  a \ncollapsible balloon 29 with an inlet 25 and an outlet. The \ninlet 25 is connected to a fluidic fitting for drug formulation \npre-loading (e.g., filling of the balloon or flexible, collaps \nible reservoir 29). The outlet is or connected to internal \ntubing  24,  which  is  pulled  through  the  housing 16 to \ncompose a peristaltic pump 2 with tubing 13 (e.g., internal \ntubing connected to reservoir, tubing in contact with shoes \n15 and surface 16A, and external tubing that extends out \nfrom housing  14 to  connect with  an administration  or \ndelivery assembly or element (such as element 30 of FIG. 6). \nBy combining the peristaltic pump housing 16 with the \ndrug reservoir 26 (both of which are typically formed of a \nrigid plastic  or the like),  the dose capsule 20 can be a \ndisposable element separately or with the delivery element, \nas discussed below. When the drug formulation is replaced, \nthe tubing 13, 24 of the pump 2 is also simultaneously \nreplaced. The design of the present invention minimizes or \neliminates the need for cleaning the peristaltic pump of the \ndevice. Another main practical advantage of this design is to \navoid shelf-time problems of the device. If the peristaltic \npump is assembled with the housing and the tubing, the \nshoes on the roller will press against the tubing for a long \nperiod of the shelf time, which may result in tubing defor \nmation problems and affect the accuracy of the flow rate of \nthe peristaltic pump. If the drug reservoir and the peristaltic \npump are not assembled together as shown and described, it \nmay be inconvenient for a patient  to  change the  drug \nformulation because the disconnection and connection of the \ntubing with the drug reservoir, and priming the pump are not \nuser friendly and easy tasks. Our embodiment separates the \nperistaltic pump into two parts, the active and passive parts, \nin order to retain the expensive active part of the peristaltic \npump in the device and combine the passive part with the \ndrug reservoir. This approach of the two components mini \nmizes or eliminates the problems detailed above. \n\nFIG. 5C shows an embodiment of this invention with the \npassive portion of the dispensing mechanism 2 disassembled \nfrom the active part. The active part of the peristaltic pump, \ni.e., the motor 17, the mounting plate 11, and the roller 12, \nis retained in the device (e.g., device 1 of FIG. 1) and is not \ntypically disposable (e.g., is reusable). The passive part, i.e., \nthe peristaltic pump portions including the housing 14, the \nreceiving slot or guide 16, and the tubing 13 and 24, is \ncombined with the drug reservoir 26 with fill connection 25 \nto form the disposable dose capsule 20 which is replaceable \nas shown with line 19. The end of external tubing 13 is \nconnected to an administration element (Such as shown in \nFIG. 6) for drug delivery from the reservoir 26. \n\nFIG. 6 shows a cross sectional  view of one preferred \nembodiment of a delivery element 30 for connection to \ntubing or feed chamber 13 to receive the drug mixture 29A \nfrom a flexible drug reservoir liner 29. Such connection of \nthe element 30 and the dose capsule may be done by the \nuser/patient or more typically, are done for the patient (Such \nas by a dose Supplier or manufacturer) Such that the user/ \npatient can simply \u201csnap' offa used/depleted disposable unit \nor portion of a device and 'Snap' or connect a new unit \nincluding both a dosing capsule and the delivery element 30 \n\n\fUS RE46,217 E \n\n17 \n(with this connection acting to couple the passive and active \nportions of the dispensing mechanism such as two parts of \na pump). \n\nAs shown, the delivery element or assembly 30 includes \na housing 37, a tubing or fill line 31 with an optional conic \nor funnel-shaped end 36.  In  this  embodiment, a solvent \nremoval element 32 (such  as  element 4 of FIG.  1)  is \nprovided in the element 30 so as to support solvent removal \nto control or end dosing. For example, a desiccant filling 32 \nmay be provided in chambers of housing 37 as shown. A \nframe 33 defines an administration reservoir at one end of \nthe housing (e.g., distal to the connection line 31) that can \nbe filled with fluid 29A. To facilitate more uniform distri \nbution of the liquid 29A, an absorption sheet 34 such as \nblotting paper or other material that functions to absorb and \nwick or transport the liquid 29A from conical outlet 36 about \nthe area of the reservoir, is provided in the reservoir (or to \ndefine the administration reservoir by filling the reservoir \nchamber defined by frame 33). \n\nThe blotting paper or absorption sheet 34 acts to hold the \nliquid 29A to provide a more controllable diffusion rate for \nelement 30 and typically  the sheet 34 is  \u201csaturated  by \nselecting  a  volume of liquid  29A to  wet the  entire  or \nsubstantially the entire sheet 34. The element 30 further \nincludes a diffusion membrane 35 that typically abuts and \nmay even be laminated to absorption sheet 34. The housing \n37 with the frame 33 forms a chamber that is  a solvent \nremoving element 4 of FIG. 1, where the absorbent material \n32 Such as a desiccant filling is placed. The absorption sheet \n34 and the diffusion membrane 35 are laminated together in \nsome embodiments. The absorptions sheet 34 can be blotting \npaper, Sponge, porous plastics, porous rubber, cellulose, or \nother materials (e.g., material with similar liquid absorbency \nand/or wicking properties), with a thickness in the range or \n0.3 to 3 mm or more. \n\nDrug formulation 29A is  delivered by the dispensing \nmechanism 2 that is connected to the tubing or fill line 31. \nThe conic end 36 of the tubing 31 may be contacted to the \nabsorption film 34 or be spaced apart. The drug formulation \n29A dispensed through the tubing 31 is soaked up by the \nabsorption film or sheet 34. The diffusion membrane 35 is \npreferably,  but not necessarily, in  tight contact with the \nabsorption film 34 on one side and with a patient\u2019s skin on \nanother side (when in use), and provides an even diffusion \nof the drug over its surface area. The conic end 36 provides \na larger absorption area, which facilitates distribution of the \nliquid  29A and also  inhibits  accumulation  of the  drug \nformulation at the end of the tubing and capillary action that \ndraws the drug formulation back into the tubing 31 when the \ndispensing mechanism stops. \n\nThe solvent of the drug formulation evaporates continu \nously from the absorption film 34. Vapor is trapped by the \ndesiccant 32 in  the  solvent  removing element.  Solvent \nremoval serves the purpose of withdrawing depleted solvent \nfrom the absorption film 34 and the membrane 35, so that, \nafter repeated dispensing no freely moving liquid is formed. \nThe amount of drug delivered increases by increasing the \nvolume of dispensed formula. Furthermore, by withdrawal \nof solvent in-between dispensing events, drug concentration \nsteadily increases and reaches Saturation or possibly Super \nsaturation in the absorption film 34 and the membrane 35, \nthereby maximizing delivery rate. When dispensing of the \ndrug formulation  is  stopped the residual  solvent in  the \nabsorption film 34 and the membrane 35 is  removed by \nelement 32. The absorption film 34 and the membrane 35 are \ndried which stops drug delivery. \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n18 \nFIG. 7 shows a  combination  (e.g.,  a disposable and \ndetachable portion) 40 of the delivery element 30 with the \ndose capsule 20 shown in FIG. 6 and FIG. 4, respectively. \nThe disposable portion 40 may be an integral body of the \ndose capsule 20 and the delivery element 30 or may be two \nhousings that are mechanically connected or fastened. Tub \ning 13 connects the internal tubing 24 in the dose capsule 20 \nfor the peristaltic pump with tubing or fill  line 31 in the \ndelivery element 30. The combination 40 can be molded and \nassembled to be a package for one dose of a treatment or \nmultiple doses of a dosing regimen. Drug formulation can be \npre-loaded into the drug reservoir 26. The 13, 24 can also be \nembedded in the body of the combination of the delivery \nelement 30 and the dose capsule 20. Whenever the drug \nformulation is  replaced, the tubing, the desiccant, and the \nabsorption  and membrane are  all  replaced,  so  that  the \nproblems for the customer related to tubing disconnection \nand connection, desiccant replacement, and the absorption \nand membrane change are minimized or eliminated. Plug \nging the dose assembly or disposable portion 40 into the \ndevice 1 by connection of housing 14 with receiving groove \n16 with the active portions of a dispensing mechanism or \npump 2 as  discussed  above allows  customers  such  as \npatients and medical technicians to easily operate a portable \ndrug deliver device of the present invention. \n\nIn a further embodiment of a solvent removal element 4, \nFIG. 8 shows a cross sectional view of an embodiment 50 \nthat blows air or other gas onto an administration sheet 44 \n(or through an empty administration reservoir) to aid in the \nevaporation  of solvent.  The preferred  embodiment  50 \nincludes a housing 47, and a tubing adapter or fill line 41 \nwith a conic end 46. In the reusable portion, a gas source or \nblower is  provided (but not shown) that  may include a \npump/blower, a pressurized canister with a volume of pres \nSurized gas, or the like as well as controls and Valving as \nnecessary to provide selective flow of the gas. In the element \n50, it is desirable to control the flow of the gas. To this end, \na cellular element 53 (e.g., a porous channel element, a \nhoneycomb member, or the like) is positioned in the housing \n47 to cause the air or other gas to flow relatively evenly \nacross the absorption sheet 44 rather than simply in certain \nareas.  As shown,  the  air  distribution  manifold  further \nincludes an air inlet 51 and outlets 52 (with or without \none-way check valves). The element 50 further includes an \nadministration sheet 44, a diffusion  membrane 45, and a \nconduit 43 between the cellular element 53 and the admin \nistration sheet 44. The housing 47 with the cellular element \n53 forms a chamber 48 that creates a path for airflow away \nfrom the  sheet 44 through the element 53, through the \nchamber 48, and out of the element 47 via the outlets 52. \nThe airflow comes in from the inlet 51 at a volume, flow \nrate, and duration selected typically to dry (to a desired level \nor  substantially  completely)  the  sheet  44.  The airflow \nspreads  in  the conduit 43 and on the back side of the \nadministration  sheet 44,  then  flows through the cellular \nelement 53 and the outlet 52 to the outside of the element 50. \nThe solvent delivered onto the administration sheet 44 with \nthe drug formulation is carried away with the airflow. Once \nthe residual solvent in the administration film 44 and the \nmembrane 45 is removed, the administration sheet 44 and \nthe membrane 45 are dried which stops drug delivery. In this \nmanner, a pulse pattern  for drug delivery is  realized by \nprogramming the drug delivery time and duration, and the \nairflow time and duration. In other words, the delivery of a \ndrug or active substance can better be controlled not only by \nthe accurate providing of a drug formulation to the element \n50 but also the rapid and controlled removal of the formu \n\n\fUS RE46,217 E \n\n19 \nlation by drying of the sheet or reservoir 44. The flow rate \nand duration of the gas such as air may vary to practice the \ninvention and may be selected depending upon the particular \nsolvent utilized. \n\nFIG. 9 shows a cross sectional view of an embodiment of  5 \n\nan administration element 60 that can apply heat onto an \nadministration sheet 64 to enhance drug permeation of the \nskin and to also enhance evaporation (as discussed above \nwith reference to air/gas flow, which may be combined with \nheater  element  in  some  embodiments).  The  preferred \nembodiment 60 includes a housing 67, a tubing adapter with \na conic end 66, a heat element 61, vents 62, an administra \ntion sheet 64, a diffusion membrane 65, a temperature sensor \n69, and a conduit 63 between the heat element 61 and the \nadministration sheet 64 (or reservoir). The housing 67 above \nthe heat element 61 forms or defines a chamber 68 that \ncreates a path for solvent evaporation. The heat element 61 \ncan be turned on and off by programming and controlled by \na microprocessor Such as that provided in a typical control \nand display unit. \n\nIn some embodiments, a particular temperature is main \ntained at the administration area, Such as 2 to 10 degrees \nCelsius and preferably at  least about 4 degrees Celsius \nhigher than typically body temperature when the device 1 is \nbeing operated for drug delivery as Such a temperature range \nwill  significantly  increase  drug permeation  or diffusion \nthrough  the  membrane 65 and into  the  skin.  In  some \nembodiments, the drug formulation is applied on the admin \nistration sheet 64 and the heat element 61 is turned on and \nleft  on or cycled during drug delivery operations or as \nneeded to maintain a desired temperature or temperature \nrange. The temperature sensor 69 is provided (e.g., embed \nded) in the conduit 63 and operates to sense the temperature \non the administration sheet 64 and send a signal to micro \nprocessor 91 through the interface 92.  By this  feedback \ncontrol, the temperature on the administration sheet 64 can \nbe kept at 4 degrees Celsius (or a range about this or another \ndrug delivery set point) above the body temperature Such as \nproximate to  40 degrees Celsius.  After drug delivery  is \ncompleted, the heater element 61 may be operated to provide \nadditional heat, such as by raising the temperature to 5 to 10 \ndegrees Celsius or more above skin temperature, to hasten \nevaporation of the solvent from reservoir or absorbent sheet \n64. Once the residual solvent in the administration film 44 \nand the membrane 45 evaporate, e.g., in about 30 minutes \nfrom experimental results, and the administration sheet 44 \nand the membrane 45 are dried, the heat element 61 is turned \noff (with this control being determined by a moisture sensor \n(not shown) or by experiential knowledge for a particular \nreservoir/sheet, solvent, heater, and temperature combina \ntion  (e.g.,  a known operating time for drying based on \nresults). \n\nFIG. 10 shows an embodiment of the control and display \nunit 7 useful for realizing the functions of the one or all \nembodiments of this invention. The control and display unit \n7 is one or several electric circuit boards with the micro \nprocessor system 91, the display 90, the keyboard 93, and \nthe interface 92. The unit 7 may further include one or \nmemory devices 85 for storing dosing regimens or routines \nfor running by processor 91 to control the operation (dura \ntion and speed to control flow rate) of the dispensing unit 2. \nthe heater 61, and/or an air/gas source (not shown) to control \ndiffusion rates for a device incorporating unit 7. The inter \nface 92 includes an interface circuit 94, a drive circuit 95 for \nthe dispensing unit 2 in the all embodiments; a drive circuit \n96 for the heat element 61 and/or air/gas  supply, and a \ntemperature amplification  circuit 97 for the temperature \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n20 \nsensor(s)  69.  The control  signals  and the  measurement \nsignals are output from or input to the microprocessor 91 \nthrough the interface circuit 94. \n\nThe dosing regimen 86 may be used to provide the flow \nrate for the pump/driving mechanism 2 and also the timing \nof its  operation.  A typical  reservoir  may provide  drug \nvolumes that can be applied for multiple days (such as for 3 \nor more days), and controlled transdermal release of an \nactive material Such as a drug can be timed and dosages \nselected  to  better  match a body's  rhythms  to  enhance \nchronopharmacological efficacy. Specifically, the co-pend \ning and published U.S. patent application Ser. No. 1 1/162, \n525, entitled \u201cBiosynchronous Transdermal Drug Delivery' \nfiled  Sep.  13,  2005, which is  incorporated herein  in  its \nentirety by reference, describes the use of specific dosing \nregimens to select dosing (e.g., flow rates to the adminis \ntration element) and also the timing of Such dosages to \nenhance the effectiveness of the particular drug (e.g., treat \nheart attack and stroke in early morning hours, treat arthritis \nprior to a patient awakening, and the like). This references \nteaching is incorporated for use in configuring the dosing \nregiment 86 and otherwise for controlling operation of the \nprocessor 91 and other processors for operating the dispens \ning  mechanism 2  (its  flow  rate  and timing/duration  of \noperation) and solvent removal components. \n\nAnother embodiment of this  invention of a device for \ntransdermal drug delivery is shown in FIG. 11 as a device \n100 for multiple drug formulations. The device 100 includes \na control and display unit with a microprocessor system 101, \nan interface 102, a display 104, and a keyboard 103. Also, \nthe device 100 includes a battery 106; a dispensing mecha \nnism 109 (such as pumps 2 described above with an active \nand passive portion); drug reservoirs 111, 112, and 113; a \n3-way fluidic switch 110; a solvent removal element 105; \nand an administration element 107 (such as a reservoir with \na wicking filler or absorbent sheet) with a diffusion mem \nbrane 108. \n\nThe control and display unit may be similar as the unit 7 \nin device 1 of FIG. 1, except there is a control signal for the \n3-way fluidic  switch 110 to select one of the three drug \nformulations in the reservoir 111, 112, and 113 respectively. \nThe fluidic switch is like a 3-way fluidic valve for 3-to-1 \nfluidic selection. Under the microprocessor 101 control, one \nof the three drug formulations can be selected to apply to the \nadministration element 107 through the dispensing mecha \nnism 109. In this embodiment, three drug formulations are \npresented but the number of the drug formulation can be 2 \nor 4 or more and is not limiting of the invention. The device \n100 can be used to apply drugs or active Substances sequen \ntially with drying completed between dosing of each drug in \nreservoirs 111, 112, 113. Alternatively, two or more of the \ndrugs may be applied to the membrane 108 via the admin \nistration  element 107 and feed tube 115 by providing a \nvolume of each liquid to the element 107 sequentially but \nwith little or no gap between operation of mechanism 109 \n(e.g., apply drug in reservoir 111 and then immediately or \nafter only a short delay the drug from reservoirs 112 and/or \n113). \n\nThe dispensing mechanism 109 can be a peristaltic micro \npump (as discussed above) but can also be a diaphragm or \nother positive displacement micropump such as a piezoelec \ntric micropump. The solvent removal element 105 can be a \ndesiccant pack, a blowing-air element, or a heat element (or \na combination thereof), as described in the other embodi \nments. The administration element 107 and the diffusion \nmembrane 108 can be an absorption sheet laminated with a \ndiffusion  membrane. This embodiment shows dispensing \n\n\fUS RE46,217 E \n\n21 \nmultiple drug formulations separately and selectively by the \ncontrol of the microprocessor 101, which is programmed \naccording to a doctor's prescription. \n\nAnother preferred embodiment of this  invention  of a \ndevice for transdermal drug delivery is shown in FIG. 12 as \na  device  200  for  concurrent  delivery  of multiple  drug \nformulations (e.g., 2 or more). The device 200 includes a \ncontrol and display unit with a microprocessor System 201, \nan interface 202, a display 204, and a keyboard 203. The \ndevice 200 further includes a battery 206; a dispensing \nmechanism or pump 209; drug reservoirs 211 and 212; a \nsolvent removal element 205; and administration elements \n207 and 208 with a diffusion  membrane 210, which are \nseparated into two areas by wall or separator 216. The device \n200 is similar with the device 100 except that the device 200 \ncan dispense multiple drug formulations simultaneously. \n\nThe dispensing mechanism 209 is  a multiple channel \nliquid delivery device. Such as a multiple channel peristaltic \nmicropump. In this embodiment, two drug reservoirs 211 \nand 212 are connected to the dispensing mechanism 209, \nthen under the control of the dispensing mechanism 209, \napplied to the administration elements 207 and 208 via feed \ntubes or channels 213 and 214. Even though the two drug \nformulations  are  demonstrated  in  this  embodiment,  the \nnumber of the drug formulations can vary and is not limited \nto two as shown in FIG. 12. \n\nFIG.  13  shows an embodiment of the administration \nelement 215 with the two administration areas 207 and 208 \nand a divider 216. The drug formulations are delivered to the \nconic ends of feed tubes or channels 213 and 214 by the \ndispensing mechanism 209. The diffusion membrane 210 is \nproximate to and in some cases in tight contact with the \nadministration element 215 to provide an even diffusion of \nthe drugs over its Surface area. In this manner, two or more \ndiffusion areas 207,208 can be divided on the administration \nelement 215 to provide multiple drug formulations delivery \nsimultaneously. \n\nWhile only transdermal drug delivery embodiments are \nshown, many of the features of the invention are equally \napplicable to Subcutaneous drug delivery. For example, the \ninventors envision the use of the micropumps, such as the \ntwo part pumps and dosing capsules, to Subcutaneous drug \ndelivery in hospitals and other similar settings. In one Such \nembodiment, the device 1 of FIGS. 2 to 10 and devices 100 \nand 200 of FIGS. 11 to 13 may be modified by replacing the \nadministration  element and membrane with a needle or \ncoupling from the dispensing mechanism to an intravenous \nconnection. In these embodiments, the pump may be the \nperistaltic pump which would allow the dosing capsule to \nreadily be attached, detached, and replaced as described \nabove to  facilitate  dosing  with  differing  drugs  without \nrequiring disposable of the active portion of the pump and \nthe display unit. \n\nAs discussed above, the dispensing mechanism of the \ninvention may be a two-part (e.g., active and passive por \ntions) peristaltic pump. Such a pump may take a number of \nforms to practice the invention, but the following discussion \nwith reference to FIGS. 14-18 provides one useful embodi \nment of Such a peristaltic micropump. \n\nVarious types of micropumps have been developed for \ndelivering or dispensing a controlled flow of a liquid in a \nSmall, measurable (or known) quantity. In the field of drug \ndelivery, it is recognized that Supplying a drug in a correct \ntemporal pattern  is  an  important attribute  of any drug \ndelivery methodology. Controlled release drug delivery sys \ntems,  such  as  those  described  herein,  are  intended  to \nimprove the response to a drug and/or lessen side effects of \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n22 \nthat drug. This is also important in the field of chronophar \nmacology, where biological rhythms are an important aspect \nof clinical  pharmacology and are preferably  taken  into \naccount when controlling a drug delivery system (or select \ning a dosing regimen). \n\nThere has been an extensive amount of research into the \ndesign of various micropumps. Currently, most micropumps \nare driven by a piezoelectric element bonded to a flexible \nmembrane covering the  pump chamber.  Many research \ngroups have developed various micropumps such as pumps \nwith pumping pressures over 7 m of water and micropumps \nusing nozzles and/or diffuser components, which even at \nminiature length  scales  results  in  accurate flow  Volume \ncontrol and high reliability. Some of these micropumps are \nrelatively low cost, high performance silicon micropumps \nfor disposable drug delivery systems (such as the micro \npump described in Maillefer, D., et al., \u201cA High Performance \nSilicon Micropump for an Implantable Drug Delivery Sys \ntem.\u201d Technical Digest MEMS '99,  pp. 541-546,  1999, \nwhich is  incorporated herein by reference). Similarly, the \npiezoelectric diaphragm micropumps available from Star \nMicronics may be used in the dispensing mechanism of the \ninvention, and generally include a diaphragm bonded to a \npiezo-ceramic element that mechanically vibrates to induce \nchange of chamber Volume and, thus, conveys fluid or gas \nthrough the pump chamber (which, in  the embodiments \ndescribed above, would be in  the passive portion of the \ndispensing mechanism). \n\nHowever, it  should be noted that there may be some \ndrawbacks to  using piezoelectric  materials to achieve a \nmicropump (although they have been well developed where \na pump element is oscillated by the application of electrical \nimpulses  on piezoelectric  elements to  create  a pressure \ndifferential  in  a liquid).  First,  piezoelectric  elements are \nformed from brittle crystal materials that are difficult and \nexpensive to machine, particularly on Small scales. Second, \npiezoelectric materials generally are not suitable for con \ntacting liquids. Micropumps that exploit piezoelectric move \nment typically must be designed to insulate the piezoelectric \nmaterial from contact with liquid. Third, even though the \npower consumption of the piezoelectric micropump is typi \ncally low, electrical circuitry with a high Voltage Supply is \nnecessary  to  drive  and control  piezoelectric  movement, \nwhich requires a certain Voltage and current power Supply to \nwork.  For portable  devices  and devices  powered by  a \nbattery, this presents a challenge for using a piezoelectric \npump in the dispensing mechanism. \n\nIn contrast, peristaltic pumps are desirable for use in the \ndispensing mechanism as they use a flexible tube that is \ncompressed by a series of shoes on a roller to induce liquid \nflow.  Such pumps provide a positive  displacement and \nrequire little  or no maintenance. A continuous tube that \ncontains  the  fluid  to  be moved (such  as  in  a  cooling \nembodiment) or delivered sits between the shoes and a rigid \nwall (e.g., the curved Surface provided the housing of the \npassive portion of the dispensing mechanism). The shoes \npinch the tube against the wall as the roller is turned by an \nelectric  motor, which creates  a positive pressure on the \noutput side of the tube and a negative pressure on the input \nside. Peristaltic pumps are self-priming, and the only mate \nrial in contact with the solution or liquid is the tube. Thus, \na wide variety of fluid-compatible tube material can be \nselected to  meet the life  expectancy (e.g.,  the expected \nnumber of cycles and the like). There is a demand for a \nbattery-driven or a low-voltage-driven micropump that is \n\n\fUS RE46,217 E \n\n23 \nable to induce an amount of liquid flow. For life sciences, it \nis often preferable that the micropump be relatively inex \npensive and disposable. \n\nIn general, the peristaltic micropumps of the invention \ninclude a motor, a housing, a housing cover, a roller with \nshoes, and a tube. The tube contains fluids and sits between \nthe shoes on the roller and a rigid wall of the housing. The \nshoes pinch the tube against the wall as the roller is turned \nby an electric motor. Embodiments of the peristaltic micro \npump may include one or more of the following features. \nThe roller or roller assembly may include a bracket upon \nwhich the shoes are mounted, e.g., with axes posts for the \nshoe mounting. The shoes on the roller may be an assembly \nof bearing or bushings that are mounted on the bracket of the \nroller. The minimum number of shoes are tow but typically \nthree, four, or more are provided. The tube may be a module \nmade from elastomer or rubber with a fluidic channel and \nfittings on the channel ends. The channels may be built Such \nthat the module can be pinched. The shape of the channel \nmay be rectangular so that the channel can be easily pinched. \nFurthermore, the shape of the channel can be a specially \ndesigned shape that reduces the friction between the wall of \nthe channel and the shoes on the  roller  and makes the \nchannel  fully  closed by the  compression of the  shoes. \nFurther, the housing cover may include a chamber that is \nbuilt to accommodate a tube or tube module. On both the \nhousing and the housing cover, alignment slots, bushings, \nand spring loaded tips may be provided to keep the tube \nmodule in the position where the shoes on the roller can \npinch the channel in the module properly to cause liquid \nflow. \n\nFIGS. 14 and 15 illustrate a peristaltic micropump 300 \naccording to one embodiment of the invention. This micro \npump 300 may be used for the dispensing mechanisms \nshown in the prior figures with the passive portion being the \nhousing cover 350 and in some cases, the housing 316. As \nshown, the micropump 300 includes a motor 310 (e.g., an \nelectric stepping motor that can be driven by a battery and \ncontrolled by the control and display units described above). \nThe motor is attached to a housing 316 that mates with a \nhousing cover 350. The housing 316 has sidewalls with \nholes 318 for receiving spring-loaded ball  tips  or other \nmechanisms for coupling with a housing cover 350. To \nachieve alignment, a slot 320 is provided in the housing \nsidewalls for receiving and allowing movement of alignment \nrods 322 of the housing cover 350. \n\nDriven by the motor 310 is a roller 330 that mates with a \ndrive shaft 334 of the motor 310. On the roller 330, a number \nof shoes 336 are mounted, e.g., 2 to 4 or more shoes about \nthe periphery of the roller bracket, in a manner that allows \neach of the shoes 330 to spin about its central axis. During \noperation, the roller 330 spins about the central axis of the \nshaft 334, which is driven by motor 310 and the shoes 336 \ncontact an outer tube surface  and spin  while applying \ncompressive forces on the tube surface. \n\nThe micropump 300 is configured such that the active or \ndriving portions (e.g., the roller and shoes) do not contact a \nliquid that is  pumped. To this  end, the  micropump 300 \nincludes a housing cover 350 with recessed surfaces for \nreceiving a tube module 354. The tube module 354 functions \nto position a tube or feed/delivery chamber relative to the \nrotating or rotatable roller 330 and shoes 336 of the active \nportions of the pump. To this end, the module 354 includes \ntube fittings 356 that provide a coupling mechanism (such as \na male tube fitting) formating with a tube (not shown). The \nmodule 354 could be configured with a tube attached to the \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n24 \nfittings 356 that places a tube in an arcuate or curved contact \nsurface 352 in the housing cover (similar as the embodi \nments shown in FIGS. 2-13). \n\nAs shown, though, the module 354 is formed substantially \nas a single molded piece that has openings at the tube fittings \n356 for receiving liquid such as from a tube attached to a \ndrug reservoir (or a cooling reservoir or coolant source) at an \ninlet, for passing liquid through the internal cavity or cham \nber 353 (in FIGS. 17 and 18) of the module, and for passing \nliquid out the other fitting 356 to an outlet tube attached to \nthe  fitting  (e.g.,  a tube  connected to  an administration \nelement (or to a coolant loop or system). The outer Surfaces \nof the  module 354 are configured to  abut the recessed \nsurfaces 357 of the housing cover 350 and to also present a \ncurved wall surface 352 for contacting the shoes 336 of the \nroller 330 when the roller 330 is rotated by the motor 310 via \ndrive shaft 334. In this manner, the tube module 354 defines \nthe  feed or delivery  chamber 353  for  the  solvent/drug \nmixture, coolant, or other liquid while also providing contact \nand positioning Surfaces of the passive portion of a two-part \nperistaltic  pump 300 rather than requiring a tube and a \nspecial configuration in the housing cover 350 to achieve \ntube alignment and to retain  Such a tube in a particular \nposition or channel for contacting the shoes 336. \n\nThe motor 310 used to rotate the roller 330 can be either \na DC motor or a stepping motor. On the housing 316 and the \nhousing cover 350 there are alignment slots 320, 361 and \nrods 322 that keep both parts in position while the housing \ncover 350 is open or closed, such as when the tube of the \ntube module is changed or the tube module 354 is replaced. \nThe housing cover 350 can be tilted up to 180 degrees for \ntube changing. On the housing 316 and the housing cover \n350 there are also spring loaded ball keys 319 and key slots \n358 and key holes 359 that keep the position for the tube \nmodule 354, such that the tube or module is pinched by the \nshoes 336 when the cover 350 is closed onto the housing 316 \nwhen the motor 310 is operated. \n\nIn the embodiment shown in FIG. 17, the module 354 may \ninclude the internal channel 353 and a curved wall 352 for \nreceiving the shoes 336 on roller 330. This arrangement is \nfurther shown in FIG. 18, which shows tubing module 354 \nwith a tube fitting 356 and a channel 353 for directing a \nknown volume or flow of liquid through the module 354. \nDuring operation, the roller 330 with the shoes 336 to \npinch or apply compressive forces on the flexible tube is a \nkey component as  it  is  useful  for  obtaining a positive \ndisplacement and maintain an accurate flow in  the tube \nmodule 354. The roller or roller assembly 330 is shown in \nmore detail in FIG. 16, and, as shown, it includes a bracket \n370 and the shoes 336, with a minimum number of shoes \n336 being two with four being a useful number for many \napplications. On the bracket 370, there are provided bearing \naxis posts 376 upon which bearings 378 with shoes 336 are \nmounted. At the center of the bracket 370, a shaft sleeve is \nprovided for receiving shaft 334, such as with a press fit or \nother mounting technique Such that the sleeve and bracket \nrotate with the shaft 334. The shoes can be bearings or \nbushings, and in this embodiment 300, four bearings 378 for \nshoes 336 are mounted on the axis posts 376 on the bracket \n370. \n\nThe pump tube is typically a consumable part and may be \nfrequently changed to avoid any possible contamination. \nGiven the Small size of the micropump (e.g., several milli \nmeters in its physical dimension and several micrometers to \nhundreds of micrometers on the tube dimension), changing \nsuch tubes may be difficult. Hence, the desirability either to \nprovide a detachable, disposable passive portion as  dis \n\n\fUS RE46,217 E \n\n25 \ncussed with  reference  to  FIGS. 1-13  or to  providing a \ndetachable and replaceable tube module 354 as shown in \nFIGS. 14-18. As shown, the \u201ctube' or feed chamber is \nprovided by the disposable module 354 with its channel 352 \nand its  two tube fittings  356 for providing easy \u201ctube' \nchange outs while providing a desired, known flow  rate \naccuracy. The tube module 354 is made in some cases from \nan elastomeric material that can be squeezed or compressed \nby the roller assembly 330 and its shoes 336. \n\nThe channel 353 may be a rectangular cross  section \nchannel built in or provided inside the tube module 354. The \nwall between the channel 353 and the contact surface 352 \nthat is contacted by the shoes 336 is preferably thin enough \nso that the channel 353 can be squeezed or compressed to \nreduce its  volume to create the desired pressures. The flat \nand rectangular-like shape of the channel 353 makes it easier \nto be squeezed. The dimensions of the channel 353 can be \ndesigned or selected to support a specific flow rates. On both \nends of the tube module 354 there are provided two fittings \n356 for quick fluidic connections with tubes (not shown) \nwith the channel 353 (e.g., to connect the channel to a drug \nreservoir and with an administration element). In the hous \ning cover 350, there is  provided a chamber or recessed \nsurface to accommodate or receive the tube module 354. The \ntube module 354 with the fittings 356 is plugged into the \nrecessed surfaces 357 in the housing cover 350 as shown in \nthe figures. \n\nThe peristaltic  micropump 300 provides a number of \nadvantages. The tube module of the micropump can be \neasily changed while the accuracy is retained. The bearings \nor the bushings (e.g., shoes) on the roller significantly reduce \nthe friction between the shoes and the tube or tube module \nso that the heat generated from friction is decreased and the \nlifetime of the tube is  extended. The channel in the tube \nmodule is, in some cases, rectangular in cross sections and \nthis  shape makes the channel more readily compressible \n(e.g., less compressive force is required). Therefore, the flow \npressure  is  increased  and  the  power  consumption  is \ndecreased. The motor used to rotate the roller can be either \na DC motor or a stepping  motor.  By simply applying \nvariable DC voltage to the motor or sophisticatedly design \ning  a stepping  motor driver and a microcontroller,  the \nmicropump can be automatically controlled for its operation \ntime and its flow rate (e.g., the micropump can readily be \nused to selectively deliver a specific  volume of a drug/ \nSolvent mixture by controlling the timing of motor operation \nand its  speed to deliver a specific flow rate through the \nmicropump). \n\nFIG. 19 shows a cutaway, simplified block embodiment of \nan automated and programmable transdermal drug delivery \ndevice 400 that  can stop  dosing utilizing  a flushing  or \nremoval means or assembly. As shown, the device 400 \nincludes a housing 410, a display 412, a drug reservoir 414 \nfor storing a liquid Such as a drug formulation with a solvent \nand active Substance, a micropump or other dispensing \nmechanism 416, control electronics 460, an administration \nreservoir 440, and a permeable membrane 450.  Further \nincluded are a waste reservoir 420 for storing waste (e.g., \nliquid or drug formulation) removed by actuator or pump \n422 that is in fluid communication with the reservoir 440. \nIn this embodiment, the administration reservoir 440 can \nbe or include a Substrate (not shown) including a plurality of \nmicro-passageways for the drug formulation; a substrate \nformed of micro-structured and/or micro-fabricated reser \nvoirs;  a substrate  including  a series  of miniaturized  or \nmicrostructured reservoirs, a Substrate including a plurality \nof ducts, culverts and/or canals that may be any size, shape, \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n26 \nor  configuration,  and  which  may  be  micro-fabricated \nthrough any number of techniques including etching. More \nspecifically, in certain embodiments where the stoppage of \npermeation or dosing is desired, the active drug formulation \nor solvent initially is moved from the drug reservoir 414 to \nthe administration reservoir 440 such as by controlled opera \ntion  of the  micropump 416 by electronics  460 (e.g.,  a \ncontroller operating to a dosing Subroutine or the like). Then \nafter the desired amount of time elapses to allow transdermal \nabsorption (which may be programmed using the display \n412), the mechanism to  stop dosing, namely the second \nmicropump or actuator 422 is activated by the electronic \ncontroller 460 to remove or flush the liquid or drug formu \nlation and remaining Volumes of the active drug from the \nadministration reservoir 440 to the waste reservoir 420 to \nend permeation through the membrane 450 and adjacent \nskin. \n\nIn another embodiment not shown, the first micropump or \nactuator 416 accomplishes both the dosing into the admin \nistration reservoir 440 and the removal out of the adminis \ntration  reservoir  440 into  the  waste reservoir 420 after \nactivation by the controller electronics 460 that responds to \ndosing instructions programmed into the display 412 by the \nuser.  In the embodiment appearing in  FIG. 19, a second \nmicro pump or actuator 422 accomplishes the removal or \nflushing of drug formulation out of the administration res \nervoir 440 into the waste reservoir 420 after activation by the \ncontroller electronics 460 that responds to dosing instruc \ntions programmed into the display 412 by the user in some \nembodiments or is based on a stored dosing regimen or \nprofile in other cases. \n\nThe micropump or actuator 422 may be connected to an \nadditional reservoir (not shown) containing water or an \ninactive  solution,  and this  reservoir  may be labeled  or \nthought of as an inactive solvent reservoir (or flushing fluid \nsource or reservoir). The second micropump 422 (or the first \nmicropump 416 in  Some embodiments) then  moves the \ninactive drug formulation (e.g., \u201cflushing fluid  that may be \nselected  for its  inactive  characteristics,  to  inactivate  the \nactive substance in the delivered drug formulation, or to \notherwise better control/stop dosing) from the inactive sol \nvent reservoir to the drug administration reservoir 440 to \nforce out or flush  the active drug formulation from the \nadministration reservoir 440 into the waste reservoir 420 or \ninto an area for evaporation (not shown). \n\nIn another embodiment, an air or gas cartridge can be \nutilized to force the active drug compound from the admin \nistration reservoir 440 into the waste reservoir 420 or into an \narea for evaporation pursuant to activation by the controller \nelectronics 460 that responds to  dosing instructions pro \ngrammed into the display 412 by the user. It is important to \nnote that when the administration reservoir 440, which acts \nas the administration depot for the transdermal absorption, is \nnot an absorbent sheet or wick material but a micro-duct or \nculver or liquid passageway, it has at least one side, or a \nseries of holes or openings (or otherwise) that allows the \ndrug formulation to come into  contact with the skin for \ntransdermal absorption, either by passing through a mem \nbrane  on  skin  450  or  otherwise  to  reach  the  skin  for \ntransdermal absorption.  Such an administration reservoir \n440 may take many forms to practice the invention Such as \na Substrate comprising one or a plurality of micro-passage \nways for the drug formulation; a substrate of micro-struc \ntured and/or micro-fabricated reservoirs; a substrate includ \ning a series of miniaturized or micro-structured reservoirs, a \nsubstrate formed with a plurality of ducts, culverts, and/or \ncanals that may be take any size, shape or configuration, and \n\n\fUS RE46,217 E \n\n27 \nwhich may be  micro-fabricated  through any  number of \ntechniques including etching. This administration reservoir \n440 in whatever form it may take may be filled using the \nmicro-pump or actuator 416 to allow for the transdermal \nabsorption, then flushed or emptied, as described above, so \nas to stop or slow drug delivery by removing the active drug \nfrom a position where it can access the skin for transdermal \nabsorption. \n\nAs discussed above, a heating  element may also  be \npresent (e.g., as shown in FIG.9) whether directly formed in \nthe substrate of the administration reservoir 440, provided as \na separate component of the administration reservoir 440 \neither at the top, bottom, or side of the reservoir. This heating \nelement serves  to  increase  the  temperature  of the  skin \nSurface which increases the permeation of the active com \npound through the skin. This heating element aids in the \nmovement of liquids through the passageways that may be \nprovided in the administration reservoir 440. The heating \nelement may also aid in the evaporation of the drug formu \nlation where evaporation is  a desired method to dry the \nadministration area 440 to stop dosing by causing evapora \ntion. This heating element may be programmed to automati \ncally  heat the skin at precise preprogrammed times  for \nprecise timing of permeation enhancement and/or precise \ntiming of stopping of dosing by inducing evaporation. The \nheating element may be configured with a plurality of flow \npaths for vapor or evaporated portions of the liquid (such as \nsolvent vapor) that facilitates relatively uniform or at least \nwell distributed flow away from the reservoir. \n\nA further embodiment that  facilitates  the stopping of \ndosing does not use the first, or introduce a second, micro \npump or actuator to flush or empty the drug formulation \nfrom the administration reservoir 440. Instead, evaporation \nof the drug formulation or more specifically, the solvent, is \ninduced so as to dry the administration reservoir 440 which \nwill result in the stopping of dosing. It is well known that a \ndry skin/administration reservoir interface is not conducive \nto transdermal permeation. In this embodiment, the admin \nistration reservoir has vents or other access either to  the \nenvironment for evaporation, or immediate access by being \nin close proximity to chamber containing a desiccant. This \ndesiccant chamber acts to induce evaporation and captures \nthe solvent vapors to dry the interface and stop dosing. In \nthis embodiment, the heating element, which may be pro \ngrammed via the display 412 or with stored software (e.g., \na dosing profile) to heat at a certain time heats the admin \nistration reservoir 440 and/or skin and/or the whole device \n400 which increases significantly evaporation and speeds up \nthe process  which in  turn  stops  dosing quickly.  As an \nalternative to heat, a gas or air cartridge can be present to \nautomatically,  pursuant to  a programmed Schedule pro \ngrammed into the display 412, blow air or gas onto the \nadministration area to rapidly dry the administration reser \nvoir 440 and stop dosing. \n\nAlthough the invention has been described and illustrated \nwith a certain degree of particularity, it is understood that the \npresent disclosure has been made only by way of example, \nand that numerous changes in the combination and arrange \nment of parts can be resorted to by those skilled in the art \nwithout departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, \nas hereinafter claimed. For example, the devices may also \ninclude components other than heating elements to enhance \ndrug diffusion Such as components to implement iontopho \nresis, Sonophoresis, and/or mechanical or chemical perme \nation enhancers. \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n50 \n\n55 \n\n60 \n\n65 \n\n28 \n\nWe claim: \n1.

No. 61/196,277, filed Oct.  15, 2008, and U.S. \nProvisional Application Ser. No. 61/204,714, filed Jan. 9. \n2009. The entire contents of each above-mentioned appli \ncation are herein incorporated by reference in their entire \nties. \n\nTECHNICAL FIELD \n0002  The present invention relates to organic chemistry, \nformulation chemistry, and protein  chemistry applied to \npharmaceutical research and development. Aspects of the \npresent invention provide highly concentrated drug particle \nformulations, Suspension formulations comprising Such par \nticle formulations, devices comprising Such suspension for \nmulations, and uses thereof for the treatment of diseases or \nconditions. \n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n0003  Drugs, including proteins, peptides, and polypep \ntides tend to degrade over time in aqueous Solution, that is, \nthey are typically unstable in aqueous Solution. Because of \nthis  chemical instability,  drugs in  solution are often  not \nSuitable for long-term storage or use in drug delivery devices \nthat provide prolonged delivery of a drug.  Furthermore, \ndrugs with short in vivo half-lives are particularly difficult to \nformulate for storage and delivery. Drug formulations con \ntinue to suffer from important drawbacks that limit their use, \nespecially with respect to their method of delivery (e.g., \nSubcutaneous or intravenous injection) and in the ability to \nbe administered in Sufficient therapeutic dosages. Improve \nments  are  needed in  drug formulation  and delivery  to \nimprove patient compliance and expand drug availability. \n0004  Carriers in which drugs do not dissolve but rather \nare suspended have been shown to improve chemical sta \nbility (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,972,370 and 5,904,935). Fur \nthermore, it can be beneficial to Suspend the beneficial agent \nin a carrier when the agent exhibits low solubility in the \ndesired vehicle. However, Suspensions can have poor physi \ncal stability due to settling, chemical instability, and aggre \ngation of the Suspended beneficial agent. A further problem \nis the ability to achieve the necessary concentration of drug \nin the vehicle to, for example, provide prolonged delivery. \nThe problems with non-aqueous carriers tend to be exacer \nbated as the concentration of drug is increased. \n0005.  Several approaches have been taken  to  achieve \nprolonged delivery  of a drug at  a controlled  rate.  For \nexample, Brodbeck, et al., have described depot gel com \npositions that can be injected into a desired location and \nprovide sustained release of a drug (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,673, \n767; 6,468,961; 6,331,311; and 6,130,200). \n0006  Implantable  infusion  pumps  have  also  been \ndescribed for delivering drugs by intravenous, intraarterial, \nintrathecal,  intraperitoneal,  and epidural  pathways.  Such \n\npumps are typically Surgically inserted Subcutaneously into \na pocket of tissue in the lower abdomen provide for con \ntrolled delivery of a drug. A number of systems for insulin \ndelivery,  pain  management,  and  chemotherapy  delivery \nhave  been  described  (e.g.,  Health  Services/Technology \nAssessment Text (HSTAT). External and Implantable Infu \nsion Pumps, by Ann A. Graham, C.R.N.A., M.P.H., Thomas \nV.  Holohan,  M.D.,  Health  Technology  Review,  No.  7, \nAgency for Health Care Policy and Research Office of \nHealth Technology Assessment, January 1994). \n0007  Another approach for prolonged delivery of a drug \nuses  osmotic  delivery  devices.  Such  a  device  can  be \nimplanted into a subject to release a drug in a controlled \nmanner for a predetermined administration period. In gen \neral,  these  devices  operate  by imbibing  fluid  from the \noutside environment and releasing amounts of the drug \ncorresponding to the imbibed fluid. An example of one Such \nosmotic delivery device is the VIADURR (ALZA Corpo \nration.  Mountain View,  Calif.)  device.  The VIADUR(R) \ndevice is  a titanium  implant drug-delivery system using \nDUROS(R) (ALZA Corporation,  Mountain View,  Calif.) \ntechnology  to  manage  the  symptoms  associated  with \nadvanced (stage 4) prostate cancer by delivering leuprolide \nacetate. Treatment using the VIADUR(R) device reduces the \namount of testosterone produced and circulated in a Sub \nject's  body  and provides  a  continuous  therapy  for  12 \nmonths. \n0008  For prolonged delivery of a drug, dosing durations \nof up to a year are desirable. Such long-term storage of drugs \nat physiological temperatures presents  many challenges. \nOne such challenge is that settling of the drug in a liquid \nformulation can occur, which can result in heterogeneity of \nthe drug in the drug suspension. Another challenge is the \nability  to  obtain  a  suspension  formulation  that  can be \nreliably pumped from a delivery device for prolonged deliv \nery. A third challenge is the ability to deliver high doses of \ndrug over time when constrained by the typically small \nvolumes available in implantable delivery devices for stor \nage of drug. For example, implant reservoirs are generally \non the order of 25-250 ul. \n0009.  The above-described  devices  and  formulations \nhave been useful for delivering drugs to Subjects. Although \nthese devices have found application for human and veteri \nnary  purposes,  there  remains  a  need  for  formulations, \ndevices, and methods of administration that are capable of \ndelivering drug at  desired therapeutic concentrations  for \nprolonged duration and that provide drug stability  over \nextended periods of time. The highly concentrated drug \nparticle formulations of the present invention provide solu \ntions  to  many of the challenges  and problems outlined \nabove. The present invention provides  needed improve \nments in,  for example, drug formulation and delivery to \nimprove longer duration, patient compliance, types of drugs \navailable for use, and drug stability. \n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n0010.  The present invention generally relates to highly \nconcentrated drug particle formulations and Suspension for \nmulations comprising a highly concentrated drug particle \nformulation and a suspension vehicle, as well as devices \ncomprising Such formulations,  methods of making Such \nformulations and devices, and methods of use thereof. \n0011.  In one aspect, the present invention relates to a \nhighly  concentrated  drug  particle  formulation.

Further \nexamples of useful proteins include recombinant antibodies, \nantibody  fragments,  humanized antibodies,  single  chain \nantibodies, monoclonal antibodies, avimers, human growth \nhormone, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, \nplatelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor, \nnerve growth factor, and cytokines. \n0015.  In one embodiment, the particles of the particle \nformulation are particles of between about 2 microns to \nabout 10 microns. Typically, particles formed, for example, \nby spray drying have a range of defined sizes represented by \ncurve centered around an average value. In one embodiment, \nthe curve is a bell-shaped curve and the average particle size \nis between about 2 microns to about 10 microns. \n0016.  In second aspect, the present invention relates to a \nSuspension formulation comprising a highly concentrated \ndrug particle formulation and a Suspension vehicle. In one \nembodiment, a Suspension formulation comprises a highly \nconcentrated drug particle formulation of the present inven \ntion and a non-aqueous, single-phase Suspension vehicle. \nThe Suspension vehicle typically comprises one or more \npolymer and one or more solvent. The Suspension vehicle \nexhibits viscous fluid characteristics and the particle formu \nlation is homogeneously dispersed in the vehicle. \n0017.  In one embodiment, the polymer of the suspension \nvehicle comprises a polymer comprising pyrrolidones (e.g., \npolyvinylpyrrolidone). \n\n0018.  The solvent for a suspension vehicle can be, for \nexample, lauryl lactate, lauryl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, or \nmixtures thereof. \n0019.  In some embodiments, the suspension vehicle con \nsists essentially of one or more polymer and one or more \nSolvent. For example, the solvent can consist essentially of \nbenzyl benzoate. The polymer can, for example, consist \nessentially of polyvinylpyrrolidone. In one embodiment, the \nSuspension vehicle consists essentially of benzyl benzoate \nand a polymer comprising pyrrolidones. \n0020.  The proportions of polymer to solvent in the sus \npension vehicle may be varied, for example, the Suspension \nvehicle may comprise about 40 wt % to about 80 wt % \npolymer(s) and about 20 wt % to about 60 wt % solvent(s). \nPreferred  embodiments of a suspension  vehicle  include \nvehicles formed of polymer(s) and solvent(s) combined at \nthe following ratios: about 25 wt % solvent and about 75 wt \n% polymer; about 50 wt % solvent and about 50 wt % \npolymer; and about 75 wt % solvent and about 25 wt % \npolymer. \n0021.  The suspension vehicle typically has a viscosity, at \n33\u00b0 C.,  of between about 5,000 to  about 30,000 poise, \npreferably between about 8,000 to about 25,000 poise, more \npreferably between about 10,000 to about 20,000 poise. In \none embodiment, the Suspension vehicle has a viscosity of \nabout 15,000 poise, plus or minus about 3,000 poise, at 33\u00b0 \nC. \n0022.  In a third aspect, the present invention relates to an \nosmotic delivery device comprising a Suspension formula \ntion comprising a highly concentrated drug particle formu \nlation of the present invention and a suspension vehicle. \n0023.

The phrase \u201cphase separation' as used herein refers \nto  the formation  of multiple phases (e.g.,  liquid  or gel \nphases) in the Suspension vehicle. Such as when the Suspen \nsion vehicle contacts the aqueous environment.  In some \nembodiments  of the  present  invention,  the  Suspension \nvehicle  is  formulated to  exhibit phase  separation  upon \ncontact  with  an  aqueous  environment having  less  than \napproximately 10% water. \n0047.

The term \u201cviscosity  as used herein typically refers \nto a value determined from the ratio of shear stress to shear \nrate  (see,  e.g.,  Considine,  D.  M. & Considine, G.  D., \nEncyclopedia of Chemistry, 4th  Edition,  Van  Nostrand, \nReinhold, N.Y., 1984) essentially as follows: \n\n(Equation 1) \n\nwhere F/A-shear stress (force per unit area), \np a proportionality constant (viscosity), and \n\n0.052 \n0053 \n0.054  V/L=the velocity per layer thickness (shear rate). \n0055  From this relationship, the ratio of shear stress to \nshear rate defines viscosity. Measurements of shear stress \nand shear rate are typically determined using parallel plate \nrheometry performed under selected conditions (e.g., a tem \nperature of about 37\u00b0 C.). Other methods for the determi \nnation of viscosity  include,  measurement of a kinematic \nViscosity using a viscometer, for example, a Cannon-Fenske \nviscometer, an Ubbelohde viscometer for the Cannon-Fen \nske opaque Solution, or a Ostwald Viscometer. Generally, \nSuspension vehicles of the present invention have a viscosity \nsufficient to prevent a particle formulation suspended therein \nfrom settling during storage and use in a method of delivery, \nfor example, in an implantable drug delivery device. \n0056.  The term \u201cnon-aqueous\u201d as used herein refers to an \noverall  moisture content,  for example, of a Suspension \nformulation, typically of less than or equal to about 10 wt %, \npreferably less than or equal to about 7 wt %, more prefer \nably less than or equal to about 5 wt %, and more preferably \nless than about 4 wt %. \n0057  The term \u201csubject\u201d as used herein refers to any \nmember of the  subphylum Chordata,  including,  without \nlimitation, humans and other primates, including non-human \nprimates such as rhesus macaques and other monkey species \nand chimpanzees and other ape species; farm animals such \nas cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and horses; domestic mammals \nSuch as dogs and cats; laboratory animals including rodents \nSuch as mice, rats and guinea pigs; and birds, including \ndomestic, wild and game birds such as chickens, turkeys and \nother gallinaceous birds, ducks, geese, and the like.

The term \u201cosmotic delivery device\u201d as used herein \ntypically refers to a device used for delivery of one or more \nbeneficial agent (e.g.,  an incretin  mimetic) to  a subject, \nwherein the  device comprises, for example, a reservoir \n(made, e.g.,  from a titanium alloy) having a lumen that \ncontains  a Suspension  formulation  (e.g.,  comprising an \nincretin  mimetic) and an  osmotic agent  formulation. A \npiston assembly positioned in the lumen isolates the Sus \npension formulation from the osmotic agent formulation. A \nsemipermeable membrane positioned at a first distal end of \nthe reservoir adjacent the osmotic agent formulation, as well \nas a flow modulator (which defines a delivery orifice through \nwhich the suspension formulation exits the device) that is \npositioned at a second distal end of the reservoir adjacent the \nSuspension  formulation.  Typically,  the  osmotic  delivery \ndevice is implanted within the Subject, for example, Subcu \ntaneously (e.g., in the inside, outside, or back of the upper \narm;  or in the abdominal area).  An exemplary osmotic \ndelivery  device  is  the  DUROS(R)  (ALZA Corporation, \nMountain View, Calif.) delivery device. \n0059.  The term  \u201ccontinuous delivery\u201d  as  used herein \ntypically refers to a Substantially continuous release of drug \nfrom  an  osmotic  delivery  device.  For  example,  the \nDUROSR delivery device releases drug at a predetermined \nrate based on the principle of osmosis. Extracellular fluid \nenters  the  DUROSR) device through  the semipermeable \nmembrane directly into the osmotic engine that expands to \ndrive the piston at a slow and consistent rate of travel. \nMovement of the piston forces the drug formulation to be \nreleased through the orifice of the diffusion moderator. Thus \nrelease of the drug from the osmotic delivery device is \ncontinuous at a slow, controlled, consistent rate. \n0060.  The term  \u201csubstantial  steady-state  delivery\u201d  as \nused herein typically refers to delivery of a drug at or near \na target level over a defined period of time, wherein the \namount of the drug being delivered from an osmotic device \nis substantially zero-order delivery. \n\n2.O.O GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE \nINVENTION \n\n0061 \nBefore describing the present invention in detail, it \nis  to be understood that this  invention  is  not limited to \nparticular types of drug delivery, particular types of drug \ndelivery  devices,  particular  sources  of drugs,  particular \nSolvents, particular polymers, and the like, as use of Such \nparticulars may be selected in view of the teachings of the \npresent specification.

GIP circulates  as  a  biologically  active \n42-amino acid protein. GIP is known both as gastric inhibi \ntory peptide and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide. \nGIP is a 42-amino acid gastrointestinal regulatory peptide \nthat stimulates insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells in \nthe presence of glucose (Tseng, C., et al., PNAS 90:1992 \n1996 (1993)).

The leptin \nprotein (encoded by the Obese (Ob) gene), analogs, and \nderivatives have been proposed for use as modulators for the \ncontrol of weight and adiposity of animals, including mam \nmals and humans. The sequence of leptin, as well as analogs \nand derivatives thereof, are known in the art (e.g., U.S. Pat. \nNos. 6,734,106; 6,777,388; 7.307,142; and 7,112,659; PCT \nInternational Publication No. WO 96/05309). \n0093.

In practice, \nthis will vary depending upon Such variables, for example, \nas the particular agent, the site of delivery, the severity of the \ncondition,  and the  desired  therapeutic  effect.  Beneficial \nagents and their dosage unit amounts are known to the prior \nart in Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of \nTherapeutics, 11th Ed., (2005), McGraw Hill; Remington's \nPharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., (1995), Mack Publishing \n\n\fUS 2017/01 19854 A1 \n\nMay 4, 2017 \n\nCo.; and Martin\u2019s Physical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical \nSciences,  1.00  edition  (2005),  Lippincott  Williams  & \nWilkins.  Typically,  for an osmotic delivery  system,  the \nVolume of the chamber comprising the drug formulation is \nbetween about 100 ul to about 1000 ul,  more preferably \nbetween about 140 ul and about 200 ul. In one embodiment, \nthe Volume of the chamber comprising the drug formulation \nis about 150 ul. \n0102  Highly concentrated drug particle formulations of \nthe invention are preferably chemically and physically stable \nfor at  least  about  1  month, at  least  about  1.5  months, \npreferably at least about 3 months, preferably at least about \n6 months, more preferably at least about 9 months, more \npreferably at least about 12 months at delivery temperature. \nThe delivery temperature is typically normal human body \ntemperature, for example, about 37\u00b0 C., or slightly higher, \nfor example, about 40\u00b0 C. Further, highly concentrated drug \nparticle formulations of the present invention are preferably \nchemically and physically stable for at least about 3 months, \npreferably at least about 6 months, more preferably at least \nabout  12  months,  at  storage  temperature.  Examples of \nstorage temperatures include refrigeration temperature, for \nexample, about 5\u00b0 C., or room temperature, for example, \nabout 25\u00b0 C. \n0103)  A highly concentrated drug particle formulation \nmay be considered chemically stable if less than about 25%, \npreferably less than about 20%, more preferably less than \nabout 15%, more preferably less than about 10%, and more \npreferably less than about 5% breakdown products of the \ndrug particles are formed after about 3 months, preferably \nafter about 6 months, preferably after about 12 months at \ndelivery temperature and after about 6 months, after about \n12 months, and preferably after about 24 months at storage \ntemperature. \n0104.  A highly concentrated drug particle formulation \nmay be considered physically stable if less than about 10%, \npreferably less than about 5%, more preferably less than \nabout 3%, more preferably less than 1% aggregates of the \ndrug are formed after about 3 months, preferably after about \n6 months, at delivery temperature and about 6 months, \npreferably about 12 months, at storage temperature. \n0105  Example 3A presents exemplary data related to the \nstability of the highly concentrated drug particle formula \ntions of the present invention. \n0106  When the drug in  the highly concentrated drug \nparticle formulation is a protein, the protein solution is kept \nin a frozen condition and lyophilized or spray dried to a solid \nstate. Tg (glass transition temperature) may be one factor to \nconsider in achieving stable compositions of protein. While \nnot intending to be bound by any particular theory, the \ntheory of formation of a high Tg amorphous solid to stabilize \npeptides,  polypeptides,  or proteins  has been utilized  in \npharmaceutical industry. Generally, if an amorphous Solid \nhas a higher Tg, such as 100\u00b0 C., proteins will not have \nmobility when stored at room temp or even at 40\u00b0C. because \nthe storage temperature is below the Tg. Calculations using \nmolecular information have shown that if a glass transition \ntemperature is above a storage temperature of 50\u00b0 C. that \nthere  is  Zero  mobility  for  molecules.  Zero  mobility  of \nmolecules correlates with better stability. Tg is also depen \ndent on the  moisture  level  in  the  product formulation. \nGenerally,  the  more moisture,  the  lower the Tg of the \ncomposition. \n\n0107  Accordingly, in some aspects of the present inven \ntion,  excipients  with higher Tg may be included in the \nprotein  formulation  to  improve  stability,  for  example, \nsucrose (Tg-75\u00b0 C.) and trehalose (Tg  110\u00b0 C.). Preferably, \nparticle formulations are formable into particles using pro \ncesses  Such as  spray  drying,  lyophilization,  desiccation, \nfreeze-drying, milling, granulation, ultrasonic drop creation, \ncrystallization, precipitation, or other techniques available in \nthe art for forming particles from a mixture of components. \nThe particles are preferably substantially uniform in shape \nand size. \n0108.  A typical  spray  dry  process  may include,  for \nexample, loading a spray Solution containing a small mol \necule or protein, for example, an incretin  mimetic (e.g., \nexenatide;  Example 1),  and stabilizing excipients into  a \nsample chamber. The sample chamber is typically  main \ntained at a desired temperature, for example, refrigeration to \nroom temperature. Refrigeration generally promotes stabil \nity  of the  drug.  A solution,  emulsion,  or Suspension is \nintroduced to the spray dryer where the fluid is atomized into \ndroplets. Droplets can be formed by use of a rotary atomizer, \npressure nozzle, pneumatic nozzle, or Sonic nozzle. The mist \nof droplets is immediately brought into contact with a drying \ngas in a drying chamber. The drying gas removes solvent \nfrom the droplets and carries the particles into a collection \nchamber.  In  spray  drying,  factors  that  can  affect  yield \ninclude, but are not limited to, localized charges on particles \n(which may promote adhesion of the particles to the spray \ndryer) and aerodynamics of the particles (which may make \nit difficult to collect the particles). In general, yield of the \nspray dry process depends in part on the particle formula \ntion. \n0109.  In one embodiment of the present invention, the \nparticles are sized such that they can be delivered via an \nimplantable osmotic drug delivery device. Uniform shape \nand size of the particles typically helps to provide a consis \ntent and uniform rate of release from such a delivery device, \nhowever, a particle preparation having a non-normal particle \nsize distribution profile may also be used. For example, in a \ntypical implantable osmotic delivery device having a deliv \nery orifice, the size of the particles is less than about 30%, \nmore preferably is less than about 20%, more preferably is \nless than about than 10%, of the diameter of the delivery \norifice. In an embodiment of the particle formulation for use \nwith an osmotic  delivery  system,  wherein  the  delivery \norifice diameter of the implant is  about 0.5 mm, particle \nsizes may be, for example, less than about 150 microns to \nabout 50 microns. In an embodiment of the particle formu \nlation for use with an osmotic delivery system, wherein the \ndelivery orifice diameter of the implant is about 0.1  mm, \nparticle  sizes  may be,  for example, less  than about 30 \nmicrons to about 10 microns. In one embodiment, the orifice \nis about 0.25 mm (250 microns) and the particle size is about \n2 microns to about 5 microns. \n0110  Typically, the particles of the particle formulations \nof the present invention when incorporated in a Suspension \nvehicle do not settle in less than about 3 months, preferably \ndo not settle in less than about 6 months, more preferably do \nnot settle in less than about 12 months, more preferably do \nnot settle in less than about 24 months at delivery tempera \nture, and most preferably do not settle in less than about 36 \nmonths at delivery temperature. The Suspension vehicles \ntypically have a viscosity of between about 5,000 to about \n30,000 poise,  preferably  between about 8,000 to  about \n\n\fUS 2017/01 19854 A1 \n\nMay 4, 2017 \n\n25,000 poise,  more preferably between about  10,000 to \nabout 20,000 poise.  In one embodiment, the suspension \nvehicle has a viscosity of about 15,000 poise, plus or minus \nabout 3,000 poise.  Generally speaking, smaller particles \ntend to have a lower settling rate in  Viscous Suspension \nvehicles than larger particles. Accordingly, micron- to nano \nsized particles are typically desirable. Based on simulation \nmodeling studies, in  Viscous Suspension formulation par \nticles of about 2 microns to about 10 microns of the present \ninvention are not expected to settle for at least 20 years at \nroom temperature. In an embodiment of the particle formu \nlation of the present invention, for use in an implantable \nosmotic delivery device, comprises particles of sizes less \nthan about 50 microns, more preferably less than about 10 \nmicrons, more preferably in a range from about 2 to about \n7 microns. \n0111.  In one embodiment, a highly concentrated drug \nparticle formulation of the present invention comprises one \nor more drug, as described above, and one or more addi \ntional component (e.g., one or more stabilizers). Stabilizers \nmay be, for example, carbohydrate, antioxidant, amino acid, \nbuffer, inorganic compound, or Surfactant. The amounts of \nstabilizers  and buffer in  the particle formulation can be \ndetermined experimentally based on the activities of the \nstabilizers and buffers and the desired characteristics of the \nformulation. Typically, the amount of carbohydrate in the \nformulation is determined by aggregation concerns. In gen \neral, the carbohydrate level should not be too high so as to \navoid promoting crystal growth in the presence of water due \nto  excess carbohydrate unbound to  drug. Typically,  the \namount of antioxidant in the formulation is determined by \noxidation concerns, while the amount of amino acid in the \nformulation is  determined by oxidation  concerns and/or \nformability of particles during spray drying. Typically, the \namount of buffer in the formulation is determined by pre \nprocessing concerns, stability concerns, and formability of \nparticles during spray drying. Buffer may be required to \nstabilize the drug during processing, e.g., Solution prepara \ntion and spray drying, when all excipients are solubilized. \n0112  Examples of carbohydrates that may be included in \nthe particle  formulation include, but are  not limited to, \nmonosaccharides (e.g.,  fructose,  maltose, galactose, glu \ncose, D-mannose, and Sorbose), disaccharides (e.g., lactose, \nSucrose, trehalose, and cellobiose), polysaccharides (e.g., \nraffinose, melezitose, maltodextrins, dextrans, and starches), \nand alditols (acyclic polyols; e.g., mannitol, Xylitol, maltitol, \nlactitol. Xylitol Sorbitol, pyranosyl Sorbitol, and myoinsitol). \nPreferred carbohydrates include disaccharides and/or non \nreducing Sugars, such as Sucrose, trehalose, and raffinose. \n0113.  Examples of antioxidants that may be included in \nthe particle  formulation include, but are  not limited to, \nmethionine,  ascorbic  acid,  sodium thiosulfate,  catalase, \nplatinum,  ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  (EDTA), citric \nacid, cysteins, thioglycerol, thioglycolic acid, thiosorbitol, \nbutylated hydroxanisol, butylated hydroxyltoluene, and pro \npyl gallate. Further, amino acids that readily oxidize can be \nused as antioxidants, for example, cysteine, methionine, and \ntryptophan. A preferred antioxidant is methionine. \n0114  Examples of amino acids that may be included in \nthe particle  formulation include, but are  not limited to, \narginine, methionine, glycine, histidine, alanine, L-leucine, \nglutamic  acid,  iso-leucine,  L-threonine,  2-phenylamine, \nvaline, norvaline, praline, phenylalanine, trytophan, serine, \nasparagines, cysteine, tyrosine, lysine, and norleucine. Pre \n\nferred amino acids include those that readily oxidize, e.g., \ncysteine, methionine, and tryptophan. \n0115  Examples of buffers that may be included in the \nparticle formulation include, but are not limited to, citrate, \nhistidine, Succinate, phosphate, maleate, tris, acetate, carbo \nhydrate, and gly-gly. Preferred buffers include citrate, his \ntidine, Succinate, and tris. \n0116  Examples of inorganic compounds that  may be \nincluded in  the particle formulation include, but are not \nlimited to, NaCl, NaSO4, NaHCO, KC1, KHPO4, CaCl, \nand MgCl2. \n0117.  In addition, the particle formulation may include \nother excipients, such as Surfactants and salts. Examples of \nsurfactants include, but are not limited to, Polysorbate 20, \nPolysorbate 80, PLURONICR) (BASF Corporation, Mount \nOlive,  N.J.)  F68,  and  sodium  dodecyl  sulfate  (SDS). \nExamples of salts include, but are not limited to, sodium \nchloride, calcium chloride, and magnesium chloride. \n0118  All components included in the particle formula \ntion  are  typically  acceptable  for pharmaceutical  use  in \nmammals, in particular, in humans. \n0119  Table 1  below presents examples of particle for \nmulation  composition ranges for particles  comprising a \nprotein (range values are approximate, e.g., in the \u201cRange' \ncolumn, protein is present at about 25 wt % to about 80 wt \n%). Although preferred embodiments include protein, car \nbohydrate, antioxidant and/or amino acid, and buffer, some \nembodiments may, for example, include only protein and \ncarbohydrate; protein and antioxidant; protein and buffer; \nprotein, carbohydrate and antioxidant; protein, carbohydrate \nand buffer;  protein, antioxidant, and buffer;  wherein the \nprotein wt % range is as given in Table 1 and the remaining \nwt % is made up by the selected additional component(s). \nAccordingly, in some embodiments the particle formulation \nmay comprise selected components and in other embodi \nments consist essentially of selected components.

Several exem \nplary embodiments of the highly concentrated drug particle \nformulations  of the  present  invention  are  set  forth  in \nExample 1, wherein the drug is a protein. \n0121  Table 2 below presents examples of particle for \nmulation composition ranges for particles  comprising an \nincretin mimetic, such as, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP \n1), a derivative of GLP-1 (e.g., GLP-1 (7-36)amide), or an \nanalogue of GLP-1, exenatide, a derivative of exenatide, or \nan analogue of exenatide.  The description  of particular \nembodiments described  for Table  1  also  applies  to  the \nformulations described in Table 2. \n\nTABLE 2 \n\nPreferred \nRange \n(% by weight)  (% by weight)  (% by weight) \n\nRange \n\nMore \nPreferred \nRange \n\nO.1 to 99.9 \n\n1 to 60 \n\nS to SO \n\n1 to 99 \nO.1 to 99 \n\nS to 95 \nS to 70 \n\n20 to 80 \nS to SO \n\nO.1 to 99 \n\nS to 70 \n\nS to SO \n\nParticle loading in \nSuspension \nformulations \nIn Particles \n\nProtein \nCarbohydrate and/or \nAntioxidant andfor \namino acid \nBuffer \n\n0122)  Within these weight percent ranges for components \nof the particle formulation, some preferred component ratios \nare as follows: drug to one or more additional component \n(e.g., stabilizer(s)) at ratios of 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 2.5:1, \n5:1, 10:1, 16:1, and 20:1, preferably between about 1:4 to \n10:1 (i.e., about 1-10:4-1), or preferably between about 1:3 \nto 5:1 (i.e.,  1-5:3-1). The present invention also includes \nranges corresponding to  all  of these  drug to  additional \ncomponents (e.g., stabilizer(s)) ratios, for example, between \nabout 1:1 to 2:1 (i.e.,  1-2: 1) between about 1:4 and about \n20:1 (i.e., about 1-20:4-1), between about 1:4 to about 16:1 \n(i.e., about 1-16:4-1), between about 1:3 to about 10:1 (i.e., \nabout 1-10:3-1), between about 1:2 to about 20:1 (i.e., about \n1-20:2-1), and so on. \n0123.  Accordingly, in one aspect the present invention \nincludes a particle formulation comprising about 25 wt % to \nabout 80 wt %, preferably about 40 wt % to about 75 wt %, \nof drug; and about 75% wt % to about 20% wt %, preferably \nabout 60% wt % to  about 25% wt % of one or more \nadditional component, for example, stabilizers selected from \nthe group consisting of antioxidant, carbohydrate, and buf \nfer, wherein the ratio of drug:antioxidant:carbohydrate:buf \nfer is between about 2-20:1-5:1-5:1-10, preferably between \nabout 5-10: 1-2.5:1-2.5:1-5. Typically the particle formula \ntions of the present invention comprise less than about 10 wt \n%, preferably less than about 5 wt %, residual moisture. \n0.124.  An example of a particle formulation of the present \ninvention includes, but is not limited to, the protein a drug, \nmethionine an antioxidant,  Sucrose a carbohydrate,  and \ncitrate a buffer,  wherein the protein constitutes  between \nabout 40 wt % to about 70 wt % of the particle formulation \nand the ratio of protein to additional components is between \n\nabout 1:2 and 3:1  (i.e.,  about 1-3:2-1). Specific proteins \nexemplified below include an interferon and an incretin \nmimetic (Example 1). \n0.125.  In summary, a selected drug or combination of \ndrugs is formulated into a dried powder in Solid state, which \npreserves maximum chemical and biological stability of the \ndrug.  The particle  formulation  offers  long-term  storage \nstability at high temperature and thus allows delivery to a \nsubject of stable and biologically effective drug for extended \nperiods of time. In one embodiment, peptides, polypeptides, \nor proteins in highly concentrated drug particle formulations \nof the present invention are stabile for transportation and/or \nstorage without the requirement of refrigeration or freezing. \nIn the absence of the stabilization provided by the highly \nconcentrated drug particle formulations of the present inven \ntion, peptides, polypeptides, or proteins may be unstable for \ntransporting and/or storing or may otherwise require cold or \nfrozen conditions for transporting and storing. For example, \na highly concentrated drug particle formulation placed into \na sterile vial or ampoule. At the time of use, the particle \nformulations of the present invention can be quickly recon \nstituted with, for example, water-for-injection to create a \nhighly concentrated aqueous solution just prior to adminis \ntering a bolus injection to a subject. \n0.126 \nParticle size distribution of the dry particle powder \ncan be well  controlled (0.1  micron  to  20 micron), for \nexample, by using the methods of spray drying or lyophiliza \ntion to prepare the particle formulations. The process param \neters for formation of the dry powder are optimal to produce \nparticles with desired particle size distribution, density, and \nSurface area. \nI0127.  The selected excipients and buffer in the highly \nconcentrated drug particle formulation may provide,  for \nexample, the following functions: density modification of \nthe dry powder; preservation of the drug chemical stability; \nmaintenance of the drugs physical stability (e.g., high glass \ntransition temperature, and avoiding phase to phase transi \ntion),  producing homogenous dispersions  in  Suspension; \nmodification  of hydrophobicity  and/or hydrophilicity  to \nmanipulate dry powder Solubility in selected Solvents; and \nmanipulation of pH during processing and maintenance of \npH in the product (for solubility and stability). \n\n3.2.0 Vehicle Formulations and Suspension \nFormulations \nI0128.  In one aspect of the present invention, the suspen \nsion vehicle provides a stable environment in  which the \nhighly concentrated drug particle formulation is dispersed. \nThe highly  concentrated  drug particle  formulations  are \nchemically and physically stable (as described above) in the \nSuspension vehicle. The Suspension vehicle typically com \nprises one or more polymer and one or more solvent that \nform a solution of Sufficient viscosity to uniformly Suspend \nthe particles comprising the drug. The Suspension vehicle \nmay comprise further components, including, but not limited \nto,  Surfactants,  antioxidants,  and/or  other  compounds \nsoluble in the vehicle. \nI0129.  The viscosity of the suspension vehicle is typically \nSufficient to prevent the highly concentrated drug particle \nformulation from settling during storage and use in a method \nof delivery, for example, in an implantable drug delivery \ndevice. The suspension vehicle is biodegradable in that the \nSuspension  vehicle  disintegrates  or breaks down over a \nperiod of time in response to a biological environment, while \n\n\fUS 2017/01 19854 A1 \n\nMay 4, 2017 \n\nthe highly concentrated drug particle is  dissolved in the \nbiological environment and the active pharmaceutical ingre \ndient in the particle is absorbed. \n0130.  The solvent in which the polymer is dissolved may \naffect characteristics of the Suspension formulation, Such as \nthe behavior of the highly concentrated drug particle for \nmulation  during  storage.  A solvent  may be selected  in \ncombination with a polymer so that the resulting Suspension \nvehicle exhibits phase separation  upon contact with the \naqueous environment. In some embodiments of the inven \ntion, the solvent may be selected in combination with the \npolymer so that the resulting Suspension vehicle exhibits \nphase separation upon contact with the aqueous environment \nhaving less than approximately about 10% water. \n0131  The solvent may be an acceptable solvent that is \nnot miscible with water. The solvent may also be selected so \nthat the polymer is soluble in the solvent at high concen \ntrations, such as at a polymer concentration of greater than \nabout 30%. Examples of solvents useful in the practice of \nthe present invention include, but are not limited to, lauryl \nalcohol,  benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, lauryl  lactate, \ndecanol (also called decyl alcohol), ethylhexyl lactate, and \nlong chain (Cs to C) aliphatic alcohols, esters, or mixtures \nthereof. The solvent used in the suspension vehicle may be \n\u201cdry,\u201d  in  that  it  has a low  moisture content.  Preferred \nsolvents for use in formulation of the suspension vehicle \ninclude lauryl lactate, lauryl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, and \nmixtures thereof. \n0132  Examples of polymers for formulation of the sus \npension vehicles of the present invention include, but are not \nlimited to,  a polyester (e.g.,  polylactic  acid or polylac \nticpolyglycolic acid);  a polymer comprising pyrrolidones \n(e.g.,  polyvinylpyrrolidone  (PVP)  having  a  molecular \nweight ranging from approximately 2,000 to approximately \n1,000,000); ester or ether of an unsaturated alcohol (e.g., \nvinyl  acetate);  polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block \ncopolymer, or mixtures thereof.  In one embodiment, the \npolymer is  PVP having a molecular weight of 2,000 to \n1,000,000. In a preferred embodiment the polymer is poly \nvinylpyrrolidone  K-17 (typically  having an approximate \naverage molecular weight range of 7,900-10,800). Polyvi \nnylpyrrolidone can be characterized by its  K-value (e.g., \nK-17), which is a viscosity index. The polymer used in the \nSuspension vehicle may include one or more different poly \nmers or may include different grades of a single polymer. \nThe polymer used in the Suspension vehicle may also be dry \nor have a low moisture content. \nGenerally speaking, a suspension vehicle accord \n0.133 \ning to the present invention may vary in composition based \non the desired performance characteristics. In one embodi \nment, the Suspension vehicle may comprise about 40 wt % \nto about 80 wt % polymer(s) and about 20 wt % to about 60 \nwt % solvent(s).  Preferred embodiments of a suspension \nvehicle include vehicles formed of polymer(s) and solvent(s) \ncombined at the following ratios: about 25 wt % solvent and \nabout 75 wt % polymer; about 50 wt % solvent and about 50 \nwt % polymer; and about 75 wt % solvent and about 25 wt \n% polymer. Accordingly, in Some embodiments the Suspen \nsion vehicle may comprise selected components and in other \nembodiments consist essentially of selected components. \n0134.  The suspension vehicle  may exhibit Newtonian \nbehavior. The suspension vehicle is typically formulated to \nprovide a viscosity that maintains a uniform dispersion of \nthe particle formulation for a predetermined period of time. \n\nThis helps facilitate making a suspension formulation tai \nlored to provide controlled delivery of the drug contained in \nthe highly concentrated drug particle formulation. The vis \ncosity of the Suspension vehicle may vary depending on the \ndesired application, the size and type of the particle formu \nlation, and the loading of the particle formulation in the \nSuspension vehicle. The Viscosity of the Suspension vehicle \nmay be varied by altering the type or relative amount of the \nSolvent or polymer used. \n0.135  The suspension vehicle may have a viscosity rang \ning from about 100 poise to about 1,000,000 poise, prefer \nably from about  1,000 poise to about 100,000 poise.  In \npreferred embodiments, the Suspension vehicles typically \nhave a viscosity, at 33\u00b0C., of between about 5,000 to about \n30,000 poise,  preferably  between about 8,000 to  about \n25,000 poise,  more preferably between about  10,000 to \nabout 20,000 poise.  In one embodiment, the suspension \nvehicle has a viscosity of about 15,000 poise, plus or minus \nabout 3,000 poise, at 33\u00b0C. The viscosity may be measured \nat 33\u00b0C., at a shear rate of 10/sec, using a parallel plate \nrheometer. \n0.136  The suspension vehicle may exhibit phase separa \ntion when contacted with the aqueous environment; how \never, typically the suspension vehicle exhibits substantially \nno phase  separation  as  a function  of temperature.  For \nexample, at a temperature ranging from approximately 0\u00b0C. \nto approximately 70\u00b0 C. and upon temperature cycling. Such \nas cycling from 4\u00b0C. to 370\u00b0 C. to 4\u00b0C., the suspension \nvehicle typically exhibits no phase separation. \n0.137  The suspension vehicle may be prepared by com \nbining the polymer and the solvent under dry conditions, \nSuch as in a dry box. The polymer and solvent may be \ncombined at an elevated temperature, such as from approxi \nmately 40\u00b0 C. to approximately 70\u00b0 C., and allowed to \nliquefy and form the single phase. The ingredients may be \nblended under vacuum to remove air bubbles produced from \nthe dry ingredients. The ingredients may be combined using \na conventional mixer, such as a dual helix blade or similar \nmixer, set at a speed of approximately 40 rpm. However, \nhigher speeds may also be used to mix the ingredients. Once \na liquid Solution of the ingredients is achieved, the Suspen \nsion vehicle may be cooled to room temperature. Differential \nscanning calorimetry (DSC) may be used to verify that the \nSuspension vehicle is a single phase. Further, the compo \nnents of the vehicle (e.g., the solvent and/or the polymer) \nmay be treated  to  substantially  reduce  or  substantially \nremove peroxides (e.g., by treatment with methionine; see, \ne.g.,  U.S.,  Patent  Application  Publication  No.  2007 \n0027105). \n0.138.  The highly concentrated drug particle formulation \nis  added to the Suspension vehicle to form a Suspension \nformulation. In some embodiments the Suspension formu \nlation  may comprise a highly concentrated drug particle \nformulation and a suspension vehicle and in other embodi \nments consist  essentially  of a highly  concentrated drug \nparticle formulation and a suspension vehicle. \n0.139.  The suspension formulation may be prepared by \ndispersing the particle formulation in the Suspension vehicle. \nThe suspension  vehicle  may be heated and the particle \nformulation  added to  the  suspension  vehicle  under dry \nconditions. The ingredients may be mixed under vacuum at \nan elevated temperature, such as from about 40\u00b0C. to about \n70\u00b0 C. The ingredients may be mixed at a sufficient speed, \nsuch as from about 40 rpm to about 120 rpm, and for a \n\n\fUS 2017/01 19854 A1 \n\nMay 4, 2017 \n\nSufficient amount of time, such as about 15 minutes, to \nachieve a uniform dispersion of the particle formulation in \nthe suspension vehicle. The mixer may be a dual helix blade \nor other suitable  mixer.  The resulting  mixture  may be \nremoved from the mixer, sealed in a dry container to prevent \nwater from contaminating the Suspension formulation, and \nallowed to cool to room temperature before further use, for \nexample, loading into an implantable drug delivery device, \nunit dose container, or multiple-dose container. \n0140.  The suspension formulation typically has an over \nall moisture content of less than about 10 wt %, preferably \nless than about 5 wt %, and more preferably less than about \n4 wt %. \n0141.  The suspension formulations of the present inven \ntion  are exemplified herein below with  reference  to  an \nincretin mimetic and an interferon (Example 2). Further, the \nstability of drug particle formulations suspended in a vehicle \nthat  is  biocompatible,  single-phase,  and non-aqueous is \ndescribed in Example 3B. These examples are not intended \nto be limiting. \n0142.  In  Summary, the components of the Suspension \nvehicle provide biocompatibility. Components of the sus \npension vehicle offer Suitable chemico-physical properties \nto  form stable  Suspensions  of highly  concentrated drug \nparticle formulations. These properties include, but are not \nlimited to, the following: viscosity of the Suspension; purity \nof the vehicle; residual moisture of the vehicle; density of \nthe vehicle; compatibility with the dry powders; compat \nibility  with implantable devices; molecular weight of the \npolymer; stability of the vehicle; and hydrophobicity and \nhydrophilicity  of the  vehicle.  These properties  can  be \nmanipulated and controlled, for example, by variation of the \nvehicle composition and manipulation of the ratio of com \nponents used in the Suspension vehicle. \n\n4.O.O DELIVERY OF SUSPENSION \nFORMULATIONS \n0143.  The suspension formulations described herein may \nbe used in an implantable drug delivery device to provide \nSustained delivery of a compound over an extended period \nof time, such as over weeks, months, or up to about one year, \nfor example, at least  about  1  month, at  least about  1.5 \nmonths, preferably at least about 3 months, preferably at \nleast  about 6 months, more preferably at  least  about 9 \nmonths, more preferably at least about 12 months. Such an \nimplantable drug delivery device is  typically capable of \ndelivering the compound at a desired flow rate over a desired \nperiod of time. The suspension formulation may be loaded \ninto the implantable drug delivery device by conventional \ntechniques. \n0144.  The suspension formulation may be delivered, for \nexample, using an osmotically,  mechanically, electrome \nchanically, or chemically driven drug delivery device. The \nhighly concentrated drug particle formulation is delivered at \na  flow  rate  that  delivers  a drug that  is  therapeutically \neffective to the subject in need of treatment by the drug. \n0145  The drug may be delivered over a period ranging \nfrom more than about one week to about one year or more, \npreferably for about one month to about a year or more, \nmore preferably for about three months to about a year or \nmore. The implantable drug delivery device may include a \nreservoir having at least one orifice through which the drug \nis  delivered.  The suspension formulation  may be stored \nwithin the reservoir.  In one embodiment, the implantable \n\ndrug delivery device is an osmotic delivery device, wherein \ndelivery of the drug is osmotically driven. Some osmotic \ndelivery  devices  and  their  component parts  have been \ndescribed, for example, the DUROSR) delivery device or \nsimilar devices (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,609,885; 5,728, \n396;  5,985,305;  5,997,527;  6,113,938;  6,132,420;  6,156, \n331;  6,217,906;  6,261,584;  6,270,787;  6,287,295;  6,375, \n978;  6,395,292;  6,508,808:  6,544,252:  6,635,268;  6,682, \n522;  6,923,800;  6,939,556;  6,976,981;  6,997,922;  7,014, \n636;  7,207,982;  7.112,335,  7,163,688;  U.S.  Patent \nPublication Nos. 2005-0175701, 2007-0281024, and 2008 \n0091176). \n0146  The DUROS(R) delivery device typically consists of \na cylindrical reservoir which contains the osmotic engine, \npiston, and drug formulation. The reservoir is capped at one \nend by a controlled-rate,  semipermeable membrane and \ncapped at the other end by a diffusion moderator through \nwhich drug formulation is released from the drug reservoir. \nThe piston separates the drug formulation from the osmotic \nengine and utilizes a seal to prevent the water in the osmotic \nengine compartment from entering the drug reservoir. The \ndiffusion  moderator is  designed, in  conjunction with the \ndrug formulation, to prevent body fluid from entering the \ndrug reservoir through the orifice. \n0147  The DUROS(R) device releases a drug at a prede \ntermined rate based on the principle of osmosis. Extracel \nlular fluid enters the DUROSR) device through a semiper \nmeable membrane directly into a salt engine that expands to \ndrive the piston at a slow and even delivery rate. Movement \nof the piston forces the drug formulation to be released \nthrough the orifice or exit port at a predetermined sheer rate. \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the reservoir of \nthe DUROSR) device is loaded with a suspension formula \ntion of the present invention, comprising a highly concen \ntrated  drug  particle  formulation,  wherein  the  device  is \ncapable of delivering the Suspension formulation to a subject \nover an extended period of time (e.g., about 1, about 3, about \n6, or about 12 months) at a pre-determined, therapeutically \neffective delivery rate. \n(0.148.  Implantable devices, for example, the DUROS(R) \ndevice, provide the following advantages for administration \nof a highly concentrated drug particle formulation:  true \nZero-order release of the beneficial agent pharmacokineti \ncally; long-term release period time (e.g., up to about 12 \nmonths); patient compliance; and reliable delivery and dos \ning of a drug. \n0149  Other implantable drug delivery devices may be \nused in the practice of the present invention and may include \nregulator-type  implantable  pumps  that  provide  constant \nflow, adjustable flow, or programmable flow of the com \npound, such as those available from Codman & Shurtleff, \nInc.  (Raynham,  Mass.),  Medtronic,  Inc.  (Minneapolis, \nMinn.), and Tricumed Medinzintechnik GmbH (Germany). \n0150.  The amount of highly concentrated drug particle \nformulation employed in the delivery device of the invention \nis that amount necessary to deliver a therapeutically effec \ntive amount of the agent to achieve the desired therapeutic \nresult.  In  practice,  this  will  vary  depending upon Such \nvariables, for example, as the particular agent, the site of \ndelivery,  the severity  of the  condition, and the  desired \ntherapeutic effect. Examples of approximate release rates of \nexemplary highly concentrated drug particle formulations of \nthe present invention are presented in Example 4, including \n\n\fUS 2017/01 19854 A1 \n\nMay 4, 2017 \n\nrelease rates for exenatide (FIG. 2, FIG. 3, and FIG. 5) and \nrelease rates for omega interferon (FIG. 1 and FIG. 4). \n0151.  The data presented in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 illustrate \nanother aspect  of the  present  invention  wherein  highly \nconcentrated drug particles of the present invention can be \nused in a method of controlling the release rate of a drug by \nvarying the weight percent of the particles loaded into a \nSuspension formulation, the concentration of the drug in the \nparticle formulation, or both. Such a method is  useful to \nprepare osmotic delivery devices able to deliver customiz \nable concentrations of drug over time, wherein a series of \nstock particle formulations covering a range of drug con \ncentrations/particle can be used individually or in combina \ntion  over a range  of particle  loading concentrations  to \nprovide delivery of a selected concentration of drug over \ntime. This allows for efficiencies in manufacturing to pre \npare different dosing regimens or even provide for custom \nized dosing of individuals, for example by weight. Thus, \ndifferent dose levels can be provided as needed. \n0152  Typically, for an osmotic delivery device, the vol \nume of a beneficial agent chamber comprising the beneficial \nagent formulation is between about 100 ul to about 1000 ul, \nmore preferably between about 120 ul and about 500 ul, \nmore preferably between about 150 ul and about 200 ul. \n0153.  Typically, the osmotic delivery device is implanted \nwithin the subject, for example, subcutaneously. The device \n(s) can be inserted subcutaneously into either or both arms \n(e.g., in the inside, outside, or back of the upper arm) or the \nabdomen. Preferred locations in the abdomen are under the \nabdominal skin in the area extending below the ribs and \nabove the belt line. To provide a number of locations for \ninsertion of one or more osmotic delivery device within the \nabdomen, the abdominal wall can be divided into 4 quad \nrants as follows: the upper right quadrant extending 5-8 \ncentimeters below the right ribs and about 5-8 centimeters to \nthe right of the midline, the lower right quadrant extending \n5-8 centimeters above the belt line and 5-8 centimeters to the \nright of the midline, the upper left quadrant extending 5-8 \ncentimeters below the left ribs and about 5-8 centimeters to \nthe left of the midline, and the lower left quadrant extending \n5-8 centimeters above the belt line and 5-8 centimeters to the \nleft of the midline. This provides multiple available loca \ntions for implantation of one or more devices on one or more \noccasions. \n0154  The suspension formulations of the present inven \ntion comprising highly concentrated drug particle formula \ntions may also be delivered from a drug delivery device that \nis  not implantable or implanted, for example, an external \npump such as a peristaltic pump used for Subcutaneous \ndelivery in a hospital setting. \n0155  The suspension formulations of the present inven \ntion may also be used in infusion pumps, for example, the \nALZETR)  (DURECT  Corporation,  Cupertino  Calif.) \nosmotic pumps which are miniature, infusion pumps for the \ncontinuous dosing of laboratory animals (e.g.,  mice and \nrats). \n0156  The suspension formulations of the present inven \ntion may also be used in the form of injections to provide \nhighly concentrated bolus doses of drug. \n0157  Some advantages and benefits of the suspension \nformulations  of the  present  invention  delivered  via  an \nosmotic  delivery  device,  such  as  a  DUROSR  device, \ninclude,  but are not limited  to  the following.  Increased \ntreatment compliance can result in better efficacy and Such \n\nincreased compliance can be achieved using an implanted \nosmotic  delivery  device.  Efficacy  of treatment  can  be \nimproved because an implantable osmotic delivery device, \nsuch as a DUROSR) device, can provide continuous and \nconsistent delivery of drug 24 hours per day. Also, unlike \nother Sustained release formulations and depot injections, \ndrug dosing when using a DUROSR) device can be imme \ndiately halted by removal of the device, for example, if a \nsafety issue arises for a particular Subject. \n0158.  The present invention also includes  methods of \nmanufacturing the formulations of the present invention, \nincluding the particle formulations, Suspension vehicles, and \nsuspension formulations described herein above. The pres \nent  invention  also  includes  methods  of  manufacturing \nosmotic delivery devices comprising, for example, loading a \nselected  Suspension  formulation  into  a  reservoir  of an \nosmotic delivery device. \n\n5.O.O SUSPENSION FORMULATIONUSES \n0159.  The suspension formulations as described herein \nprovide promising alternatives to many therapies requiring \ndaily dosing of a selected drug. For example, the Suspension \nformulations of the present invention comprising highly \nconcentrated incretin mimetic particle formulations may be \nuseful in the treatment of diabetes (e.g., diabetes mellitus, \nand gestational  diabetes),  and diabetic  related  disorders \n(e.g., diabetic cardiomyopathy, insulin resistance, diabetic \nneuropathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, cata \nracts, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, \nhyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and tis \nSue ischemia, particularly myocardial ischemia), as well as, \nhyperglycemia (e.g., related to treatment with medications \nthat  increase  the  risk  of hyperglycemia,  including  beta \nblockers, thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, niacin, pentami \ndine, protease inhibitors, L-asparaginase, and some antip \nsychotic agents), reducing food intake (e.g., treating obesity, \ncontrolling appetite, or reducing weight), stroke, lowering \nplasma lipids, acute coronary syndrome, hibernating myo \ncardium, regulating gastrointestinal motility, and increasing \nurine flow. \n0160.  In addition,  the suspension formulations of the \npresent invention may be potential regulators of appetite in \nsubjects treated with the formulations. \n0.161  AS another example, highly concentrated drug par \nticle formulations comprising an interferon may be useful \nfor the treatment of interferon-responsive disorders, such as \nviral infection, immune disorders, and cancers. Treatment of \nSuch interferon-responsive disorders is generally carried out \nover an extended period of time.  For example,  omega \ninterferon can be used for the treatment of viral infections, \nfor example, Flavivirus infections (e.g., hepatitis C, yellow \nfever,  and West Nile;  Buckwold, V. E.,  et al.,  Antiviral \nResearch 73:118-125 (2007)). Non-compliance with dosing \nschedules has historically been a problem for Such long-term \ntreatments.  The Suspension  formulations  of the  present \ninvention when provided in, for example, osmotic delivery \ndevices, provide a desirable alternative to daily injections. \n0162.  In one embodiment, suspension formulations are \nadministered using an osmotic delivery device as described \nabove. The release rates of the suspension formulations of \nthe present invention provide osmotic delivery systems that \nconsistently and uniformly deliver drug at a selected deliv \nery rate over extended periods of time. Examples of achieve \nment of delivery rates using the Suspension formulations of \n\n\fUS 2017/01 19854 A1 \n\nMay 4, 2017 \n\nthe present invention are provided in Example 4. The release \nrate data indicated that the systems consistently and uni \nformly deliver drug at an approximate delivery rate of 50 \nug/day for interferon (FIG. 1), an approximate rate of 75 \nug/day exenatide (FIG. 2), and an approximate rate of 80 \nug/day exenatide (FIG. 3). \n0163  An exit sheer rate of the suspension formulation \nfrom the osmotic delivery device is determined such that the \ndaily target delivery rate of the drug is reasonably achieved \nby Substantially continuous, uniform delivery of the Suspen \nsion  formulation  from  the  osmotic  delivery  device. \nExamples of exit sheer rates include, but are not limited to, \nabout 1 to about 1x107 reciprocal second, preferably about \n4x10\u00b0 to about 6x10\" reciprocal second, more preferably \n5x10  to 1x10  reciprocal second. \n\n6.O.O OSMOTIC DELIVERY DEVICES \n0164.  The highly concentrated drug particle formulations \nof the present invention may be delivered,  for example, \nusing osmotic delivery systems. In one embodiment, the \npresent invention relates to use of osmotic delivery devices \nhaving reduced size relative to osmotic delivery devices in \ncurrent use. FIG. 6B shows a schematic representation of an \nosmotic delivery system having the dimensions of about 45 \nmm in  length and about 3.8  mm in  diameter.  Osmotic \ndelivery devices of this size have been used for the delivery \nof for example, omega interferon particle Suspension for \nmulations and exenatide particle Suspension formulations \n(\u201cContinuous Delivery of Stabilized Proteins and Peptides at \nConsistent  Rates  for  at  least  Three  Months  from  the \nDUROSR Device,  2008 American Association of Pharma \nceutical Sciences, Annual Meeting and Exposition, Poster \nNo. T3150, Nov. 18, 2008, Yang, B., et al.:  \u201cA Phase 1b \nStudy of ITCA 650: Continuous Subcutaneous Delivery of \nExenatide via DUROSR Device Lowers Fasting and Post \nprandial Plasma Glucose.\u201d American Diabetes Association \n69th Scientific Sessions, Jun. 5-9, 2009, Luskey, K., et al.: \nand \u201cA Phase 1b Study of ITCA 650: Continuous Subcuta \nneous Delivery of Exenatide via DUROSR Device Lowers \nFasting and Postprandial Plasma Glucose.\u201d European Asso \nciation for the Study of Diabetes 45th Annual Meeting, Sep. \n29 to Oct. 3, 2009, Luskey, K., et al.). The highly concen \ntrated drug particle formulations of the present invention \nfacilitate the use of osmotic delivery devices of even smaller \ndimensions while still providing the ability to provide con \ntinuous long-term delivery of controlled amounts of drug \nover time. For example, FIG. 6C shows a schematic repre \nsentation of an osmotic delivery system having the dimen \nsions of about 30 mm in  length  and about 3.8  mm in \ndiameter. By increasing the drug concentration in the drug \nparticle formulation, the amount of the drug particle Sus \npension formulation to be loaded into the osmotic delivery \ndevice can be reduced, the flow rate of the drug particle \nSuspension formulation can be reduced, and the size of the \nosmotic delivery device can also be reduced while main \ntaining the ability to provide continuous long-term delivery \nof predetermined amounts of drug over time. \n0.165  Embodiments  of implantable  osmotic  delivery \ndevices typically comprise the following components (see \nFIG. 6A): an impermeable reservoir, the interior walls of \nwhich define a lumen, a semipermeable membrane at a first \nend of the reservoir, a first chamber capable of containing an \nosmotic  agent,  a piston,  a second chamber capable  of \ncontaining a drug Suspension formulation, and a diffusion \n\nmoderator and orifice at a second end of the reservoir. The \nfirst chamber is defined by a first surface the semipermeable \nmembrane and a first  Surface of an adjacent piston. The \nsecond chamber is defined by a second Surface of the piston \nand a first surface of the diffusion moderator. \n(0166  FIG. 6A depicts an example of a DUROSR) deliv \nery system useful in the practice of the present invention. In \nFIG. 6A, the osmotic delivery device 10 is shown compris \ning a reservoir 12. A piston assembly 14 is positioned in the \nlumen of the reservoir and divides  the lumen into  two \nchambers.  In  this  example, the  chamber 16  contains  a \nbeneficial agent formulation and the chamber 20 contains an \nosmotic agent formulation. A semipermeable membrane 18 \nis positioned at a distal end of the reservoir, adjacent the \nchamber 20 containing the osmotic agent formulation. A \ndiffusion moderator 22 is positioned in mating relationship \nat a distal end of the reservoir 12, adjacent the chamber 16 \ncontaining the Suspension formulation, comprising the drug. \nThe diffusion moderator 22 includes a delivery orifice 24. \nThe diffusion moderator 22 may be any suitable flow device \nhaving a delivery orifice. In this embodiment, the flow path \n26 is formed between a threaded diffusion moderator 22 and \nthreads 28 formed on the interior surface of the reservoir 12. \nIn alternative embodiments, the diffusion moderator can, for \nexample, (i) be press-fit (or friction fit) through an opening \nand contacting a Smooth interior Surface of the reservoir, or \n(ii) comprise two pieces with an outer shell constructed and \narranged  for  positioning  in  an  opening,  an  inner  core \ninserted in the outer shell, and a fluid channel having a spiral \nshape defined between the outer shell and the inner core \n(e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007-0281024). \n(0167  Fluid is imbibed into the chamber 20 through the \nsemipermeable membrane 18. The beneficial agent formu \nlation is dispensed from the chamber 16 through the delivery \norifice 24 in the diffusion moderator 22. The piston assembly \n14 engages and seals against the interior wall of the reservoir \n12, thereby isolating the osmotic agent formulation in cham \nber 20 and fluid imbibed through the semipermeable mem \nbrane 18 from the beneficial agent formulation in chamber \n16. At steady-state, the Suspension formulation is expelled \nthrough the delivery orifice 24 in the diffusion moderator 22 \nat a rate corresponding to the rate at which external fluid is \nimbibed into the chamber 20 through the semipermeable \nmembrane  18.  That  is,  the  DUROSR) delivery  device \nreleases drug at a predetermined rate based on the principle \nof osmosis. Extracellular fluid enters the DUROSR) delivery \ndevice through the semipermeable membrane directly into \nthe osmotic engine that expands to drive the piston at a slow \nand consistent rate of travel. Movement of the piston forces \nthe drug formulation to be released through the orifice of the \ndiffusion  moderator resulting  in  Substantial  steady-state \ndelivery of the drug. \n0.168.  The semipermeable membrane 18 may be in the \nform of a plug that is resiliently engaged in sealing rela \ntionship with the interior surface of the reservoir 12. In FIG. \n6A, it  is  shown to have ridges that serve to  frictionally \nengage the semipermeable membrane 18 with the interior \nsurface of the reservoir 12. \n0169  Embodiments of osmotic delivery devices having \nreduced size  typically  comprise similar  components as \ndescribed relative to  FIG. 6A. Osmotic delivery devices \ncurrently in use typically have the dimensions shown in FIG. \n6B, that is, about 45 mm in length and about 3.8 mm in \ndiameter. An osmotic delivery device having reduced size \n\n\fUS 2017/01 19854 A1 \n\nMay 4, 2017 \n\nrelative to the devices currently in use in shown in FIG. 6C \nhaving the dimensions of about 30 mm in length and about \n3.8 mm in diameter. A marker band (e.g., the laser marker \nband shown in FIG. 6B and FIG. 6C) is optional and can be \nused, for example, to mark devices having different dosages \nor different drug suspensions to distinguish between devices \nand further may be useful for assisting with determination of \nthe desired insertion orientation for implantation. An exter \nnal groove (e.g., as shown in FIG. 6B and FIG. 6C) is also \noptional and is typically used to assist in identification of the \nsemipermeable membrane end of the device and determi \nnation  of the desired orientation  of the device insertion \norientation for implantation. \n0170  The reservoirs  of the osmotic delivery  devices, \nhaving reduced size, of the present invention are typically \nmade of a material impermeable to the environment of use \n(e.g., bodily fluids) and impermeable to the osmotic agent as \nwell as the drug suspension formulation. Preferred materials \nfor the reservoir include, but are not limited to, titanium and \ntitanium alloys.  Exemplary sizes of the reservoir for the \ndevices of the present invention include osmotic delivery \ndevices having an overall length of between about 35 mm \nand about 20 mm in length, preferably between about 30 mm \nand about 25 mm in length, more preferably about 28 mm \nto 33 mm in length, and a diameter of between about 8 mm \nand about 3 mm, preferably a diameter of about 3.8-4 mm. \nIn one embodiment, the osmotic delivery device has a length \nof about 30 mm and a diameter of about 3.8 mm. \n(0171  Exemplary embodiments of the components of the \nosmotic delivery devices and materials used for their manu \nfacture can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,728, \n396, 6,113,938, 6,132,420, 6,270,787, 6,375,978, 6,544,252, \n6,508,808,  5,997,527,  6,524,305,  6,287,295,  7,163,688, \n7,074,423,  7,014,636,  6,939,556,  7,207,982,  7,241,457, \n7,407,499, and U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2005-0010196, \n2005-0101943,  2005-0175701,  2007-0281024,  2008 \n0091176. Such components can be sized to provide osmotic \ndelivery devices having reduced size in view of the teach \nings of the present specification. \n0172.  In one embodiment, maintaining essentially  the \nsame reservoir diameter between larger and Smaller osmotic \ndelivery devices provides the advantage that the components \nof the two devices other than the reservoir (e.g., semiper \nmeable membrane, piston, and diffusion moderator) can be \nmanufactured in one size and the components used inter \nchangeable between the two devices. Similarly, a range of \ndevices having a range of reservoir lengths can be provided \nwherein the remaining components can be used interchange \nably for the manufacture of multiple devices having different \nreservoirs of different length and thus of different volume \nand drug loading capacity. \n\n7.O.O SOME ADVANTAGES OF THE HIGHLY \nCONCENTRATED DRUG PARTICLE \nFORMULATIONS OF THE PRESENT \nINVENTION \n0173  Particles  that  are  highly  concentrated with  the \nactive drug are useful for preparing osmotic delivery devices \nthat can deliver high doses of the drug while keeping the \noverall size of the device small enough to be implanted \neasily and remain acceptable to the patient. Highly concen \ntrated drug particle formulations may be particularly useful \nwhen high doses of a selected drug are required for effica \ncious treatment of a disease or condition.  In particular, \n\nhighly concentrated drug particle formulations extend the \nutility and use of osmotic delivery devices to drugs with \nlower potency that require doses typically considered too \nhigh for Such devices; for example, proteins such as GLP-1. \nexenatide, PYY. oxyntomodulin, GIP, interferon (e.g., alpha, \nbeta, gamma, lambda, omega, tau, consensus, and Variant \ninterferons), antibodies, or Small molecules such as testos \nterone or other steroids. Highly concentrated particles also \nfacilitate preparation of high dose osmotic delivery devices \nthat are needed for dose ranging studies both for animal \ntoxicology studies and for initial  dose-finding studies  in \nhumans. \n0.174 \nHighly concentrated drug particles are also useful \nfor preparing osmotic delivery  devices that  can deliver \ntherapeutic doses of a drug for an extended period of time. \nThese are particularly useful for treating chronic diseases \nand conditions such as diabetes and obesity where fewer \ndevice  replacements  per year are  desirable.  Example 5 \ndemonstrates that highly concentrated particles are useful \nfor preparing implantable osmotic delivery devices that can \ndeliver doses of a drug for extended periods of time at \ndesired delivery rates. \n0.175.  By contrast, suspension formulations comprising \nparticle formulations containing relatively low concentra \ntions of active drug (less  than about 20%) require high \nparticle loads in order to achieve high daily drug doses. \nHigher daily doses require higher weight percents of par \nticles and may result in formulations that are difficult to \npump reliably through the diffusion moderator of the device. \nSuch high particle loads may cause, for example, either \nphysical blockage of the outlet channel or internal devices \npressures sufficient to cause device failure from expulsion of \nthe semipermeable membrane. While one potential solution \nmight be to  increase the diameter of the outlet channel \nand/or decrease the  length  of the  outlet  channel.  Such \nstrategies may allow ingress of moisture from body fluids \ninto the drug formulation chamber via the diffusion mod \nerator and result in either instability of the drug or physical \ninstability of the suspension and possible device failure. \n0176  Higher concentration of drug in the particles is \nuseful to maintain particle loads of approximately 30% or \nless, 20% or less, or preferably 10% or less of particles by \nweight relative to the weight of the entire suspension for \nmulation. Accordingly, advantages of the highly concen \ntrated drug particle formulations of the present invention \ninclude the ability to provide drug at higher concentration \nwhile maintaining lower particle loads in the Suspension \nformulation because of the higher drug concentration. \n0177  Highly  concentrated  drug particle  formulations \nwith higher concentrations of the active drug may also have \nadvantages for the production process and overall process \nyields. The production of particles typically begins with a \nSolution of the drug in water, followed by a drying step such \nas spray drying or lyophilization. Proteins, in particular, are \nnot stable in aqueous solutions, therefore it is important to \nminimize the amount of time the drug is exposed to water. \nHigher concentrations of the drug in solution means rela \ntively lower quantity of water that must be removed in the \ndrying process and thereby a faster drying process. A faster \ndrying process may be particularly important for preparation \nof drug  particles  comprising  drug  molecules  that  are \nunstable  to  high  temperatures  and/or when exposed to \nmoisture. \n\n\fUS 2017/01 19854 A1 \n\nMay 4, 2017 \n\n0.178  An additional benefit may be that the sizes of the \nparticles formed by the faster drying process are Smaller \nthan the particles formed using a lower concentration. Pro \nviding smaller particles further reduces the potential  for \nclogging the outlet channel of the diffusion moderator and \nmay facilitate  use  of Smaller  channel  diameters  and/or \nlengths if required for the reliability and performance of \nparticular  osmotic  delivery  device/formulation  combina \ntions. \n0179  Another advantage of the suspension formulations \ncomprising highly concentrated drug particle formulations \nof the present invention is the ability to use osmotic delivery \ndevices of reduced size  for  delivery  of the  drug while \nmaintaining the ability to provide long-term, continuous \ndelivery of a desired drug concentration. In one embodi \nment, the present invention relates to an osmotic delivery \ndevice having an overall length of between about 35 mm and \nabout 20 mm in length, preferably between about 30 mm and \nabout 25 mm in length, more preferably about 28 mm to 33 \nmm in length, and a diameter of between about 8 mm and \nabout 3 mm, preferably a diameter of about 3.8-4 mm. The \nosmotic delivery device can be loaded with the suspension \nformulations comprising highly concentrated drug particle \nformulations of the present invention. Advantages of using \nthe osmotic delivery devices, having reduced size, of the \npresent invention (versus current osmotic delivery devices, \nfor example, having the dimensions shown in  FIG. 6B) \ninclude, but are not limited to, (i) improved ease of implan \ntation and removal, (ii) a larger number of possible implan \ntation sites (e.g., in the underside of the arms and throughout \nthe abdominal area), and (iii) reduced psychological impact \non patients regarding the implantation/removal of a foreign \nobject. \n0180  Further, the ability to use the suspension formula \ntions comprising highly concentrated drug particle formu \nlations of the present invention in a variety of different sizes \nof osmotic delivery devices allows tailoring of device size in \ncombination with drug concentration in Suspension formu \nlation  to  provide a wide array  of dosage  forms,  drug \nstrengths, and delivery durations. For example, Suspension \nformulations having the same drug concentration can be \nused for devices delivering the drug for at least about 1 \nmonth, at least about 1.5 months, preferably at least about 3 \nmonths, preferably at least about 6 months, more preferably \nat least about 9 months, and more preferably at least about \n12 months by filling reservoirs to different volumes. \n0181  Advantages of the highly concentrated drug par \nticle formulations of the present invention include improved \ndrug stability that allows broad geographical distribution, \nfor example, without refrigeration, and improved access to \ndrugs normally having poor stability but that are stabilized \nin the highly concentrated drug particle formulations. Addi \ntional advantages of the Suspension formulations comprising \nhighly concentrated drug particle formulations of the present \ninvention include the ability to deliver more drug in less \nVolume, delivering less of the non-drug components of the \nSuspension formulation, improved patient compliance with \ntreatments of prolonged duration, and reduced possible drug \nside-effects (e.g., nausea and/or vomiting) because of con \nsistent delivery of the drug without peaks or troughs of drug \nconcentration. \n0182.  Other objects may be apparent to one of ordinary \nskill upon reviewing the following specification and claims. \n\nEXPERIMENTAL \n0183  The following examples are put forth  so as  to \nprovide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete \ndisclosure and description of how to  make and use the \ndevices, methods, and formulae of the present invention, and \nare not intended to limit the scope of what the inventor \nregards as the invention. Efforts have been made to ensure \naccuracy  with  respect  to  numbers used  (e.g.,  amounts, \ntemperature, etc.) but some experimental errors and devia \ntions should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, \nparts are parts by weight, molecular weight is weight aver \nage molecular weight, temperature is in degrees Centigrade, \nand pressure is at or near atmospheric. \n0.184  The compositions produced according to the pres \nent invention meet the specifications for content and purity \nrequired of pharmaceutical products. \n\nExample 1 \n\nHighly Concentrated Drug Particle Formulations \n0185.

"I bought these for my girls and husband, they love them. The noodles are delicious and have wonderful flavor, not just heat with no flavor. Although they are a little too hot for me to eat very many, my girls and husband eat them like they are going out of style!",5,amazon
"Yeah, here's the thing...they DO taste like burning but they're delicious too lol. The noodles are nice and bouncy plus they collect the spicy fire sauce well. The sauce is flavorful so you want to keep slurping the noodles even though you wanna stop the flames in your mouth. I also add 2-3 frozen dumplings while the noodles are boiling. Just something extra to accompany the burn :) But really these are tasty if you can handle the spice level. ",5,amazon
This were incredible. Tastes just like the ramen I remember having overseas. Came super quick and we'll packaged. The taste was great. It's extremely spicy so if your not into that get one of the lower prices levels. But over all it's great.,5,amazon
"This is hands down the best ramen noodles ever. Perfect for those who love to eat spicy food. It is sweet, savory and spicy. Comes with a spicy sauce packet, a nori flakes and sesame packet to put after cooking the noodles. Definitely recommend for all, and if you cant handle the spice level, try putting a little less sauce.",5,influenster
"If you're looking for a real food challenge these noodles will give you a run for your money. They can be found at any asian supermarket and are very inexpensive. You can buy them as single pack, noodle bowl, or a large pack. They also come in different flavors such as chicken, carbonara, and more. Extremely spicy but extremely delicious.",5,influenster
"These noodles are sooo good . So much flavor! The noodles are a little thick , therefore they don't get soggy. They are very very spicy! But I love the flavor. Even though they are spicy I just can't stop eating. It's not your regular noodles! Packed with flavor guys tastes amazing! Try them .I got them for $2.99 at my local Asian market",5,influenster
I first got this ramen because I love spicy foods and have a high heat tolerance. Also I saw a challenge online with it and I wanted to try it out. I LOVED IT SO MUCH. Its so tasty and spicy just like promised. The spice was mostly on my lips but it was worth it since not only was it spicy it tasted really good. It is fairly easy to prepare. The package tells you that you have to fry it after you cook it but I dont and it tastes the same as when I do. ,5,influenster
"Wow if you're keys disappointed by ramens not being hot get this. It's not the hottest no but it's quite hot & can still be enjoyed. Other than being spicy, it's very tasty too! You can taste the chicken flavor & even the added seaweed & sesame seeds on top when you eat this, then it starts to turn spicy. They have a x2 one if you dare. This one is pretty hot tho but can still be tackled by the spicy ramen challenge, especially when there isn't a time limit to the rules haha!",5,influenster
"I love these. It’s the perfect instant dried noodles, with the efficient amount of hotness. I know people who eat these as noodle soup but i much rather boil the noodles then stir fry it with the red sauce. I also often add a sunny-side-up egg, veggies cut in a julian style to make it a complete meal instead of a quick bite. If you can’t handle too much spice like my husband, you don’t have to use to whole bag of the red sauce, half a bag will do just fine. I’ve been cutting back on carbs so I can’t eat these three four times a week like i used to. But you should definitely give them a try!",5,influenster

"Okay so they are spicy, not too spicy either. My biggest problem was no flavor. It says chicken on it but hardly taste any of the chicken flavor. :(",4,amazon
Extremely hot EVEN IF YOU USE A LITTLE SAUCE.. i would love if i could tolerate that much spice! If you have no problem with spice i recommend!,4,amazon
they Are my go to food when I’m stressed out and craving spicy food,4,amazon
"Spicy ramen is the way to go! If you love spicy food then you are going to want to try this! Who doesn’t love ramen and now that there’s a super spicy version, ramen just got better! Will repurchase as soon as possible!",4,influenster
"I thought these were spicy until I tried the 2x spicy pack... I can still feel the burning sensation on my lips! But back to this packet, the burn on these isn't too bad and the flavor is actually really nice with a light sweetness too it, almost like gochujang. The noodles are thicker than many other ramens and are similar to shin noodles; they're pretty springy and have a nice chew! Overall, these are great, just make sure you can handle your spice!!",4,influenster
"There were so many ""spiciest ramen challenges"" online, I just had to order it for myself to try. I love spicy food items, being from Southeast Asia, and this does hit the spot. It is however, pretty spicy for the average person I think. My husband couldn't really handle it, though he likes spicy items too. The heat builds as you eat more... but yum!",4,influenster
"My family likes spicy food, but this was too spicy for us. The instructions didn’t translate properly either. I don’t know what this is “Reamin 8 spoons of water”. Add 8 teaspoons of water?",3,amazon
These are the spiciest noodles I’ve ever tried. It’s almost impossible for me to finish a whole bowl. I only bought them to try to do the challenge of finishing it without drinking anything. They have good flavor but just crazy spicy!,3,influenster
I got this because I was fed to do the spicy noodle challenge. I bought it from T&T Supermarket and I thought the flavour was delicious.It was spicy so if your not good with spice this ramen is NOT for you. I would get it again,3,influenster
So spicy this flavour is incredible you get the amazing sensation of hot spice mixed with creamy hot chicken together a match made in heaven the only place where it fall's apart is the unhealthy ingredients in this so make sure you really read this,3,influenster
It's alright. Tastes like dry noodles and it's not that spicy really. They're an alright snack when there's nothing else around.,3,influenster

"The taste is good, but it's VERY spicy, and can almost be overpowering. I'm a big fan of spice so I didn't mind it but If spice isn't for you, you won't like this at all.",3,influenster
"omg! this is the spiciest ramen noodles i have ever tried! i love spicy but this is some next level of spice! i love the flavor but i would never it this again, unless i will not put the whole seasoning in the noodles. if you love spicy food on any level of spice, i recommend this ramen and better put some egg in it. i love it but at the same time i will just mix it with something else to lessen the spicyness.",3,influenster
"Very disappointed with this instant noodle. The spice level is pretty up there, but not worth tolerating for what it actually tastes like.",2,influenster
"I will admit, these noodles got a kick so strong I do struggle to keep my nose in check. Flavor wise however? I can't taste the chicken they say it has. This among other samyang noodles I bought in a variety pack on Amazon had so little flavor. As much as I enjoyed the spice, I would prefer if these noodles had more to offer.",2,influenster
"This is one super spicy ramen!! If your mouth and taste buds can handle it, I would defiantly recommend trying it. It's really good and easy to make! The chicken flavor is packed with MSG and seasoning!",5,influenster
I love noodles so much i hope too try this spicy chicken noodle alot of people make a challenge to eat this and i love to try the taste,1,influenster
This product is pretty bad. It has s horrible after taste and leaves your mouth with a weird feeling. It’s very easy and convenient yo cook but it is very and I would not eat this again. I do not recommend this to you.,1,influenster
"I had high hopes for this noddles since it's been going hot for a while now. But, it didn't really taste good. It was spicy. You could handle it if you do it in one go. I was kinda disappointed.",1,influenster
